## What does it mean for a joint probability density $p(\mathbf{x})$ to be non-negative and normalized?

The multivariate probability density $p(\mathbf{x})$, where $\mathbf{x}$ represents a vector of continuous variables $x_1, \ldots, x_D$, must statisfy two conditions: $p(\mathbf{x}) \geq 0$ for all $\mathbf{x}$ and $\int p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} = 1$, where the integral is taken over the entire space of $\mathbf{x}$.

These conditions ensure that $p(\mathbf{x})$ is a valid probability density: non-negativity ensures it's a proper probability measure, and normalization ensures that the total probability across the space of $\mathbf{x}$ sums to 1, representing a complete and exhaustive distribution of probabilities across all possible outcomes.

## How do the sum and product rules of probability extend to probability densities involving continuous variables $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$?

For continuous variables $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, the sum and product rules of probability are expressed in terms of integrals. The sum rule is given by $p(\mathbf{x}) = \int p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{y}$ and the product rule by $p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = p(\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{x}) p(\mathbf{x})$. 

These rules ensure that we can derive probabilities involving fewer variables from joint probabilities and conditional probabilities, and they are foundational principles in the theory of probability.

## How is Bayes' theorem applied in the context of continuous variables $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$?

For continuous variables $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, Bayes' theorem is given by $$p(\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{x}) = \frac{p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{y}) p(\mathbf{y})}{p(\mathbf{x})},$$ where the denominator $p(\mathbf{x})$ is derived from the integral $p(\mathbf{x}) = \int p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{y}) p(\mathbf{y}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{y}$.

This formulation allows us to update the probability of $\mathbf{y}$ given new information about $\mathbf{x}$, which is crucial in many applications including statistical inference and machine learning.

## Discuss the characteristics and normalization condition of the uniform distribution over a finite interval $(c, d)$.

The uniform distribution over the interval $(c, d)$ is defined by the density function $p(x) = \frac{1}{d-c}$ for $x \in (c, d)$ and $p(x) = 0$ otherwise. This density function is normalized such that $$\int_c^d \frac{1}{d-c} \mathrm{d} x = 1,$$ ensuring that the total probability over the interval $(c, d)$ is 1.

This distribution is used when each outcome within the interval is equally likely; it's a fundamental distribution in probability and statistics.

## Why must the formal derivation of sum and product rules for continuous variables require measure theory, and how can it be informally understood?

The formal derivation of sum and product rules for continuous variables relies on measure theory to rigorously deal with the infinities and infinitesimals in the integration process. Informally, this can be understood by dividing continuous intervals into discrete bins of width $\Delta$, forming a discrete probability distribution, and ultimately taking the limit as $\Delta \rightarrow 0$ to translate sums into integrals.

This approach bridges discrete probability concepts with continuous probability, highlighting how finer divisions approach the continuous case.
