## Derive the relationship between joint probability and conditional and marginal probabilities as shown in the given expressions.

From the provided equations, the relationship between joint probability $p(X,Y)$ and conditional and marginal probabilities is given by:
$$
p\left(X=x_i, Y=y_j\right) = p\left(Y=y_j \mid X=x_i\right) p\left(X=x_i\right)
$$
where $p\left(X=x_i, Y=y_j\right)$ is the joint probability of $X=x_i$ and $Y=y_j$, $p\left(Y=y_j \mid X=x_i\right)$ is the conditional probability of $Y=y_j$ given $X=x_i$, and $p\left(X=x_i\right)$ is the marginal probability of $X=x_i$.

## Explain the sum rule in probability theory.

The sum rule in probability theory is expressed as:
$$
p(X) = \sum_Y p(X, Y)
$$
This rule indicates that the marginal probability $p(X)$ of a random variable $X$ can be computed by summing over all possible values of another random variable $Y$, the joint probabilities $p(X,Y)$. It essentially reflects the totality of the ways $X$ can occur, across all conditions provided by $Y$.

## How does Bayes' Theorem relate conditional probabilities $p(Y \mid X)$ and $p(X \mid Y)$?

Bayes' Theorem is expressed as:
$$
p(Y \mid X) = \frac{p(X \mid Y) p(Y)}{p(X)}
$$
It shows how to update our belief about $Y$ given new information about $X$. $p(Y \mid X)$ is the probability of $Y$ given $X$, $p(X \mid Y)$ is the probability of $X$ given $Y$, $p(Y)$ is the prior probability of $Y$, and $p(X)$ is the prior probability of $X$ which acts as a normalization constant ensuring all probabilities sum to one.

## What is the normalization constant in Bayes' Theorem, and how is it derived?

In Bayes' Theorem
$$
p(Y \mid X) = \frac{p(X \mid Y) p(Y)}{p(X)}
$$
the denominator $p(X)$ is the normalization constant, ensuring the conditional probabilities sum to one. It can be derived using the sum rule:
$$
p(X) = \sum_Y p(X \mid Y) p(Y)
$$
This accounts for all the ways $X$ can occur summed over all values of $Y$ in the terms of the joint probabilities calculated as products of updated beliefs ($p(X \mid Y)$) and prior ($p(Y)$).

## Discuss the impact of changing notation in probability from explicit to compact on the clarity and efficiency of expression.

Changing the notation in probability from explicitly denoting random variables and their values (e.g., $p(X=x_i)$) to a more compact form (e.g., $p(x_i)$) can enhance the efficiency of mathematical expressions by reducing verbosity. However, it necessitates a clear context to avoid ambiguity. This notation shift is reflected in both simplified calculations and theoretical discussions, where clarity is not compromised by the reduced form.
