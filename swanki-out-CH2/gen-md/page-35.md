## What is the regularized sum-of-squares error function in the context of Bayesian machine learning?
The error function $$E(\mathbf{w})=\frac{1}{2 \sigma^{2}} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{y\left(x_{n}, \mathbf{w}\right)-t_{n}\right\}^{2}+\frac{1}{2 s^{2}} \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{w}$$ combines a data fidelity term and a regularization term which prevents overfitting by penalizing the magnitude of the coefficient vector $\mathbf{w}$. 

In Bayesian terms, this regularization arises naturally from the prior beliefs about the distribution of the parameters and is a key component in preventing overfitting, especially in the context of polynomial regression.

## How does the Bayesian perspective utilize regularization in machine learning?
The Bayesian perspective motivates the use of regularization as seen in the derivation of error functions, where regularization terms like $\frac{1}{2 s^{2}} \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{w}$ reflect prior beliefs about parameters' distributions. This encourages simpler models unless the data convincingly suggests more complex ones, aiding in the prevention of overfitting.

This principled approach to regularization vis-a-vis Bayesian techniques illustrates a stark contrast with conventional frequentist methods that might otherwise lead to overfitted models.

## Describe the process of making predictions in Bayesian machine learning.
In Bayesian machine learning, predictions for a target variable $t$ given a new input $x$ and the dataset $\mathcal{D}$ are based on the posterior predictive distribution: 
$$p(t \mid x, \mathcal{D})=\int p(t \mid x, \mathbf{w}) p(\mathbf{w} \mid \mathcal{D}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{w}.$$ This distribution integrates over all possible parameter values $\mathbf{w}$, using the posterior distribution $p(\mathbf{w} \mid \mathcal{D})$ as weights. 

This method contrasts with frequentist approaches that use point estimates and does not account for parameter uncertainty as robustly as the Bayesian method.

## How does Bayesian machine learning address the issue of model complexity?
Bayesian machine learning addresses model complexity through the process of averaging over models, where each model's contribution is weighted by its posterior probability. Models of appropriate complexity are more likely favored, as they balance the ability to fit the data without being overly complex, thus inherently avoiding over-fitting.

This approach stands in opposition to methods like maximum likelihood estimation, which can favor increasingly complex models irrespective of their parsimony or practical utility.

## What challenges arise in the practical application of Bayesian methods to modern machine learning models?
The major challenge in applying Bayesian methods to modern deep learning models lies in the computation of integrals over potentially millions or billions of parameters, as indicated by the expression:
$$\int p(t \mid x, \mathbf{w}) p(\mathbf{w} \mid \mathcal{D}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{w}.$$
Such integrations are often computationally prohibitive even with approximations, hindering the practical deployment of fully Bayesian methods in large-scale machine learning systems.

This computational bottleneck significantly constrains the scalability of Bayesian methods in contexts involving large model architectures or datasets.
