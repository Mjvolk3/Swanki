## What is the expression for the likelihood function of a Gaussian distributed target variable $t$ given $x$, $\mathbf{w}$, and $\sigma^2$?

The likelihood function is given by:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}, \sigma^{2}\right)=\prod_{n=1}^{N} \mathcal{N}\left(t_{n} \mid y\left(x_{n}, \mathbf{w}\right), \sigma^{2}\right)
$$

where $y(x_n, \mathbf{w})$ is the mean of the Gaussian distribution for a given $x_n$ and coefficients $\mathbf{w}$, and $\sigma^2$ is the variance.

## How is the log likelihood function derived from the product of Gaussian distributions?

The log likelihood function is derived by taking the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, leading to:

$$
\ln p\left(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}, \sigma^{2}\right) = -\frac{1}{2 \sigma^{2}} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{y\left(x_{n}, \mathbf{w}\right)-t_{n}\right\}^{2} - \frac{N}{2} \ln \sigma^{2} - \frac{N}{2} \ln (2 \pi)
$$

This transformation simplifies products into sums, which are easier to handle analytically and computationally.

## Describe how $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ML}}$, the maximum likelihood estimates of weights, is determined from the log likelihood.

$\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ML}}$ is determined by maximizing the log likelihood function with respect to $\mathbf{w}$. By dropping terms that do not depend on $\mathbf{w}$ and minimizing the negative of the remaining expression, $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ML}}$ is effectively obtained by minimizing:

$$
E(\mathbf{w})=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{y\left(x_{n}, \mathbf{w}\right)-t_{n}\right\}^{2}
$$

This comes from the part of the log likelihood function that depends on $\mathbf{w}$, showing the correspondence with the least squares error minimization.

## Explain the role of Gaussian noise assumption in the derivation of the sum-of-squares error function.

The assumption of Gaussian noise in the likelihood function leads directly to the derivation of the sum-of-squares error function. By simplifying the log likelihood function to exclude constant terms with respect to $\mathbf{w}$ and considering only the Gaussian component, the sum-of-squares emerges naturally as the function to minimize, aligning with methods used in regression analysis.

This underscores the relevance of the Gaussian noise model in ordinary least squares regression.

## How does the independence of $\sigma^2$ from $\mathbf{w}$ simplify the optimization process in finding $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ML}}$?

The independence of $\sigma^2$ from $\mathbf{w}$ allows us to omit terms involving $\sigma^2$ when maximizing the log likelihood with respect to $\mathbf{w}$. This simplification reduces the complexity of the maximization problem to focusing only on terms that involve $\mathbf{w}$, specifically minimizing the sum-of-squares error function. Thus, the optimization task becomes computationally more feasible and conceptually aligned with common practices in regression analysis where $\mathbf{w}$ is optimized separately from variance estimates.
