## How is the likelihood function for a Gaussian Distribution expressed given a set of i.i.d. data points $\{x_n\}$?
The likelihood function for a Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, given an i.i.d. set of data points $\{x_n\}$, is expressed as:
$$
p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right)=\prod_{n=1}^{N} \mathcal{N}\left(x_{n} \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right)
$$
This product of Gaussians quantifies how probable the observed data is across different parameter values, essentially guiding the optimization of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$.

## What simplification does taking the logarithm of the likelihood function introduce in the context of maximizing the likelihood?
Taking the logarithm of the likelihood function:
$$
\ln p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right)=-\frac{1}{2 \sigma^{2}} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(x_{n}-\mu\right)^{2}-\frac{N}{2} \ln \sigma^{2}-\frac{N}{2} \ln (2 \pi)
$$
introduces simplification by turning the product of probabilities into a sum of logarithms. This prevents numerical underflow issues common with multiplying many small numbers and eases the application of calculus tools for optimization.

## How is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the mean $\mu$ calculated for a Gaussian distribution?
The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for the mean $\mu$ of a Gaussian distribution, given a data set $\{x_n\}$, is calculated as:
$$
\mu_{\mathrm{ML}}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n}
$$
This formula represents the arithmetic mean of the data points, derived by taking the derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to $\mu$ and setting it to zero.

## Why might maximizing the likelihood function seem counterintuitive in statistical estimation?
Maximizing the likelihood function, which involves maximizing the probability of the data given the parameters, might seem counterintuitive because it seems more natural to maximize the probability of the parameters given the data. However, this dilemma is resolved by understanding that these criteria are related through Bayes' theorem, although they address the estimation problem from different perspectives.

## Detail why maximizing the log of a function is equivalent to maximizing the function itself.
Maximizing the log of a function is equivalent to maximizing the function itself because the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function. This means that if the function value increases, its logarithm also increases, and vice versa. This property ensures that the maximum value of the original function and its logarithm occur at the same point.
