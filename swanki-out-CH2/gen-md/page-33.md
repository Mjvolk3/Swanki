## How does Bayes' Theorem relate prior and posterior probabilities in the context of Bayesian inference?
Bayes' theorem is pivotal in Bayesian inference, enabling the updating of prior probability estimates into posterior probabilities upon receiving new data. This updating is framed mathematically by Bayesâ€™ theorem as:

$$
p(\mathbf{w} \mid \mathcal{D}) = \frac{p(\mathcal{D} \mid \mathbf{w}) p(\mathbf{w})}{p(\mathcal{D})}
$$

Here, $p(\mathbf{w} \mid \mathcal{D})$ represents the posterior probability of the parameters $\mathbf{w}$ given the data $\mathcal{D}$, $p(\mathcal{D} \mid \mathbf{w})$ is the likelihood of the data under the parameters, $p(\mathbf{w})$ indicates the prior belief about the parameters, and $p(\mathcal{D})$ serves as a normalization factor ensuring that the posterior probabilities sum to one.

## What is the implication of the likelihood function $p(\mathcal{D} \mid \mathbf{w})$ in Bayesian analysis and why is it not a probability distribution?
In Bayesian analysis, the likelihood function $p(\mathcal{D} \mid \mathbf{w})$ expresses how probable the observed data set $\mathcal{D}$ is for different parameter values $\mathbf{w}$. It is crucial for updating the prior distribution into a posterior via Bayes' theorem. The key distinction of the likelihood function is that it is not inherently a probability distribution over $\mathbf{w}$ because its integral with respect to $\mathbf{w}$ does not necessarily sum to one. This property underscores that the likelihood function is fundamentally a measure of relative plausibility among different parameter values rather than an absolute probability measure.

## How does Bayesian inference differentiate from the maximum likelihood estimation in the interpretation of model parameters?
Bayesian inference incorporates prior beliefs about model parameters and updates these beliefs upon new data, providing a posterior distribution of the parameters. In contrast, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) solely maximizes the likelihood $p(\mathcal{D} \mid \mathbf{w})$, choosing $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ML}}$ that makes the observed data most probable, often without regard to prior information. MLE typically results in point estimates lacking a thorough uncertainty quantification that a Bayesian posterior distribution offers. This difference is particularly evident when assessing scenarios with sparse or noisy data - Bayesian methods can offer more robustness and reliability by leveraging prior knowledge effectively.

## Describe the impact of different choices of training datasets on Bayesian and maximum likelihood estimations of model parameters $\mathbf{w}$.
The choice and volume of the training dataset $\mathcal{D}$ significantly influence the estimations of model parameters $\mathbf{w}$. Under the Maximum Likelihood Estimation method, different datasets can lead to different estimates $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ML}}$. From the Bayesian perspective, varying data inputs alter the likelihood function $p(\mathcal{D} \mid \mathbf{w})$, prompting adjustments in the posterior distribution $p(\mathbf{w} \mid \mathcal{D})$. Hence, Bayesian analysis provides a framework to account for uncertainty and variability in $\mathbf{w}$ based on the data seen, which is critical in real-world applications where data could be imprecise or limited.

## How does incorporating prior knowledge naturally arise within the Bayesian framework, and what are its implications for inference?
Incorporating prior knowledge in Bayesian inference occurs through the prior probability distribution $p(\mathbf{w})$, which quantitatively expresses prior beliefs or hypotheses about the model parameters before observing any data. This integration of prior knowledge allows for reasoned updates to these beliefs as data is acquired, thus refining the model's parameters estimation through the posterior distribution $p(\mathbf{w} \mid \mathcal{D})$. This methodology stands in contrast to non-Bayesian approaches that often start from a lack of prior context, potentially leading to less nuanced inferences, especially in cases of data sparsity or ambiguity.
