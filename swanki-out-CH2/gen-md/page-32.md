## What does the mutual information between two variables indicate about their independence?
   
Mutual information of variables $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, denoted as $\mathrm{I}[\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}]$, is derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence of their joint distribution from the product of their marginal distributions. This value quantifies the degree of dependency between the variables.

$$
\mathrm{I}[\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}] = \mathrm{KL}(p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) \| p(\mathbf{x}) p(\mathbf{y})) = -\iint p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) \ln \left(\frac{p(\mathbf{x}) p(\mathbf{y})}{p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})}\right) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{y}
$$

Mutual information $\mathrm{I}[\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}]$ equals zero if and only if the variables $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are independent.

## How is mutual information related to conditional entropy?

Mutual information between variables $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ can be expressed using conditional entropies as follows:

$$
\mathrm{I}[\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}]=\mathrm{H}[\mathbf{x}]-\mathrm{H}[\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{y}]=\mathrm{H}[\mathbf{y}]-\mathrm{H}[\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{x}]
$$

This equation illustrates that mutual information quantifies the reduction in uncertainty of one variable due to the knowledge of the other.

## What foundational principle allows probabilities in Bayesian theory to be used as a measure of uncertainty?
  
Cox's theorem (1946) underpins the Bayesian probability framework, which posits probabilities as a measure of belief or uncertainty. Cox's theorem asserts that if numerical values represent degrees of belief, common sense properties of these beliefs dictate a set of rules equivalent to the sum and product rules of probability.

This relationship underlies the Bayesian interpretation, where probabilities reflect the quantification of uncertainty rather than mere frequencies.

## What is the significance of Bayesian probabilities in the context of observing new data?

From a Bayesian perspective, observing new data can help update our beliefs or probabilities regarding outcomes, illustrated as moving from a prior distribution to a posterior. This approach is essential in incremental learning where observations continuously refine our understanding or predictions.

The Bayesian framework allows for the updating of probabilities, emphasizing the role of data in revising beliefs, corresponding to the changes in probabilities from prior to posterior distribution.

## How does the classical interpretation of probability differ from the Bayesian interpretation?
  
The classical (or frequentist) interpretation of probability is grounded in the frequencies of repeatable events, exemplified in scenarios like predicting the outcome of a coin toss based solely on repetition and proportion.

In contrast, the Bayesian interpretation views probabilities as a measure of uncertainty or subjective belief about events, which can be updated with new evidence or data. This reflects a more fluid and context-dependent approach to probability, adaptable to new information unlike the deterministic nature of the frequentist approach.
