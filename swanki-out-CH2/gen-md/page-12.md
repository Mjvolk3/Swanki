## Explain the formula for the exponential distribution and its behavior.
The exponential distribution is a continuous statistical distribution used to model the time between events in a process where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. The probability density function (PDF) of the exponential distribution is given by:

$$
p(x \mid \lambda)=\lambda \exp (-\lambda x), \quad x \geqslant 0
$$

where $\lambda > 0$ is the rate parameter, which often reflects the frequency of occurrence of events. The function $\exp(-\lambda x)$ represents the exponential decay in probability as $x$ (often time) increases. This distribution is notably memoryless, meaning the probability of an event occurring in the next time interval is the same regardless of when the last event occurred.

## Define the Laplace distribution and describe its PDF.
The Laplace distribution is a two-parameter family of distributions that can be used to model differences between two independent exponentially distributed variables. It is expressed by the following probability density function (PDF):

$$
p(x \mid \mu, \gamma)=\frac{1}{2 \gamma} \exp \left(-\frac{|x-\mu|}{\gamma}\right)
$$

Here, $\mu$ is the location parameter, which defines the peak of the distribution, and $\gamma$ is the scale parameter, which describes the spread or divergence from the peak. Unlike the normal distribution which is symmetrical, the Laplace distribution can adapt to a sharper peak at its mean, providing a way to model data with heavier tails.

## Discuss the Dirac delta function and its application in probability theory.
The Dirac delta function, denoted as $\delta(x-\mu)$, is not a function in the conventional sense but rather a distribution. It is defined to be zero everywhere except at $x = \mu$ where it is theoretically infinite:

$$
p(x \mid \mu)=\delta(x-\mu)
$$

The key property of the Dirac delta function is that it integrates to 1 over the entire real line, effectively "selecting" the value at $x = \mu". In practical terms, it is used in probability to model variables that are known to take on a specific value with certainty. The Dirac delta function is particularly useful in theoretical work, such as signal processing or quantum mechanics, and in constructing discrete probability distributions from empirical data samples.

## Define the empirical distribution function using the Dirac delta function for a finite sample set.
Given a finite set of observations $\mathcal{D}=\{x_1, \ldots, x_N\}$, the empirical distribution function can be constructed using the Dirac delta function as follows:

$$
p(x \mid \mathcal{D})=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \delta(x-x_n)
$$

This formula represents a probability density that places a mass of $1/N$ at each observed data point $x_n$. Essentially, it creates a spike at each data point location, and these spikes are the only places where the density is non-zero. The empirical distribution is a practical way to summarize and use discrete observations in statistical analysis, modeling them as if they were sampled from a continuous distribution.

## Explain the concept of expectation for a function under a probability distribution and its calculation in the discrete case.
The expectation of a function $f(x)$ under a probability distribution $p(x)$ is a fundamental concept in statistics, representing the average or expected value of $f(x)$ when the randomness of $x$ is taken into account. This is mathematically denoted and calculated in the discrete case as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[f] = \sum_x p(x) f(x)
$$

This formula sums the products of $p(x)$, the probability of $x$, and $f(x)$, the value of the function at each $x$. The expectation, therefore, provides a single summary measure of $f(x)$ weighted by the probability distribution, offering a sense of the central tendency or "average" outcome of $f(x)$ over its range of possibilities in discrete scenarios.
