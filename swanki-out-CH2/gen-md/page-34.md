## How does the normalization constant $p(\mathcal{D})$ relate to the prior and likelihood in Bayes' theorem?

$p(\mathcal{D})$ is expressed as an integral of the product of the likelihood and the prior:
$$
p(\mathcal{D}) = \int p(\mathcal{D} \mid \mathbf{w}) p(\mathbf{w}) \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{w}.
$$
This calculation ensures that the posterior distribution integrates to one, thus forming a valid probability density.

## How is the likelihood function $p(\mathcal{D} \mid \mathbf{w})$ used differently in Bayesian and frequentist settings?

In Bayesian analysis, $p(\mathcal{D} \mid \mathbf{w})$ contributes to expressing parameter uncertainty via a probability distribution over $\mathbf{w}$. In frequentist analysis, $\mathbf{w}$ is seen as fixed, and uncertainty is gauged through potential variability in $\mathcal{D}$.

## What is the formula for the maximum a posteriori estimate (MAP) used in regularization?

The MAP estimate can be found by maximizing the posterior probability (or minimizing its negative logarithm):
$$
-\ln p(\mathbf{w} \mid \mathcal{D}) = -\ln p(\mathcal{D} \mid \mathbf{w}) - \ln p(\mathbf{w}) + \ln p(\mathcal{D}),
$$
where $\ln p(\mathcal{D})$ is a constant with respect to $\mathbf{w}$ and can thus be ignored in optimization.

## Can you describe the regularization form when a Gaussian prior is applied to each parameter in Bayesian analysis?

When a Gaussian prior $p(\mathbf{w})$ with zero mean and variance $s^2$ is applied, the negative log posterior becomes:
$$
-\ln p(\mathbf{w} \mid \mathcal{D}) = -\ln p(\mathcal{D} \mid \mathbf{w}) + \frac{1}{2s^{2}} \sum_{i=0}^{M} w_{i}^{2} + \text{const.},
$$
showing regularization by penalizing the squared magnitudes of the parameters $\mathbf{w}$.

## How does applying a MAP estimate in linear regression work for minimizing the function relating to the likelihood and priors?

In the context of linear regression with a Gaussian prior, the equivalent functional form to be minimized in the regularized model is:
$$
\text{Minimize} \quad -\ln p(\mathcal{D} \mid \mathbf{w}) + \frac{1}{2s^2} \sum_{i=0}^{M} w_i^2,
$$
effectively balancing fit to the data against model complexity.
