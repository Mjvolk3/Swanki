## What are the two different interpretations of probability mentioned in the text?

Probability can be interpreted in two primary ways: as a frequency associated with a repeatable event, and as a quantification of uncertainty. The frequency interpretation reflects the traditional frequentist perspective of probability, reflecting how often an event occurs in repeated experiments. On the other hand, the quantification of uncertainty, embodied in the Bayesian perspective, sees probability as a way to express one's degree of belief in the occurrence of an event, particularly when the event itself cannot be repeated.

## How does the Bayesian perspective of probability encompass frequentist probability?

The Bayesian interpretation of probability is more general and includes the frequentist interpretation as a special case. From the Bayesian viewpoint, probability is used to quantify uncertainty about events or outcomes based on available evidence. When the Bayesian view accommodates scenarios with enough data from repeatable events, it effectively aligns with the frequentist interpretation, which solely relies on long-run frequencies of such events.

## What is the rationale behind assuming a probability of 0.5 for heads in a coin toss when the sides of the coin are unknown?

When it is unknown whether the convex side of the coin is heads or tails, symmetry in the physical properties of the coin suggests assuming equal probability of landing on either side. This means assigning a probability of $0.5$ to both outcomes. This assumption is driven by a lack of bias toward one side or the other, reflecting a state of maximum uncertainty or maximum entropy principle. Therefore, without additional information, assigning equal probabilities is considered a rational choice under these conditions.

$$
P(\text{Heads}) = P(\text{Tails}) = 0.5
$$

## How does Bayesian reasoning allow us to refine our knowledge about which side of the coin is which from coin flip results?

Bayesian reasoning involves updating our likelihood estimates based on new evidence. In this context, observing a sequence of coin flips allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of each side being heads. Initially, we might start with an equal belief (prior) that either side could be heads, but as we accumulate evidence (heads or tails results), our posterior probabilities adjust to reflect this new information, reducing our uncertainty about the identity of each side of the coin.

## Given the error rates of a medical cancer screening test, what are the terms for incorrect test results?

In the context of a medical screening test for cancer, the terms used for incorrect test results are "false positives" and "false negatives." A false positive occurs when the test incorrectly indicates that a person who does not have cancer does have it, with a given rate of $3\%$ in this example. A false negative happens when the test fails to detect cancer in a person who actually has it, with an error rate of $10\%$ reported.

$$
P(\text{False Positive}) = 0.03, \quad P(\text{False Negative}) = 0.10
$$
