## What does $N=60$ represent in the context of probability distributions as illustrated in Figure 2.5?

$N=60$ represents the total number of data points sampled from the joint distribution of variables $X$ and $Y$.

## Define and differentiate between marginal and conditional distributions as illustrated in Figure 2.5.

Marginal distribution looks at the probabilities of single variables irrespective of the others, as seen in $p(X)$ and $p(Y)$. The conditional distribution, such as $p(X \mid Y=1)$, shows the probabilities of variable $X$ given that $Y=1$.

## How can histograms serve as models for probability distributions in the context of Figure 2.5?

Histograms model probability distributions by showing the frequency of data points. As shown in Figure 2.5, histograms estimate $p(Y)$, $p(X)$, and $p(X \mid Y=1)$ by representing the empirical data distribution from a finite sample.

## Explain the implication of the statement that "the fractions would equal the corresponding probabilities $p(Y)$ in the limit when $N \rightarrow \infty$" as discussed in the exposition about histograms in Figure 2.5.

This statement underscores the concept of convergence in probability theory where, as the sample size $N$ increases to infinity, the fractions of occurrences of outcomes (measured by histograms) converge to their true probabilities in the underlying distribution.

## What is represented by $p(X \mid Y=1)$ and how is it estimated in Figure 2.5?

$p(X \mid Y=1)$ represents the conditional probability of $X$ given that $Y$ equals 1. It is estimated through a histogram that quantifies the fractions of $X$ among the data points where $Y=1$, as depicted in one of the plots in Figure 2.5.
