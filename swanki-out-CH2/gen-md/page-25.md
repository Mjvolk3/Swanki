## How does entropy measure the amount of information required to specify a state of a random variable in terms of bits?

Entropy quantifies the average information content needed to describe the state of a random variable. For a random variable $x$ with equally likely states, entropy calculates this as $$\mathrm{H}[x]=-8 \times \frac{1}{8} \log _{2} \frac{1}{8}=3 \text{ bits.}$$ This formula uses the logarithm base 2 (log base 2) because the information is measured in bits, and each equally likely state contributes equally to the total entropy.

## How does the entropy change when the distribution of states is non-uniform?

In contrast to uniform distributions, non-uniform distributions generally have lower entropy. When probabilities are unequal, higher probabilities contribute less to entropy due to the negative logarithm. Using the provided probability distribution $\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \frac{1}{64}, \frac{1/{64}, \frac{1}{64}, \frac{1}{64}\right)$, the entropy is calculated as $$\mathrm{H}[x]=-\left(\frac{1}{2} \log _{2} \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}/{4} \log _{2} \frac{1}/{4}+\cdots+\frac{4}/{64} \log _{2} \frac{1}/{64}\right)=2 \text{ bits.}$$ This lower entropy reflects the reduced uncertainty and information requirement due to the skewed distribution.

## Discuss the relationship between entropy and coding length in the context of the noiseless coding theorem.

The noiseless coding theorem, a fundamental principle in information theory devised by Shannon in 1948, asserts that the minimum average length of a code needed to transmit the state of a random variable without noise cannot be less than the entropy of the variable. For example, even when using an optimal coding scheme for nonuniform distributions, the average code length equals the entropy as shown: $$\text{average code length }=\frac{1}{2} \times 1+\frac{1}/{4} \times 2+\cdots+4 \times\frac{1}/{64} \times 6=2 \text{ bits,}$$ matching the entropy calculation.

## Why is the entropy sometimes calculated using natural logarithms, and what units result from this calculation?

Entropy is alternatively calculated using natural logarithms to ease mathematical manipulations especially when linking concepts across different scientific areas like physics and information theory. When using natural logarithms (ln), entropy is measured in nats (from 'natural logarithm'), where $1$ bit equals approximately $\ln(2)$ nats. This unit conversion allows deeper theoretical insights and connections in analyses involving entropy.

## Explore the historical context and dual interpretation of entropy in physics and information theory.

Historically, entropy was introduced in the realm of thermodynamics to describe heat dispersion and energy distribution within a system. It was later extended within statistical mechanics as a metric of disorder. This dual aspect of entropy, both as a physical property and as a measure of information amount, illustrates its interdisciplinary importanceâ€”highlighting entropy's role in understanding both concrete physical processes and abstract information distribution.
