## How does the discrete entropy formula $\mathrm{H}_{\Delta}$ relate with the differential entropy formula as $\Delta \rightarrow 0$?

The discrete entropy formula $\mathrm{H}_{\Delta}$ given by:

$$
\mathrm{H}_{\Delta} = -\sum_{i} p\left(x_{i}\right) \Delta \ln p\left(x_{i}\right)
$$

approaches the differential entropy formula:

$$
-\int p(x) \ln p(x) \mathrm{d} x
$$

as the discretization interval $\Delta$ approaches zero. This transition highlights that discrete and continuous entropy measures converge, differing by a divergent term $\ln \Delta$, which reflects the infinite precision needed to describe continuous variables.

## What is the significance of the omitted term $-\ln \Delta$ in the transformation of the entropy equation?

The term $-\ln \Delta$ in the entropy equation:

$$
\mathrm{H}_{\Delta}=-\sum_{i} p\left(x_{i}\right) \Delta \ln \left(p\left(x_{i}\right) \Delta\right)
$$

is omitted in further calculations because it is constant with respect to the probability distribution $p(x)$. Its removal simplifies the analysis without altering the dependency of entropy on the distribution, particularly as $\Delta \rightarrow 0$, where it emphasizes the infinite information content of specifying continuous variables precisely.

## How does the differential entropy $\mathrm{H}[\mathbf{x}]$ for a vector of continuous variables $\mathbf{x}$ get represented?

For a vector of continuous variables $\mathbf{x}$, the differential entropy is represented as:

$$
\mathrm{H}[\mathbf{x}] = -\int p(\mathbf{x}) \ln p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}
$$

This equation generalizes the concept of entropy to multidimensional continuous distributions, reflecting the average amount of information required to describe the state of $\mathbf{x}$ according to its probability density function $p(\mathbf{x})$.

## What conditions are established for maximizing the differential entropy of a continuous variable $p(x)$?

To maximize the differential entropy for a continuous variable $p(x)$, it is necessary to satisfy three conditions:

1. Normalization:
   $$
   \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \mathrm{d} x = 1
   $$
2. Expected value:
   $$
   \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x p(x) \mathrm{d} x = \mu
   $$
3. Variance:
   $$
   \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x - \mu)^2 p(x) \mathrm{d} x = \sigma^2
   $$

These constraints ensure the distribution $p(x)$ is well-defined with specified mean and variance, crucial for realistic modeling of continuous variables.

## Describe the application of Lagrange multipliers in maximizing the functional for entropy under constraints.

The application of Lagrange multipliers in maximizing the entropy functional of a continuous variable $p(x)$ under constraints involves defining a Lagrangian:

$$
-\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \ln p(x) \mathrm{d} x + \lambda_1 \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \mathrm{d} x - 1\right) + \lambda_2 \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x p(x) \mathrm{d} x - \mu\right) + \lambda_3 \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x - \mu)^2 p(x) \mathrm{d} x - \sigma^2\right)
$$

This leads to deriving the equations by setting the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to $p(x)$ to zero, thereby enforcing the constraints of normalization, mean, and variance while maximizing entropy. This method provides a systematic approach to finding the probability distribution that admits maximum entropy under specified conditions.
