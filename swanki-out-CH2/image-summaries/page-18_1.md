ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows three separate graphs, each representing a different dataset consisting of two data points (indicated by the green dots). For each graph, there are two Gaussian distributions depicted: the true Gaussian distribution (in red) and the Gaussian distribution obtained by maximum likelihood fitting to the observed data points (in blue).

The vertical dashed lines indicate the true mean (µ) of the data-generating process. The red curves represent the true Gaussian distribution centered at this mean with variance σ² (although the variance itself is not explicitly shown in the image). The blue curves represent the maximum likelihood estimate of the Gaussian distribution based on the limited data points provided by the green dots. The peaks of the blue curves correspond to the sample mean (µ_ML) of the respective datasets. It's clear that the blue curves have smaller variances than the red one, which reflects the underestimation of the variance by the maximum likelihood estimator, a concept explained in the provided text.

This image illustrates the concept of bias in the context of maximum likelihood estimation, specifically how using the maximum likelihood estimator for the mean does not introduce bias (as the expectation of the mean matches the true mean), but using it for the variance underestimates the true variance of the distribution. It provides a visual representation of the bias concept described in the section titled "2.3.3 Bias of maximum likelihood" in the context of a univariate Gaussian distribution.
