ChatGPT figure/image summary: In the image, you see a graphical representation of the likelihood function for a Gaussian (normal) distribution, depicted by the red curve. The grey points along the horizontal axis represent a dataset of values \(\{x_n\}\), and the blue points on the curve directly above these grey points show the corresponding values of the probability density function \(p(x)\) for the Gaussian distribution with parameters \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^2\). The green vertical lines connect the dataset points (grey) with their respective probability density function values (blue). The notation \(N(x_n | \mu, \sigma^2)\) indicates that the blue points are obtained from the Gaussian density function with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^2\) evaluated at points \(x_n\). Maximizing the likelihood function involves adjusting the mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^2\) of the Gaussian distribution so that the product of the probabilities corresponding to the observed data points is maximized.
