ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image appears to correspond to Figure 2.1(b) based on the description you provided. It shows a plot of 100 data points where the horizontal axis represents the variable \( x_1 \), and the vertical axis is labeled "y," which likely signifies the measured output or target variable. In this scenario, \( x_2 \) is unobserved, and as a result, the plot shows high levels of noise in the data due to the lack of information about \( x_2 \). This visualization reflects a two-dimensional regression problem reduced to one dimension due to the unobserved variable, which leads to a greater spread in the data points along the vertical axis.
