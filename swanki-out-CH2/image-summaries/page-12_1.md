ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a graph showing three probability density functions plotted against a variable \( x \). Each function is represented by a different color:

1. The red plot represents a uniform distribution over the range \((-1, 1)\). It is constant within this interval and zero elsewhere. The height is such that the area under the curve within the interval adds up to 1, indicating a properly normalized probability distribution.

2. The blue plot represents an exponential distribution with parameter \(\lambda = 1\). The graph shows a positive exponential decrease starting from the y-axis and decaying as \( x \) increases. It starts at \( x = 0 \) and continues towards positive infinity.

3. The green plot represents a Laplace distribution with parameters \(\mu = 1\) and \(\gamma = 1\). It features a peak at the value of \( x \) corresponding to the mean \(\mu\), and the graph is symmetric on both sides of this peak, showing exponential decay towards both directions from \(\mu\).

The x-axis is labeled with \( x \), and the y-axis is labeled with \( p(x) \), indicating probability density. This graph is a visual representation of the probability densities described in the text preceding this figure, demonstrating different functional forms of simple probability distributions.
