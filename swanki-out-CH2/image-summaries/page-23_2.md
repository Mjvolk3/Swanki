ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts a visual illustration of how a two-dimensional grid transformation occurs. It demonstrates the effect of a nonlinear variable change on the grid lines that represent the probability distribution in two dimensions. 

In the upper part of the image, you see a regularly spaced grid pattern in a space designated by \(x_1\) and \(x_2\). This can be understood as the original coordinate system where the variables are uniformly spaced and follow a standard Cartesian grid.

Below the arrow, the grid has been transformed into a new space, designated by \(y_1\) and \(y_2\). The effect of the transformation is seen as a distortion of the grid lines, which now appear as curved and varying in spacing. This grid deformation visually represents the change of variables from \(x\) space to \(y\) space following a nonlinear transformation.

This diagram is likely illustrating the conceptual change of variables in a probability distribution, analogous to the transformation described in the text you provided. It visually explains how a simple, regular distribution over \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) would look quite different when transformed into the \(y\) coordinate system due to the nonlinear relationship between the two. The distortion of the grid lines suggests that the transformation has expanded certain regions and contracted others, which would impact the density of the distribution and the position of its mode, consistent with the nonlinear change of variables concept described earlier.
