ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a plot of a mathematical function and data points, which is related to the topic of regression analysis, a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables. The red curve represents a true function, denoted as \( y(x, w) \), which is a mathematical model to fit the data points. The blue dots are data points that are generated by adding Gaussian noise to the true function \( y(x, w) \), simulating observed data in an experiment or a study.

The blue curve represents a Gaussian distribution centered on the vertical line at \( x_0 \), indicating the distribution of the target variable \( t \) given the input variable \( x \), shown as \( p(t | x_0, w, \sigma^2) \). This curve reflects the probability distribution for the outcome variable \( t \) for a given \( x \) value (in this case \( x_0 \)), where \( \sigma^2 \) denotes the variance of the Gaussian distribution. Hence, the image demonstrates the concept of conditional probability distribution in a regression context, where the goal is to predict the target variable \( t \) given a new input \( x \) based on a learned model.
