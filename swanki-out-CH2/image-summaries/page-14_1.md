ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a plot of the Gaussian (normal) distribution for a single continuous variable \( x \). This function is illustrated with a bell-shaped curve that is symmetrical around the mean \( \mu \). The graph is labeled with \( \mathcal{N}(x|\mu,\sigma^2) \) on the y-axis, indicating that this is the probability density of \( x \). The x-axis represents the variable \( x \), with a point marked as \( \mu \), identifying the mean of the distribution. There is also a horizontal two-headed arrow spanning the width labeled as \( 2\sigma \), which indicates that this length represents two standard deviations from the mean (one to the left and one to the right), illustrating the region where approximately 95% of the values lie if the data is normally distributed.
