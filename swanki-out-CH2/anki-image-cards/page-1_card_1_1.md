Epistemic uncertainty is derived from the Greek word 'episteme', meaning knowledge, and is sometimes referred to as systematic uncertainty. This type of uncertainty relates to what is not known about a model or a theory, and is reducible in nature.

The information in the image primarily relates to the concept of probabilities, especially regarding how uncertainties are addressed in machine learning applications. This includes socio-technical systems that must operate under inherent uncertainties, such as in medical diagnosis from image classification where complete accuracy is practically unachievable.
