The image shows a scatter plot representing 100 data points where the variable \( x_2 \) is unobserved, indicating high levels of noise. Theoretically, this plot exemplifies how the absence of certain dimensions (in this case, \( x_2 \)) can lead to a misleading representation of data. The underlying function of the data is \( y(x_1, x_2) = \sin(2\pi x_1) \sin(2\pi x_2) \), but the unobserved \( x_2 \) causes the plot to only superficially represent \( x_1 \), obscuring the true bivariate relationship.

## Analyze the effect of unobserved variables in a scatter plot as demonstrated by the given image.

The image, part of a two-dimensional sine curve regression problem, reveals the effect of unobserved variables on data representation. In theory, when a key variable like \( x_2 \) in the function \( y(x_1, x_2) = \sin(2\pi x_1) \sin(2\pi x_2) \) is not visualized or accounted for, the resulting plot demonstrates increased dispersion and noise. This is evident as the points are scattered widely, making the underlying sinusoidal pattern related to \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) difficult to discern. It underscores the complexity and potential misinterpretation in analyzing datasets where not all variables are observed, critical in fields like statistical data analysis and machine learning.
