The plot in the top left quadrant is a scatter plot representing a joint probability distribution \(p(X, Y)\) of two random variables, \(X\) and \(Y\), where \(X\) takes nine possible values and \(Y\) takes two possible values. The \(X\) values are distributed across nine columns, and the \(Y\) values across two rows, with each data point illustrated as a blue dot.

## In the bottom right quadrant, what is the specific type of distribution depicted, and how is it derived from the data in the top left plot?

The bottom right quadrant of the image depicts the conditional probability distribution \(p(X \mid Y=1)\), showing the likelihood of various \(X\) values given that \(Y=1\). This conditional distribution is derived from the scatter plot in the top left quadrant by considering only the data points along the bottom row where \(Y=1\) and ignoring the points where \(Y=2\).
