The red curve in the image represents the likelihood function for a Gaussian distribution. The grey points along the horizontal axis represent a dataset of values $\{x_n\}$, and the blue points, located directly on the likelihood curve above these grey points, show the calculated values of the probability density function $p(x)$ of a Gaussian distribution evaluated at these points. The purpose of these points is to visualize the probability contributions of individual data points to the total likelihood, which is maximized during parameter estimation.

## How do you compute the likelihood function for a Gaussian distributed data set as shown in the image, and what is its practical implication?

The likelihood function for a Gaussian distributed data set $\mathbf{x}$ is computed as:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right)=\prod_{n=1}^{N} \mathcal{N}\left(x_{n} \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right)
$$

where $\mathcal{N}\left(x_{n} \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right)$ represents the value of the Gaussian probability density function at each data point $x_n$, given parameters mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. The practical implication of this function is that it enables the estimation of these parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ by maximizing the likelihood function, thereby fitting the Gaussian model as closely as possible to the observed data.
