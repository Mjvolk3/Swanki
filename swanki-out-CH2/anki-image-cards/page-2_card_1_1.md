The function plotted is $y(x_1, x_2) = \sin(2\pi x_1) \sin(2\pi x_2)$. Data is generated by selecting values for $x_1$ and $x_2$, computing $y(x_1, x_2)$, and then adding Gaussian noise.

## How does the plot (b) differ from plot (a) in Figure 2.1 and what does it represent?

Plot (b) represents 100 data points where the variable $x_2$ is unobserved, evidenced by high levels of noise in the data compared to plot (a), which is a clear three-dimensional representation of the function $y(x_1, x_2) = \sin(2\pi x_1) \sin(2\pi x_2)$. Plot (b) illustrates how the absence of one variable can impact data representation and noise levels.
