The image of a bent coin is used to depict two distinct views of probability: the frequency of repeatable events and the quantification of uncertainty in non-repeatable situations. As the text discusses, even without knowing which side of the bent coin is heads or tails, we assume a 50% probability for landing on either side when betting, highlighting probability's role in managing uncertainty in undeterminable circumstances.

## What is the rational choice for predicting the outcome of a coin flip with the bent coin as per the associated text, and why?

According to the associated text, the rational choice for predicting the outcome of flipping the bent coin, absent any further information, is to assume a probability of 0.5 for either heads or tails. This is due to the principle of symmetry and the incapability to distinguish the convex side's identity, demonstrating a more general use of probability as management of uncertainty rather than the mere frequency of events.
