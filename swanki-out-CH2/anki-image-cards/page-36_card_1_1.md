These are non-transitive dice, specifically Efron dice, which exhibit the property that each die in the cycle (orange, red, blue, green) has a $2/3$ probability of rolling a higher number than the next die in the cycle. This contradicts the usual transitive properties of conventional dice, providing insight into probability and game theory.

## Explain the probability dynamics within this cycle of Efron dice.

In each matchup within the cycle of Efron dice (orange vs. red, red vs. blue, blue vs. green, green vs. orange), the probability that the former beats the latter is $2/3$. This arrangement illustrates non-transitivity, as despite individual matchups favoring the former dice, the cycle does not imply a uniform superiority, breaking conventional transitive expectations.
