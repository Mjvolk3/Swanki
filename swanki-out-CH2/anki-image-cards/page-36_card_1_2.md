Non-transitive dice, such as the Efron dice depicted in the image, are a set of dice that do not follow the traditional transitive property. In this case, each die is expected to roll a higher number than the previous die in their arrangement cycle with a probability of $2/3$. The specific design shown includes four dice arranged in a cycle: an orange die with all six faces showing the number 3, a red die with faces showing the numbers 2 and 6, a blue die with faces of 4 and 0, and a green die displaying numbers 5 and 1. This arrangement ensures that each die beats the previous one in the cycle two-thirds of the time, illustrating the concept of non-transitivity.

## How can you demonstrate the non-transitive properties of the Efron dice using the numbers provided on each die from the image?

To illustrate the non-transitive properties of the Efron dice using the numbers provided:
1. Orange die (all 3's) versus Red die (three 2's and three 6's): The orange die wins against the 2's and loses against the 6's, resulting in a 1/2 probability of winning.
2. Red die versus Blue die (three 4's and three 0's): Red wins over all three 0's and half of the 4's, giving a winning probability greater than 1/2.
3. Blue die versus Green die (three 5's and three 1's): Blue wins against all three 1's and draws against the 5's, resulting in a winning probability greater than 1/2.
4. Green die versus Orange die: Green wins over all the 3's, showing a winning probability of 1.

These examples show that, although there might be instances where a die might seem stronger or weaker, the cycle doesn't maintain a consistent order of dominance as each die can potentially win over the next, thereby showcasing their non-transitive nature.
