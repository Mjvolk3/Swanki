## How does the physical distortion of a coin, as shown in the image, affect our understanding of probability in terms of a repeatable event and quantification of uncertainty?

In the context of the bent coin shown, probability transcends the classical frequency interpretation of repeatable events (like a fair coin toss resulting in heads or tails). Instead, due to its distortion, it serves as a model for understanding probability as a broader quantification of uncertainty. This embodies the Bayesian perspective where probabilities reflect degrees of belief or uncertainty about events, rather than just long-run frequencies. For instance, without additional information, we suppose a 0.5 likelihood for each outcome (heads or tails), emphasizing uncertainty rather than deterministic predictability.

## Using the bent coin scenario described, how can you interpret the symmetry assumption in probability, especially when lacking precise information about an event?

Symmetry in probability, particularly evident in the bent coin scenario, assists in decision-making under uncertainty. Given that the identities of heads and tails are unknown and equivalent in absence of distinguishing markers, symmetry is assumed where each outcome (heads or tails) has an equal probability of occurring (0.5). This assumption simplifies the bet to a rational choice even when details are absent or obscured, reflecting probability use beyond mere event frequency to encompass general uncertainty management.
