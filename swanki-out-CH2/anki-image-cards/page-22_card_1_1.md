The green curve \( p_x(g(y)) \) in Figure 2.12 represents the transformation of the density \( p_x(x) \) as a function of \( y \) using the function \( g^{-1} \), such that the mode of \( p_x(x) \) is transformed via the sigmoid function to the mode of the green curve. However, this transformation does not account for the change of variables' effect on the density, specifically it omits the Jacobian determinant which adjusts for the change in volume element in \( y \) space, resulting in a different appearance from the actual transformed density \( p_y(y) \), shown in magenta.

## How does the magenta curve \( p_y(y) \) differ from the green curve \( p_x(g(y)) \) in Figure 2.12, and what mathematical concept causes this difference?

The magenta curve \( p_y(y) \) differs from the green curve \( p_x(g(y)) \) in that it properly accounts for the effect of the change of variables on the density function. This difference is caused by the inclusion of the Jacobian determinant factor in the transformation, which adjusts the density to compensate for how the transformation stretches or compresses the volume elements in the transformed space. The Jacobian determinant is a critical element in probability transformations as it adjusts the transformed density to ensure that the total probability mass remains constant. As a result, while the green curve directly transforms the density without this adjustment, leading to a different, unadjusted mode location and density shape, the magenta curve reflects the correct transformation, resulting in a shifted mode and modified shape relative to the green curve.
