When using maximum likelihood estimation to determine variance based on limited data points, the variance is systematically underestimated. This phenomenon is depicted by the narrower blue curves in the image, which show Gaussian distributions fitted to limited data (green dots), as opposed to the broader red curve representing the true Gaussian distribution. The underestimation occurs because the variance is measured relative to the sample mean rather than the true mean of the distribution.

## What does the image illustrate about the bias introduced by maximum likelihood estimation in estimating the parameters of a Gaussian distribution?

The image illustrates that while the maximum likelihood estimation for the mean of a Gaussian distribution (indicated by the alignment of the peaks of the blue and red curves at the true mean) does not introduce bias, the estimation of the variance does. Specifically, the blue curves, representing the variance estimated via maximum likelihood from just two data points (green dots), are noticeably narrower than the red curve, which illustrates the true variance. This visual representation helps explain the systematic underestimation of variance by maximum likelihood estimation, a key concern highlighted in statistical estimation theory.
