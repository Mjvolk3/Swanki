## How does the probability of a continuous variable \( x \) lying in the interval \((x, x+\delta x)\) relate to the probability density function \( p(x) \)?

The probability of a continuous variable \( x \) lying in the interval \((x, x+\delta x)\) is approximated by the area under the probability density function \( p(x) \) over that interval, specifically \( p(x) \delta x \) as \( \delta x \rightarrow 0 \).

## How is the relationship between the probability density function \( p(x) \) and the cumulative distribution function \( P(x) \) graphically illustrated in the image?

The image shows the probability density function \( p(x) \) as a blue curve and the cumulative distribution function \( P(x) \) as a red curve. The \( P(x) \) curve is monotonically increasing, representing the accumulation of probabilities from \( p(x) \), which effectively makes \( P(x) \) the integral of \( p(x) \) from \(-\infty\) to \( x \). The area under the curve of \( p(x) \) within an infinitesimally small interval \( \delta x \) approximates the increment in \( P(x) \) at \( x \).
