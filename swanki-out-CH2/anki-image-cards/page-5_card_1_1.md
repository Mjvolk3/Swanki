In the context of the probability distribution table, \( p(X=x_i) \) represents the marginal probability of the random variable \( X \) taking the value \( x_i \). It is calculated by summing the joint probabilities of \( X=x_i \) with all possible values of \( Y \), which is mathematically expressed as:

$$
p(X=x_i) = \sum_{j=1}^{M} p(X=x_i, Y=y_j)
$$

This calculation utilizes the sum rule of probability which says that the probability of an event is the sum of the joint probabilities over the other variable. In practical terms, you add up all the probabilities in the column corresponding to \(x_i\) in the table.

## Based on the conditional probability \( p(Y=y_j \mid X=x_i) \), how is it defined in the context of the image and associated text?

The conditional probability \( p(Y=y_j \mid X=x_i) \) is defined in the context as the probability of \( Y \) taking value \( y_j \) given that \( X \) has taken value \( x_i \). It is calculated using the formula:

$$
p(Y=y_j \mid X=x_i) = \frac{n_{ij}}{c_i}
$$

where \( n_{ij} \) is the number of instances where \( X=x_i \) and \( Y=y_j \) and \( c_i \) is the total number of instances where \( X=x_i \), across all values of \( Y \). This formula is a direct application of the definition of conditional probability which relates the joint probability of two events and the marginal probability of the conditioning event.
