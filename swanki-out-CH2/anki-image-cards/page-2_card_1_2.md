The function represented in the three-dimensional plot is $$y(x_1, x_2) = \sin(2\pi x_1) \sin(2\pi x_2).$$ This function illustrates a two-variable sinusoidal pattern that repeats regularly along both $x_1$ and $x_2$ axes.

Analyzing the surface plot depicted, the sinusoidal pattern along both $x_1$ and $x_2$ axes suggests a product of two sine functions, each dependent on a different variable. This arrangement creates peaks and troughs, where the product is maximized at multiple points over the domain of the function, corresponding to $(n\pi, m\pi)$ for $n, m \in \mathbb{Z}$. The zero points occur wherever either sine term equals zero, determined by $x_1 = \frac{k}{2}$ or $x_2 = \frac{j}{2}$ for $k, j \in \mathbb{Z}$. The regular repetition of the pattern confirms the periodic nature of both contributing sine functions.
