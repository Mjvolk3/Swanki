The bent coin in the image symbolizes the conceptual difference between viewing probability as a frequency of repeatable events and as a quantification of the uncertainty of individual outcomes. This distinction is crucial in Bayesian probability theory where probabilities also reflect our state of knowledge or belief about unknown events.

## How does Bayesian probability approach the problem of determining the outcome of flipping a bent coin with unknown sidedness, and how does it contrast with the frequentist perspective?

Bayesian probability would suggest that in the absence of further information, one should assign equal probabilities to the outcomes of the bent coin landing heads or tails, reflecting symmetry and prior beliefs (i.e., $0.5$ for each outcome). This contrasts with the frequentist approach, which relies strictly on long-term frequency data of repeatable eventsâ€”which is not applicable in this case as the "sidedness" of the bent coin is defined as unknown and non-repeatable.
