The nonlinear transformation applied to a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution, as shown in Figure 2.13, results in a more complex, multimodal distribution. The transformation distorts the previously radially symmetric, single-mode Gaussian distribution into a probability distribution with multiple modes and varying densities.

## How does the nonlinear change of variables shown in Figure 2.13 affect the spatial distribution of probability samples?

The nonlinear change of variables, as illustrated in the bottom right part of Figure 2.13, affects the spatial distribution of the sampled points by dispersing them into more complex structures corresponding to the transformed distribution's heat map. Originally, the points gravitated toward the center, reflecting the Gaussian's high probability density; post-transformation, the spread and arrangement of points become more varied and asymmetric.
