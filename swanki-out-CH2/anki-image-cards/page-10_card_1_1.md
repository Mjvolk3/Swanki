## How is the probability of a continuous variable \( x \) being in the interval \( (x, x+\delta x) \) expressed in terms of probability density \( p(x) \)?

The probability of \( x \) lying within the interval \( (x, x+\delta x) \) is approximated by \( p(x) \delta x \) as \( \delta x \) approaches zero. This approximation is visually represented by the area under the probability density function \( p(x) \) over the interval \( \delta x \).

## Explain the relationship between the probability density function \( p(x) \) and the cumulative distribution function \( P(x) \).

The probability density function \( p(x) \) is related to the cumulative distribution function \( P(x) \) through differentiation. Specifically, \( p(x) \) is the derivative of \( P(x) \):

$$
p(x) = \frac{dP(x)}{dx}
$$

This derivative represents the rate of increase of the probability accumulated up to a point \( x \), expressing how densities of probabilities are distributed along the value of \( x \).
