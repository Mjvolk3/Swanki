The image demonstrates how using MLE for variance estimation in Gaussian distributions leads to systematic underestimation. When fitted to small samples (only two data points per dataset depicted by green dots), the estimated Gaussian distributions (blue curves) exhibit smaller variances compared to the true distribution (red curve). This occurs because the variance is calculated relative to the estimated mean (sample mean) rather than the true mean of the distribution, thus illustrating a fundamental bias of MLE in estimating variance.
