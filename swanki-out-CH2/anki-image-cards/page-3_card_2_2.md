## What does the bent coin in the image primarily illustrate about the concept of probability?

The bent coin illustrates the dual nature of probability as both a frequency associated with repeatable events and as a quantification of uncertainty in scenarios where outcomes are not immediately clear or repeatable, such as not knowing which side of the coin is heads or tails.

## If the convex side of a bent coin like the one in the image is either heads or tails, but you do not know which, how should you approach betting on its next flip?

In the absence of additional information about which side represents heads or tails, the rational approach is to assume that each outcome (heads or tails) has an equal probability of 0.5. This assumption is based on symmetry and is a pragmatic application of probability to manage uncertainty in a situation where the specific nature of the event is unknown.
