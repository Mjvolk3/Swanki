The schematic illustrates a feedback loop linking glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is converted into pyruvic acid (pyruvate), which in turn produces acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA then enters the citric acid cycle, releasing one molecule of CO₂ and converting NAD⁺ into NADH + H⁺. Excess acetyl-CoA inhibits pyruvate kinase, preventing further conversion of glucose into the glycolytic pathway, demonstrating a feedback regulation mechanism within cellular metabolism.

## What is the role of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in the feedback mechanism connecting glycolysis and the citric acid cycle?

Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) plays a critical role in the feedback mechanism by being converted into pyruvic acid in the final reaction of glycolysis. Pyruvic acid then leads to the production of acetyl-CoA, which, when accumulated in excess, inhibits pyruvate kinase. This inhibition prevents further conversion of glucose into the glycolytic pathway, thus regulating the metabolic process to ensure efficiency and balance.
