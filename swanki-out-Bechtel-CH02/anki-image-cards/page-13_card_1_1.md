The labeled parts of the heart in the diagram are:
- RA: Right Atrium
- LA: Left Atrium
- RV: Right Ventricle
- LV: Left Ventricle
- T: Tricuspid Valve
- M: Mitral Valve
- P: Pulmonary Valve
- A: Aortic Valve

These labels indicate the key structures involved in the heart's function as a blood-pumping mechanism.

The flow of blood through the heart, as indicated in the diagram, follows these steps:
1. Oxygen-poor blood returns from the tissues via the vena cava into the right atrium (RA).
2. Blood flows from the RA through the tricuspid valve (T) into the right ventricle (RV).
3. The RV pumps the blood through the pulmonary valve (P) into the pulmonary artery, sending it to the lungs for oxygenation.
4. Oxygen-rich blood returns from the lungs via the pulmonary vein into the left atrium (LA).
5. Blood flows from the LA through the mitral valve (M) into the left ventricle (LV).
6. The LV pumps the oxygen-rich blood through the aortic valve (A) into the aorta, distributing it to the rest of the body.
