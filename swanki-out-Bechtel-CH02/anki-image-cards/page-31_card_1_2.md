The governor mechanism designed by James Watt functions as a negative feedback control system to maintain a constant speed in a steam engine. The mechanism includes an upright spindle connected to a flywheel. Attached to this spindle are arms with balls at their ends, which move outward due to centrifugal force as the flywheel speeds up. The position of these arms is linked to a valve. When the engine runs faster, the arms rise, closing the valve and reducing steam flow, which slows down the engine. Conversely, when the engine speed decreases, the arms fall, opening the valve to increase steam flow and speed up the engine. This ensures the engine operates at a steady speed despite changes in load conditions.

## What is the primary function of the balls (labelled as "E" in the drawing) in James Watt's governor mechanism for his steam engine?

The primary function of the balls in James Watt's governor mechanism is to detect changes in the speed of the flywheel by moving outward or inward due to centrifugal force. As the engine speed increases, the balls move outward, and as the engine speed decreases, they move inward. These movements are part of the negative feedback control system which adjusts the valve position to regulate the engine speed by altering the steam flow.
