Blood flow through the heart follows this path:
1. Oxygen-poor blood returns from the body via the vena cava to the Right Atrium (RA).
2. Blood moves from RA through the Tricuspid Valve (T) into the Right Ventricle (RV).
3. Blood is then pumped from the RV through the Pulmonary Valve (P) to the lungs via the pulmonary artery.
4. Oxygen-rich blood returns from the lungs to the Left Atrium (LA) via the pulmonary vein.
5. Blood travels from LA through the Mitral Valve (M) into the Left Ventricle (LV).
6. Finally, blood is pumped from the LV through the Aortic Valve (A) into the aorta to be distributed throughout the body.

## What roles do the valves play in the heart as depicted in the diagram, and where are they located?

The valves in the heart ensure one-way blood flow and prevent backflow. Their locations and roles are:
1. **Tricuspid Valve (T)**: Located between the Right Atrium (RA) and Right Ventricle (RV), it controls blood flow from RA to RV.
2. **Pulmonary Valve (P)**: Located between the Right Ventricle (RV) and the pulmonary artery, it controls blood flow from RV to the lungs.
3. **Mitral Valve (M)**: Located between the Left Atrium (LA) and Left Ventricle (LV), it controls blood flow from LA to LV.
4. **Aortic Valve (A)**: Located between the Left Ventricle (LV) and the aorta, it controls blood flow from LV to the rest of the body.
