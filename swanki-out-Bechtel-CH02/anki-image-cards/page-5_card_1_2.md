Descartes' representation of nerve transmission in reflex action involves "animal spirits" traveling through nerves. In the illustration, a person bends over a fire. The heat (stimulus) is sensed by the skin, and the sensory information travels along nerve pathways (A and B) to the brain. The brain then sends a signal back through the nerves, resulting in a reflexive action such as moving the hand away. This model was an early attempt to explain how sensory input can result in motor responses, laying groundwork for our understanding of neural processes.

Descartes used the theoretical concept of "animal spirits" in his model for nerve transmission during reflex actions. These "animal spirits" were thought to flow through the nerves from sense organs to the brain and then back to the muscles, facilitating motion. This concept was a precursor to our modern understanding of the nervous system and neural communication.
