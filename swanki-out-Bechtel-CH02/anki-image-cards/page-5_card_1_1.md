Descartes' representation explains that sensory information travels from the sense organs to the brain via "animal spirits" and then back to the muscles, resulting in motion. This forms an early conceptual model for reflex actions.

## What are "animal spirits" as depicted by Descartes in his illustration of nerve transmission?

"Animal spirits" in Descartes' illustration refer to a hypothesized fluid that travels through the nerves from the sense organs to the brain and then back to the muscles to cause motion. This was an early attempt to explain nerve function and reflexes.
