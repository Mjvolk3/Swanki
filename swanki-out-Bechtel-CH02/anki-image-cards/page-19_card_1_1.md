The schematic representation shows the linkage between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Phosphoenolpyruvate is converted into pyruvic acid, which in turn produces acetyl-CoA. This conversion releases CO₂ and reduces NAD⁺ to NADH + H⁺. The feedback loop indicates that the accumulation of acetyl-CoA inhibits pyruvate kinase, thus regulating the metabolic pathway.

## How does the feedback mechanism involving acetyl-CoA operate within glycolysis?

The feedback mechanism operates by the accumulation of acetyl-CoA, which inhibits the enzyme pyruvate kinase. This inhibition prevents the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvic acid, thereby regulating the glycolytic pathway and preventing excessive production of acetyl-CoA when it is produced faster than it can be used in the citric acid cycle.
