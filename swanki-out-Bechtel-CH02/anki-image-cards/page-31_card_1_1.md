The governor mechanism designed by James Watt is intended to maintain a constant speed in the steam engine by using a negative feedback control system. When the engine speed increases, the centrifugal force causes the arms with the balls to move outward, which in turn closes the valve and reduces steam flow, slowing down the engine. Conversely, when the engine speed decreases, the balls move inward, opening the valve and increasing steam flow, speeding up the engine to maintain a steady speed.

## How does the governor mechanism in James Watt's steam engine utilize centrifugal force to regulate engine speed?

The governor mechanism utilizes centrifugal force to regulate engine speed by having arms with balls connected to an upright spindle attached to the flywheel. As the flywheel turns faster, the centrifugal force causes the arms and balls to move outward. This outward movement is linked to a valve that reduces steam flow, thus slowing the engine down. When the engine slows and the flywheel turns slower, the arms move inward, opening the valve to increase steam flow and speed up the engine.
