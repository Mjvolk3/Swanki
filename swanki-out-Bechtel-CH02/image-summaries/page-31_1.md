ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts a schematic drawing of the governor mechanism designed by James Watt for his steam engine. It features an upright spindle attached to a flywheel at the bottom. There are arms connected to this spindle that have balls (labelled as "E" in the drawing) at their ends. As the flywheel turns, the centrifugal force will cause these arms with balls to move outward if the engine speed increases. Conversely, they will move inward if the engine speed decreases.

The position of the arms is connected to a valve via a linkage mechanism. This mechanism ensures that when the balls move further out (indicating higher engine speeds), the valve closes, reducing steam flow and therefore slowing the engine down. When the balls move closer in (indicating slower engine speeds), the valve opens, increasing steam flow and speeding up the engine.

This governor mechanism is a classic example of a negative feedback control system designed to maintain a constant speed in the steam engine, regardless of varying load conditions. The faster the engine runs, the more the arms rise, causing the valve to close and vice versa, ensuring the engine operates at the desired steady speed.
