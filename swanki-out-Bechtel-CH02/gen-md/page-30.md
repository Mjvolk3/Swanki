## Describe James Clerk Maxwell's contribution to control systems using differential equations.

James Clerk Maxwell's 1868 mathematical analysis of control systems introduced the use of differential equations to describe and analyze the behavior of control systems. He focused on maintaining the constant speed of a steam engine despite varying loads.

## Explain the mechanism behind Watt's governor used in steam engines.

Watt connected moveable arms to a spindle attached to the drive shaft. The centrifugal force caused the arms to open with increasing engine speed. These arms were linked to a steam valve to regulate the engine's speed: closing the valve when the arms rose (to slow down) and opening the valve when the arms dropped (to speed up).

## What was Norbert Wiener's contribution to control systems during World War II?

Norbert Wiener, alongside Julian Bigelow, developed a control system for antiaircraft fire. They used radar information to predict the future location of an airplane and corrected predictions based on errors in the next timestep, inspired by the cyclic organization observed in biology. However, they had to use averaging techniques to avoid uncontrollable oscillations due to noisy feedback signals.

## How did Wiener and Bigelow's antiaircraft control system relate to biological systems?

Wiener and Bigelow's control system drew inspiration from biological systems' feedback mechanisms. They faced similar challenges in predicting and correcting positions, analogous to limb movement in animals. Both required damping techniques to control oscillations due to noisy feedback.
