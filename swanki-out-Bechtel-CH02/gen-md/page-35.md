Explain Fodorâ€™s condition regarding hypothesis formation and confirmation and discuss why it is contentious.

## Back of Card

Fodor's condition states that learning consists of hypothesis formation and confirmation. This assumption is contentious because it presupposes a specific cognitive model, which may not be universally applicable. Opponents argue that alternative models, such as self-organizing systems, could provide a more accurate representation of cognitive processes. Self-organizing systems are capable of constructing richer structures from simpler beginnings, thereby potentially offering an alternative framework for understanding learning and cognitive development.

Describe the concept of adaptive landscapes and how it relates to current modes of organization in artifacts versus biological systems.

## Back of Card

Adaptive landscapes represent a metaphor for the fitness of different phenotypes in a population. In artifacts, current modes of organization are usually near local peaks on adaptive landscapes, meaning that small variations are likely detrimental. Biological systems, however, can employ self-organization and self-reorganization to explore new peaks beyond local optima. This ability allows biological systems to generate new components and activities from within, contrasting with artifacts that depend on external engineers for new forms of organization.

Discuss the concept of self-organization in nervous systems and provide examples illustrating this phenomenon.

## Back of Card

Self-organization in nervous systems refers to the capacity of neural tissues to adapt and reconfigure based on experience and input. Examples include:

1. Tissue intended for visual processing tasks adapting to process auditory inputs in the absence of visual stimuli (Pascual-Leone \& Hamilton, 2001).
2. Reorganization of somatosensory cortex areas when input changes, such as when digits are bound together, causing the cortex to cease processing them differentially (Merzenich et al., 1990).

These examples highlight the plasticity and adaptability inherent in nervous systems, enabling them to form and reform functional structures autonomously.

## Front of Card

Explain the role of natural selection in the retention of biological system organization and how this differs from artificial systems relying on engineers.

## Back of Card

Natural selection plays a vital role in the retention and propagation of advantageous organizational traits in biological systems. Unlike artificial systems that rely on engineers to impose new organizational structures, biological systems evolve through selective retention of beneficial mutations and variations. This process allows them to adapt to changing environments autonomously. While new useful modes of organization through chance variation are rare, self-organizing systems in biology can generate new components with novel capacities, enhancing their adaptability and functionality.
