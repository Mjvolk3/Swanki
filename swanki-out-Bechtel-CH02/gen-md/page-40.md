## Describe one method researchers use to understand the internal operations of a biological mechanism.

Researchers attempt to isolate from cells what they take to be the relevant enzymes and cofactors for a given reaction and then conduct experiments on the isolated components. This method helps in understanding the role and function of specific components within the overall mechanism.

## What are the two main strategies for determining whether and how components figure in a mechanism?

Two main strategies for determining whether and how components figure in a mechanism are excitation and inhibition. Excitation involves stimulating a component to observe its effect on the mechanism, while inhibition involves removing or deactivating a component to observe the resulting changes in the mechanism's behavior.

## According to the text, why might the removal of a component part in a mechanism produce a complex cascade of effects?

According to the text, the removal of a component part in a mechanism might produce a complex cascade of effects because the system is forced to operate without the missing part, leading to altered behavior that can disrupt other related functions. This cascade can make it challenging to decipher the exact role of the component, as the damage may impact parts indirectly related to the primary output being observed.

## What does Richard Gregory argue about the complexity of identifying causal connections in mechanisms?

Richard Gregory argues that, although the effects of a particular type of ablation may be specific and repeatable, the causal connection is not straightforward. The affected region might not be directly functionally important for the observed output like memory or speech, but the damage could disrupt other parts of the mechanism that indirectly affect the outcome.
