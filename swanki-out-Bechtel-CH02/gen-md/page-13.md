## Describe the key differences between structural and functional decomposition mentioned in the text, and their significance in scientific research.

Structural decomposition involves breaking down a mechanism into its component parts, such as determining that the heart comprises the right atrium (RA), left atrium (LA), right ventricle (RV), and left ventricle (LV). Functional decomposition, on the other hand, breaks down the mechanism into its operations, such as understanding how the heart pumps blood through opening and closing of valves: tricuspid valve (T), mitral valve (M), pulmonary valve (P), and aortic valve (A). The significance in scientific research lies in that these decompositions often proceed independently and may even be pursued by scientists from different fields using different tools.

## What are the labeled parts in the figure of the heart mechanism and their functions?

The labeled parts in the heart mechanism are:
- RA: right atrium, which receives deoxygenated blood.
- LA: left atrium, which receives oxygenated blood.
- RV: right ventricle, which pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs.
- LV: left ventricle, which pumps oxygenated blood to the body.
- T: tricuspid valve, which prevents backflow into the right atrium.
- M: mitral valve, which prevents backflow into the left atrium.
- P: pulmonary valve, which prevents backflow from the pulmonary artery.
- A: aortic valve, which prevents backflow from the aorta.

## What are two examples of structural decomposition provided in the text?

1. Anatomical dissection has shown that the heart is composed of four chambers (RA, LA, RV, LV) and at least four valves (T, M, P, A).
2. Microscopy revealed that tissues are composed of cells, which contain a plasma membrane, nucleus, and cytoplasm.

## What does the term "self-regulating mechanism" refer to in the text?

A self-regulating mechanism refers to a system where the operations or functions both affect and are affected by the parts on which they operate, providing feedback that helps the mechanism regulate itself. For example, in the cardiovascular system, hormonal feedback mechanisms regulate heart rate and blood pressure to maintain homeostasis.
