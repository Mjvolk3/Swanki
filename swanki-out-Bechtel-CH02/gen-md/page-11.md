## What was discovered by early investigators about fermentation and what was later revised?

Early investigators construed fermentation as a catabolic activity breaking down sugar and yielding alcohol (with heat as a by-product). Later, it was recognized that the energy released during fermentation was captured in high-energy phosphate bonds used as energy sources for other cell activities. This expanded the understanding of fermentation from merely breaking down sugar to converting the energy of foodstuffs into a form useful for cell activities like cell division.

## According to the paper, what is the first step in providing explanations, including mechanistic explanations?

The project of providing explanations begins with the identification of a phenomenon. This identification determines what will count as relevant parts, operations, and their organization in the development of a mechanistic explanation. If some entity's operation does not contribute to the production of a given phenomenon, it is not considered part of the mechanism for that phenomenon.

## What did Harvey's discovery about the circulatory system reveal that was not previously known?

Harvey's discovery revealed the general phenomenon of the circulation of the blood, which was not previously recognized. Before this discovery, investigators assumed that both arteries and veins transported material to body tissues by newer material pushing older material along. Harvey's work established the need for a pump to move blood, delineating the mechanism of blood circulation.

## Explain what unites a set of parts and operations into a given mechanism.

A set of parts and operations is united into a given mechanism by their organization and their orchestrated functioning in producing a particular phenomenon. Different mechanisms may be instantiated in the same spatial-temporal region and substance, sharing many component parts and operations, but the specific organization and function are what define a particular mechanism.
