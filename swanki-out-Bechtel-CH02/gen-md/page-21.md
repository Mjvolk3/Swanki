## What is simulation in the context of perceptual symbols according to Barsalou?

Simulation, as referred to by Barsalou, involves the brain initiating sequences of operations that correspond to what would happen if confronted with actual input from visual objects behaving in a particular manner.

## What are two tools mentioned for understanding complex mechanisms when mental animation fails?

The two tools mentioned are:
1. Building a scale model or a simplified version of the system.
2. Devising equations that accurately characterize the changes in the system over time and solving these equations, sometimes with the aid of a computer.

## Why do scientists and engineers use tools to simulate systems rather than relying solely on mental animation?

Scientists and engineers use tools to simulate systems because mental animation often falters with complex mechanisms having multiple components and interactions. These tools help to avoid losing track of some interactions that humans might overlook, ensuring a more accurate understanding of the system.

## How do higher-level computer languages contribute to the simulation of complex systems?

Higher-level computer languages are designed to represent complex structures and their interactions. Using these resources, one can create computer simulations that accurately depict the interactions in a complex system.
