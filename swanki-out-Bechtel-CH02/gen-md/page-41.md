## What complementary approach to inhibition can be used to study cellular mechanisms, and what are the limitations of this approach?

The complementary approach is stimulation, but this approach can lead to anomalous results, either because the substance did not reach the correct point in the pathway or because other components did not cooperate appropriately (e.g., due to feedback loops).

### Explanation:
Stimulating a process, like supplying an intermediate substance, helps determine if increased output occurs. This technique can be combined with inhibition, e.g., removing an enzyme but supplying the product externally to check for normal pathway continuation.

## Describe an example of a direct observation technique used in neuroscience to study cellular mechanisms.

One example in neuroscience is single neuron recording, where an electrode is inserted near a neuron, stimulating various inputs to see which ones increase or decrease spiking activity.

### Explanation:
Direct observation techniques like this provide compelling evidence of internal processes but do not reveal the exact nature of operations at each locus. They still need to be combined with other techniques like inhibition or stimulation for a complete understanding.

## How can radioactive tracer experiments help in studying cellular pathways, and what is their primary limitation?

Radioactive tracer experiments involve labeling a substrate with a radioactive component and then detecting where the radioactivity appears in the mechanism later.

### Explanation:
These experiments provide compelling evidence for the sequence of internal processes, but they do not reveal the nature of the operations at each locus. Hence, combining them with inhibition or stimulation studies is required.

## Why might the removal of an enzyme in a pathway not necessarily lead to anomalous results?

If researchers inhibit a reaction by removing the enzyme needed for a product but also externally supply that product, the pathway can continue normally, which strongly suggests that the enzyme is part of the normal pathway.

### Explanation:
This combination of inhibition and stimulation provides high confidence that the enzyme plays a specific role in the pathway, mitigating the problem of multiple interpretations due to removing a single component.
