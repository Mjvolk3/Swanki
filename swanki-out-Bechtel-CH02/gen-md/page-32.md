## What critical feature does the second law of thermodynamics imply for closed systems in relation to entropy?

The second law of thermodynamics states that in a closed system, entropy tends to increase. This implies that:

$$ S_{\text{final}} \geq S_{\text{initial}} $$

Where $S$ denotes entropy. The natural state of matter in such a system is to reach a state of maximum entropy, or equilibrium, where the components are equally and randomly distributed.

## Describe the major challenge that biological systems face according to the second law of thermodynamics.

Biological systems, which are highly organized, pose a puzzle under the second law of thermodynamics. The law suggests that such systems should approach thermodynamic equilibrium, a state of maximum entropy. However, biological systems remain organized and far from equilibrium.

## How do biological systems differ from man-made systems in terms of maintaining organization?

Unlike man-made systems that often rely on external repair systems (humans) to maintain organization, biological systems must maintain their organization internally, without external repair people. This self-maintenance involves utilizing energy inputs from the environment.

## Explain why organizing matter contradicts the natural state implied by the second law of thermodynamics and how biological systems address this contradiction.

The natural state of matter, according to the second law of thermodynamics, is disorder (maximum entropy). Biological systems contradict this by being highly organized. They address this contradiction by being open systems where energy enters from the outside and is directed appropriately to maintain organization.
