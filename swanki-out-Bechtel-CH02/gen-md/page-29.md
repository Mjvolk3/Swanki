## Explain Otto Meyerhof's proposed lactic acid cycle, highlighting the biochemical processes involved.

Meyerhof proposed a cycle in which approximately three-quarters of the lactic acid formed during anaerobic muscle contraction is resynthesized to glycogen. The remaining lactic acid molecules are further oxidized to carbon dioxide and water.

$$\text{Lactic Acid} \rightarrow \text{Glycogen} + \text{CO}_{2} + \text{H}_{2}\text{O}$$

## Provide an example of how feedback systems are used in biological cycles for regulation.

One example is the ATP cycle during muscle work, where ATP is broken down to ADP and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$, and resynthesized during energy metabolism to regulate energy use only when needed.

$$\text{ATP} \rightarrow \text{ADP} + \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$$

## What historical examples, outside of biology, demonstrate the use of feedback control systems?

Historical examples include:
1. Water clocks (Ktesibios, ~270 BCE) - maintaining water level for constant flow.
2. Windmills (E. Lee) - fantail system to keep orientation.
3. Furnace temperature regulator (Cornelis Drebbel, ~1624).

## Discuss the concept proposed by James Danielli pertaining to the dynamic equilibrium in biological systems.

James Danielli's "generalized cell theory" proposed that enzymatically controlled reactions form a dynamic equilibrium, buffered against change, so long as material and energy are continuously supplied.

$$\text{Substrate} \rightarrow \text{Product} \rightarrow [ \text{feedback} ] \rightarrow \text{Cycle}$$
