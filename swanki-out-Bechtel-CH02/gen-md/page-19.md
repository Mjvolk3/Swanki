## Describe what happens in the final reaction of glycolysis.

In the final reaction of glycolysis, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) produces pyruvic acid, which subsequently produces acetyl-CoA. Pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl-CoA by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase.

$$
\text{Phosphoenolpyruvate} \rightarrow \text{Pyruvic Acid} \rightarrow \text{Acetyl-CoA}
$$

## What happens if too much acetyl-CoA is produced?

If more acetyl-CoA is produced than can be used in the citric acid cycle, it accumulates and feeds back to inhibit pyruvate kinase, the enzyme responsible for the first step in the reaction. This in turn will stop glucose from entering the glycolytic pathway.

$$
\text{Excess Acetyl-CoA} \rightarrow \text{Inhibition of Pyruvate Kinase} \rightarrow \text{Stop Glycolysis}
$$

## Why are static diagrams limited in explaining mechanisms?

Static diagrams are limited because they cannot capture the dynamic interactions between components of a mechanism. Although they might include arrows to indicate dynamics, the cognitive agent must imagine the different operations being performed to understand the whole mechanism.

## What is a beneficial alternative to static diagrams for understanding cellular metabolism?

Animated diagrams can be beneficial as they relieve the cognitive load on individuals by dynamically demonstrating how the many operations in cellular metabolism are related. These dynamic representations are often far more instructive to novices.
