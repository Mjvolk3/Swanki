## What was Walter Cannon's contribution to the understanding of maintaining the internal environment in biological systems?

Walter Cannon introduced the term homeostasis, derived from Greek words meaning "same" and "state," and described strategies through which animals maintain a relatively constant internal environment. He identified two types of homeostasis:
1. Storing surplus supplies, either by accumulation or conversion (e.g., glucose into glycogen).
2. Altering the rate of continuous processes (e.g., modifying blood flow to maintain uniform temperature).

## Discuss one method of homeostasis mentioned by Walter Cannon that involves storage and accumulation.

Walter Cannon described storing surplus supplies in times of abundance, either by simple accumulation in selected tissues (e.g., water in muscle or skin), or by converting it to a different form (e.g., glucose into glycogen), from which reconversion in times of need is possible. These processes are often controlled neurally.

## Describe the second kind of homeostasis Cannon mentioned involving continuous processes.

The second type of homeostasis Cannon mentioned includes altering the rate of continuous biological processes. An example is changing the rate of blood flow by modifying the size of peripheral blood vessels to maintain a uniform body temperature. This kind of control is integral to maintaining a stable internal environment despite external changes.

## Explain the concept of internal buffering in biological organisms as stated in the paper.

Internal buffering in biological organisms refers to the ability of different internal mechanisms to maintain a stable internal environment. When external conditions change, internal mechanisms detect these changes and act to restore normal conditions. This buffering allows organisms to resist and remain stable despite potential harmful external factors. Bernard and Cannon both noted this function in maintaining homeostasis.
