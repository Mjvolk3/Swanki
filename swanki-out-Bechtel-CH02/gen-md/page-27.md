Bichat identified two features of tissues that he thought defied mechanistic explanation:

1. Tissues are indeterministic in their response to external stimuli.
2. Tissues seem to resist environmental forces that threaten them.

## How did Claude Bernard challenge Bichat's view on mechanistic explanations in biological systems?

Claude Bernard addressed Bichat's view by identifying principles of organization in living systems that could account for the features Bichat pointed out. Bernard proposed the existence of two environments:

1. **External environment:** The environment in which the organism as a whole lives.
2. **Internal environment:** The local environment of each organ within a living organism.

He suggested that the internal environment serves as a buffer and that component mechanisms in the organism interact directly with this internal environment, leading to deterministic behavior of organs under specific conditions.

## What role does the internal environment play in Bernard’s mechanistic view of biological systems?

In Bernard’s mechanistic view, the internal environment:

- Acts as a buffer between the external environment and local mechanisms.
- Ensures that component mechanisms interact directly with the internal environment and not the external environment.
- Leads to deterministic responses from organs under varying internal environmental conditions.

For example, decreased glucose levels in the blood could lead to lowered metabolic activity in somatic tissues.

## According to Claude Bernard, how do various organs within an organism respond to the internal environment? Provide an example.

According to Claude Bernard, various organs within an organism respond to the conditions of the internal environment, and these responses are quite deterministic. For instance:

- When glucose levels in the blood **decrease**, metabolic activity in somatic tissues **decreases** or the tissues might rely on a different metabolite.
