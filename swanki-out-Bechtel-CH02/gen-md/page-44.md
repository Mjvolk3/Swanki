## What is one method researchers use to diagnose if a component of a mechanism is not performing its hypothetical function?

Researchers often intervene in a way known to incapacitate a component and observe if there is a specific change in the mechanism's behavior, indicating whether the suspected part is involved in the operation.

## Explain how the initial steps in researching cellular mechanisms typically begin.

Research typically begins with an oversimplified account or a sketch, which includes only a few components and organizational aspects. This sketch is gradually revised and filled in over time.

## {{c1::What is a sketch of a mechanism}} in the context of mechanistic explanations according to Machamer, Darden, and Craver (2000)?

## What formal scientific approach does the long-term process of discovering and testing mechanisms resemble?

The process of discovering and testing mechanisms resembles a research program, as proposed by Lakatos (1970), more than the classical account of theory-testing.
