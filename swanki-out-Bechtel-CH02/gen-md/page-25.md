## The mechanism as a whole and its function linkage to the environment
In a mechanistic account, why is it important to consider both the lower-level operations of components and the higher-level functioning of the whole mechanism?

It is crucial to consider both the lower-level operations and the higher-level functioning of the mechanism because the lower-level components and their interactions provide the basis for the mechanism's function, but the function itself is defined by the mechanism's interaction with its environment. Investigators characterize the high-level functioning in context (e.g., yeast cells switching from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism) while biochemical processes reveal the underlying components and operations enabling the function. Both perspectives are necessary to provide a comprehensive explanation.

## Yeast cells switching metabolism
What example does Pasteur provide to illustrate the interaction between a mechanism and its environment?

Pasteur exemplifies yeast cells switching from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism in response to the presence or absence of oxygen in their environment. This switch is a function performed by the glycolytic system in the cells and is best understood with both biochemical studies revealing the mechanism and higher-level characterizations by observing the environmental interactions.

## Hierarchical levels in mechanistic explanations
How do mechanistic explanations account for the autonomy of higher levels of organization?

Mechanistic explanations recognize the autonomy of higher levels of organization by considering that the operations at each level are unique and require specific tools for investigation. Although lower-level components form the basis of the mechanism, the functioning and interactions at a higher level are not superfluous and must be accounted for to provide a complete explanation.

## Engineering perspective on organizing components
How does the perspective of an engineer illustrate the significance of organization in mechanistic explanation?

An engineer's approach demonstrates the importance of organizing components in new ways to accomplish tasks. Engineers use known components and reorganize them to build new mechanisms that perform new functions, often patentable despite the components being previously known. This highlights that the innovation and function arise from how components are put together, similar to the mechanistic account of combining parts to generate higher levels of function.
