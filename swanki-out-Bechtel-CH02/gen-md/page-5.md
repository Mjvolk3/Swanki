## What does Newton's first law of motion state and how does it exemplify the law-based tradition mentioned in the paper?

Newton's first law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by a net external force. This law exemplifies the law-based tradition as it describes a regularity in the universe economically and precisely, allowing scientists to explain particular phenomena.

$$
\text{First Law: } F_{\text{net}} = 0 \implies \Delta v = 0
$$

Where:
- $ F_{\text{net}} $ denotes the net external force,
- $\Delta v$ represents the change in velocity (which is zero if the object remains at rest or in uniform motion).

## Explain how Newton used the concept of forces to explain the reflection of light according to the paper.

To explain the reflection of light, Newton posited a repulsive force between a light ray and its source. As soon as a ray left the area of attraction, it was influenced by this repulsive force, causing reflection.

$$
F_{\text{rep}} = F_{\text{attraction}} \implies \text{Reflection}
$$

## What was the theological perspective's influence on the scientific approach to natural laws as mentioned by Ronald Giere (1999)?

Giere proposed that early modern philosophers, influenced by theological perspectives, conceived the principles governing the natural world on the model of civil laws with God as the lawgiver. This approach emphasized describing regularities precisely in laws to explain phenomena.

## How did Newton attribute vaporization to repulsive forces in his law-based tradition?

Newton attributed vaporization to a repulsive force. He posited that similar repulsive forces between particles caused them to move apart, resulting in the transition from liquid to vapor state.

$$
F_{\text{rep}} > F_{\text{cohesion}} \implies \text{Vaporization}
$$

Where:
- $F_{\text{rep}}$ represents the repulsive force,
- $F_{\text{cohesion}}$ represents the cohesive forces between particles.
