## According to Newton, how can the phenomena of Nature be derived?

Newton suggested that the phenomena of Nature could be derived through reasoning from mechanical principles, even though these forces are unknown and operate over a distance. He expressed hope that his laid-down principles might reveal some light on this or a truer method of philosophy (Principia, Preface to the First Edition).

## What was Newton's stance on the interaction of forces compared to the mechanical philosophy?

Newton envisaged forces as operating over distances, whereas the mechanical philosophy, especially as developed by Descartes, insisted on contact in any causal interaction. In the preface to Principia, Newton referred to these forces as mechanical principles despite their non-contact nature.

## According to the dominant twentieth-century philosophy of science, how should explanations be framed?

The dominant twentieth-century philosophy of science, influenced by logical empiricists, focused on explanations in terms of laws and rejected positing hidden causal relations between events. This perspective is largely Humean and antimetaphysical, emphasizing the observation of event sequences without inferring connecting hidden mechanisms.

## What was the division within the Newtonian school of thought regarding forces?

Two schools of Newtonians developed: 
1. Those who accepted the concept of action at a distance, converting ether into magnetic and electric fluids when necessary and generally following theories from Principia.
2. Those who maintained the necessity of mechanical contact in all actions of forces, using Newton's ether to form a complex mechanical system.
