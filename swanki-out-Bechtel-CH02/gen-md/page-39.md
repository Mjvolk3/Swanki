## How do investigators demarcate different regions of the cortex in the absence of direct neural operation data?

The early 20th-century investigations utilized neuron type and cortical layer thickness to demarcate regions.

## Describe the integration of structural and functional decomposition in identifying working parts within cellular mechanisms.

The integration involves combining the structural breakdown of a cell with its functional breakdown to determine its operational parts.

## What is the typical biochemical operation involved in mechanisms like glycolysis, and how did biochemists identify these operations?

In biochemistry, a typical operation is a chemical reaction catalyzed by an enzyme, transforming substrates into products. For glycolysis, biochemists identified these reactions through functional decomposition, even without knowing the enzyme structures.

## How do functional decompositions sometimes precede structural decompositions in identifying component operations within a mechanism?

Functional decompositions can precede structural ones by designing perturbations in the system to provide clues about the internal operations, allowing the determination of these operations before identifying the active enzymes or structures involved.
