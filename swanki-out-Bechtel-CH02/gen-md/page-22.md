## Why do Larkin and Simon (1987) argue that diagrams can differ from linguistic representations in ease of search and pattern recognition, despite being informationally equivalent?

According to Larkin and Simon (1987), diagrams can differ from linguistic representations in ease of search and pattern recognition because information implicit in linguistic representations may be made explicit in diagrams. This explicit information facilitates reasoning, pattern recognition, and the inference procedures required.

## What advantage do Stenning and Lemon (2001) attribute to the constrained expressive power of diagrams compared to propositions?

Stenning and Lemon (2001) suggest that the constrained expressive power of diagrams makes them more tractable compared to propositions. However, the advantage provided by these constraints is dependent upon the subject supplying an appropriate interpretation.

## What is the hierarchical, mereological framework in the context of mechanisms' component parts and operations?

In the context of mechanisms' component parts (structure) and operations (function), a hierarchical, mereological framework is used to bring orderliness to different levels of entities. The parts and their operations occupy lower levels than the mechanism itself, which has an overall function.

## How does mechanistic explanation differ from popular and philosophical notions of reduction?

Mechanistic explanation involves appealing to lower levels (component parts and operations) to explain a mechanism's functioning without denying the efficacy of higher levels. This differs from popular and philosophical notions of reduction that suggest lower levels negate higher levels' significance.
