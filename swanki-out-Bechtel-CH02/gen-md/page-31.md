## What principle did Wiener and his colleagues articulate, which was published in the journal "Philosophy of Science"?

Wiener and his colleagues articulated a basic principle of purposive and teleological behavior, whether in animals or machines. According to their account, the concept of a purposeful act denoted behavior directed towards attaining a goal, either in time or space. They further differentiated between feedback (teleological) and non-feedback (non-teleological) behavior.

## What is the distinction between 'purposeful' and 'teleological' as outlined by Wiener, Rosenblueth, and Bigelow?

The distinction lies in the context of feedback. Purposeful behavior is a broader term signifying goal-directed actions. Within this category, teleological (or feedback) behavior uses feedback mechanisms to achieve the goal, whereas non-teleological (non-feedback) behavior does not.

## What mechanical advantages did James Watt's governor introduce to the steam engine?

James Watt's governor introduced a feedback mechanism, where the centrifugal force acting on the balls (attached to the spindle connected to the flywheel) controlled the steam flow valve. This ensured that steam flowed based on the required flywheel speed, maintaining the desired operation speed.

## How did the technological limitations affect Wiener's design and his contract with the Department of Defense?

Wiener's design faced failure due to the limitations of the available hardware for implementation. This led to the termination of his contract with the Department of Defense.
