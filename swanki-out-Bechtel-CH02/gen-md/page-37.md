## Explain why reverse engineering of biological systems is often challenging.

Reverse engineering biological systems is challenging because researchers must rely on experimental manipulations to take apart and reveal the parts and operations within the systems. The intricate and hidden nature of these parts and operations adds complexity to the investigative process.

## Describe the two main experimental approaches used in identifying component parts of biological mechanisms.

The two main experimental approaches are:
1. Procedures directed at the identification of component parts.
2. Procedures focused on component operations.

These methods aim to break down and understand the functional components and their actions within the biological mechanisms.

## Differentiate between structural decomposition and functional decomposition in biological research.

In biological research, structural decomposition refers to breaking a system into its physical parts, while functional decomposition aims to identify parts that perform specific operations. Functional decomposition is more useful for explaining phenomena because it focuses on how the parts contribute to the overall function.

## Who pointed out that dicing a system into cubes does not result in parts that perform operations, and what is the implication of this?

Michael Craver pointed out that dicing a system into cubes does not result in parts that perform operations. The implication is that not all structural decompositions are functionally meaningful, and researchers must focus on breaking a system into parts that actually perform the necessary operations to understand the phenomenon.
