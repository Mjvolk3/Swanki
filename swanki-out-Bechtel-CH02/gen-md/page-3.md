## Who were some early proponents of atomism and what aspects of matter did they use to explain macroscopic phenomena?

Leucippus and Democritus, early proponents of atomism, characterized elementary particles, or atoms, based on their shape and size to explain the properties of macroscopic objects. For instance, Democritus suggested that hot bodies were made of small and round fire elements, whereas cold bodies were composed of larger particles with sharp points.

## What explanation did Galileo Galilei offer for the power of heat to liquefy metals?

Galileo Galilei explained that the extremely fine particles of fire penetrate the slender pores of the metal, fill the small intervening vacua, and free the metal particles from their mutual attraction. This allows the particles to move freely, making the metal fluid. However, once the particles of fire leave, the original attraction returns, and the metal re-solidifies.

## How did Rene Descartes contribute to the mechanical philosophy, and how did his views differ from those of ancient atomists?

Rene Descartes expanded the mechanical philosophy by considering both the shapes and movements of parts. Unlike ancient atomists, he emphasized that any movement of one object requires the movement of other objects due to the lack of empty space. His mechanistic view suggested that the universe operates like a machine where movement is interconnected.

## How does Descartes' view of mechanics contrast with those of ancient mechanics and Aristotelians?

Descartes argued for treating the universe as a machine driven by the movement of interconnected parts, which was different from the ancient mechanics and Aristotelians who often saw mechanics as opposed to nature. This mechanistic perspective involved treating natural changes as consequences of parts in motion rather than external forces or intrinsic qualities.
