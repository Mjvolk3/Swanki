## What is a significant aspect that engineers contribute when building mechanisms from off-the-shelf components?
  
Engineers significantly contribute {{c1::organization of parts and operations}} when building mechanisms from off-the-shelf components. This organization enables the mechanism to perform {{c1::new functions}} that the individual components alone could not achieve.

## How does context play a role in the functionality of engineered mechanisms?

Engineered mechanisms can fail when {{c1::operated in contexts other than those for which they were designed}}. The wrong context can hinder operation, while the appropriate context can {{c1::support or co-opt the mechanism's operation}}.

## Why is understanding context especially important for biologically evolved mechanisms?

Biologically evolved mechanisms are particularly influenced by their context because {{c1::evolution adapts to environmental reliability}}. For example, humans do not synthesize certain vitamins since {{c1::our ancestors could rely on their availability in food}}.

## How did Salmon expand the mechanistic understanding compared to Descartes' features?

Salmon expanded the mechanistic understanding by including more features than just shape and motion, such as {{c1::gravitational and electromagnetic fields}}. In biology, the expansion also includes {{c2::chemical bonds and catalysis}}.
