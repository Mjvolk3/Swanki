## What was the significant recognition that Christian de Duve had about lysosomes and their biochemical investigation?

Christian de Duve's recognition of the lysosome was sparked by an unexpected failure in his biochemical investigation of a liver enzyme. He recalled Claude's diagrams showing the agglutination at $p \mathrm{H} 5$ of both large and small granules and concluded that the enzyme was likely firmly attached to some subcellular structure.

## Why might scientists prefer to represent certain information diagrammatically rather than propositionally? Discuss at least two specific reasons mentioned in the text.

Scientists might prefer to represent information diagrammatically for several reasons: 

1. Spatial layout and organization is often critical to the operation of a mechanism itself, and diagrams make use of space to convey information effectively.
2. Diagrams can take advantage of dimensions other than space that visual processing can access, including color and shape, which can convey additional layers of information.

## How does the use of space in diagrams support the explanation of mechanisms?

The use of space in diagrams supports the explanation of mechanisms by allowing different operations to be shown at different locations. This spatial distribution can preserve the separation, association, and organization of operations, effectively representing the physical and conceptual layout of mechanisms.

## Explain the challenge of representing temporal order in two-dimensional diagrams, as mentioned in the paper. Suggest one way this challenge is addressed.

The challenge of representing temporal order in two-dimensional diagrams arises because using one dimension to convey temporal order leaves only one dimension for everything other than time. This can be addressed by using one of the spatial dimensions in a diagram to capture temporal order, effectively transforming time into a spatial element in the diagram.
