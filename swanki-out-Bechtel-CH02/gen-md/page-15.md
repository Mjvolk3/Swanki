## What does the phenomenon of the heart pumping blood depend on?

The phenomenon of the heart pumping blood depends on several factors:
- The spatial organization of component parts (e.g., veins, atria, ventricles, arteries).
- The temporal organization of component operations (movements).
- The fine-grained spatiotemporal orchestration of these moving parts in real-time.

## Explain the importance of organization in biological mechanisms.

Organization in biological mechanisms is crucial because:
1. Components need reliable access to products of other components (spatial contiguity or transport modes).
2. Biological systems often incorporate feedback and control systems, unlike simple sequential arrangements used in human manufacturing.
3. More complex modes of organization allow for the regulation of some components by other components.

## What is the key difference between biological and non-biological mechanisms according to the text?

The key difference between biological and non-biological mechanisms lies in the complexity of organization:
- Biological mechanisms incorporate feedback and control systems enabling regulation of behavioral components.
- Non-biological mechanisms, such as human manufacturing assembly lines, often use simpler sequential arrangements.

## How does Salmon (1984) distinguish between ontic and epistemic conceptions of explanation?

Salmon (1984) distinguishes between ontic and epistemic conceptions of explanation as follows:
- Ontic conception: Appeals to the actual mechanism in nature, identifying causal relations and mechanisms operative in nature.
- Epistemic conception: Appeals to laws and derivations from laws, which are products of mental activities.
