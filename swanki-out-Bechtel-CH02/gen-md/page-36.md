## What is typically the focus during the process of discovery when the context involves mechanisms?
  
Logical empiricists generally rejected the idea that philosophical analysis could contribute to the context of discovery, focusing instead on the context of justification. However, Nickles (1980a, 1980b) rekindled interest in discovery, and Darden (1991) emphasized that significant insight can be gained about scientific discovery when mechanisms are the focus.

## When it comes to decomposing mechanisms, researchers typically use which two distinct approaches?

Researchers decompose mechanisms using either structural or functional approaches. Structural decomposition focuses on identifying the component parts of the mechanism, while functional decomposition focuses on the operations these parts perform.

## What are the three main goals an investigator aims to achieve while discovering a mechanism?

The goals are to:
1. Identify the parts of the mechanism.
2. Determine the operations these parts perform.
3. Understand how these parts and operations are organized to generate the phenomenon of interest.

## What do experiments designed to establish phenomena generally seek to determine, and how do they achieve this?

These experiments aim to determine regularities in the mechanism's behavior by establishing relations between inputs, operational conditions, and outputs. This is achieved by measuring relevant variables and manipulating some of them, as exemplified by Lavoisier and LaPlace's (1780) calorimeter experiments and Pasteur's (1861) fermentation studies.
