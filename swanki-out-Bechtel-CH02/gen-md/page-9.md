## What kind of parts do component operations in biological mechanisms typically involve, and what are the roles of these parts?

Each component operation in biological mechanisms typically involves at least one component part: an active part and at least one passive part. The active part initiates or maintains the operation and may be changed by it, while the passive part is changed by the operation. The change could involve the location or other properties of a part, or it may transform it into another kind of part.

## Discuss the distinction between observations and phenomena according to Bogen and Woodward.

Bogen and Woodward made a distinction between observations and phenomena. Observations provide data, which scientists use to explain phenomena. However, it is not the observations themselves that scientists are explaining, but rather the occurrences in the world (phenomena) about which data can be procured. Even if data do not turn out as expected, scientists seek to explain the underlying phenomena, not the data itself.

## In the empirical philosophy of science, how did the views of Hanson and Kuhn challenge the traditional notion of observations?

Hanson (1948) and Kuhn (1962/1970) challenged the traditional notion in logical empiricist philosophy of science that explanations are based on observation statements, arguing that observations are theory-laden. This means that what scientists observe is influenced by the theories they hold, potentially creating a circularity: theories being tested by observations that are shaped by the theories themselves.

## What did Bogen and Woodward cite as an example of a non-existent phenomenon, and what does this example illustrate?

Bogen and Woodward cited the example of $\mathrm{N}$-rays, a phenomenon posited by French physicists in the early 20th century based on several observations. Ultimately, more careful data collection demonstrated that such a phenomenon did not exist. This example illustrates that not all purported phenomena based on initial observations hold up under rigorous scientific scrutiny.
