## How do scientists distinguish between the mechanism and the mechanistic explanation when exploring cellular phenomena?

The distinction is based on the representation and interpretation by scientists. While the mechanism refers to the actual process occurring in nature, the mechanistic explanation is the scientist's rendering of this process.

## Describe the role of diagrams in representing mechanistic explanations in scientific papers.

Diagrams serve as vehicles for representing complex interactions among operations within mechanisms. They allow for a holistic view that text alone cannot provide. Commentary, both in figure captions and within the text, supports the understanding of these diagrams.

## Explain why incorrect mechanistic explanations still involve mechanisms. 

Incorrect mechanistic explanations still reference mechanisms, though not operative in nature. The represented mechanism plays a key role in the explanation process even if it doesn't match the actual phenomenon.

## Discuss the epistemic character of mechanistic explanations according to the text.

Mechanistic explanations are epistemic activities generated by scientists. The actual cell mechanisms existed long before their discovery, and the explanations involve scientists' representations of these mechanisms.
