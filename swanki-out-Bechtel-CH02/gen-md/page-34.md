## Define autonomy as used by Varela and by Ruiz-Mirazo, Peretó, and Moreno in the context of living systems.

Autonomy, according to Varela, is the ability of a system to define and maintain its own boundaries. Ruiz-Mirazo, Peretó, and Moreno elaborate on this by defining an autonomous system as:

"A far-from-equilibrium system that constitutes and maintains itself, establishing an organizational identity of its own. It is a functionally integrated (homeostatic and active) unit based on a set of endergonic-exergonic couplings between internal self-constructing processes, and interactions with its environment."

## Explain the relation between Bichat's critique of mechanism and the concept of self-organizing processes in living systems.

Bichat contended that living systems resist death and adapt over time to novel environments, highlighting a key feature of living systems—their adaptive capacities. This aligns with the concept of self-organizing processes in living systems, which are built up through:

- Internal self-constructing processes.
- Endergonic-exergonic couplings.
- Interactions with the environment.

These self-organizing processes enable the system to establish and maintain its own boundaries and organizational identity (autonomy).

## Describe Piaget's constructivism and how it contrasts with nature and nurture positions in cognitive development.

Jean Piaget proposed constructivism as a middle path between the polar positions of nature and nurture in cognitive development. According to Piaget:

"The essential functions of the mind consist in understanding and in inventing, in other words, in building up structures by structuring reality."

This suggests that cognitive development involves the active construction of knowledge by interacting with and organizing one's experience of the environment. In contrast:

- Nature position: Attributes cognitive development to innate structures.
- Nurture position: Attributes cognitive development to environmental interactions.

## Explore Jerry Fodor's critique of Piaget's constructivism.

Jerry Fodor criticized Piaget's constructivism by arguing that learning a richer logic from a weaker logic through hypothesis formation and confirmation necessitates innate capacities. Fodor stated:

"It is never possible to learn a richer logic on the basis of a weaker logic, if what you mean by learning is hypothesis formation and confirmation."

He suggested that the capacity to represent and test hypotheses must be innate, requiring a native endowment that supports hypothesis formation and representation.
