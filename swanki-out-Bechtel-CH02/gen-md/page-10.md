## According to Galileo, what is the relationship between the distance travelled by an object falling freely near the surface of the earth and the time it falls?

$$

where $d$ is the distance travelled, and $t$ is the time in seconds.

## How did researchers revise the conception of what genes code for over time?

In the 1860s, Gregor Mendel spoke of factors for traits. In the 1910s, Thomas Hunt Morgan and his collaborators localized genes for traits like eye color. In the 1940s, Beadle and Tatum linked genes to individual enzymes.
