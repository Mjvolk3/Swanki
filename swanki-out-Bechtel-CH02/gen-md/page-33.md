## Explain the Belousov-Zhabotinskii (B-Z) reaction and its importance in the context of dissipative structures.

The Belousov-Zhabotinskii (B-Z) reaction is an example of a self-organizing chemical system that gives rise to complex patterns through simple component reactions. This reaction demonstrates the concept of dissipative structures, which are highly organized systems maintained far from thermodynamic equilibrium by a constant energy flow.

## What are the key characteristics of autopoietic machines as defined by Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana?

Autopoietic machines have two key characteristics:
1. Their components through interactions and transformations continuously regenerate and realize the network of processes (relations) that produced them.
2. They constitute the machine as a concrete unity in the space in which they exist by specifying the topological domain of its realization as such a network.

## What is meant by the term "dissipative structures" as coined by Ilya Prigogine?

Dissipative structures refer to constantly changing, highly organized systems maintained far from thermodynamic equilibrium. They depend on a constant flow of energy through the system, which is used to create order and then dissipates as heat.

## Describe why a partially porous boundary is essential for the smooth operation of an autopoietic machine.

A partially porous boundary, such as a semi-permeable membrane, is essential for an autopoietic machine because it allows the system to control what materials are admitted and expelled. This ensures that energy and raw materials are delivered where needed for the system to make new components, thus maintaining its organization and operations.
