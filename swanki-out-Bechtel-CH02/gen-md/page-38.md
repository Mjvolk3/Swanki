## Describe one method researchers use to identify the parts of a mechanism and the challenge associated with it.

Researchers sometimes apply physical force to break down a mechanism into separate components for further investigation. A significant challenge is determining the correct amount of force necessary: too much force can completely obliterate the components of interest.

## Explain how visualization techniques contribute to identifying working parts in mechanisms.

Visualization techniques, such as using light and electron microscopes, allow researchers to see internal components. These visualizations provide partitioning based on appearance, which needs corroboration by other methods to confirm the correspondence to working parts.

$$
\text{Electron Microscopy} \rightarrow \text{Smaller parts within cells}

## What is the difference in identifying components in a cell versus a brain, according to the text?

Identifying components in a cell can be achieved through physical methods (e.g., homogenizing a cell) or visualization (e.g., using a light microscope). In contrast, identifying working parts in the brain is more complex due to its highly convoluted structure, where natural boundaries (sulci and gyri) do not necessarily reflect functional units.

## What purpose does anatomical dissection serve, and what is the challenge associated with it?

Anatomical dissection is used to physically isolate parts within an organism. The primary challenge is to ensure dissection cuts at natural joints and not within parts, as distinguishing clear boundaries may not always correlate with functionally relevant units.
