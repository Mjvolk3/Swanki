## What are the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions?
The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for the optimization problem of maximizing $f(\mathbf{x})$ subject to $g(\mathbf{x}) \geqslant 0$ include:
$$
\begin{aligned}
g(\mathbf{x}) & \geqslant 0 \\
\lambda & \geqslant 0 \\
\lambda g(\mathbf{x}) & = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

These conditions specify necessary constraints for optimality in non-linear programming problems.

## Describe the Lagrangian function for minimizing $f(\mathbf{x})$ with an inequality constraint $g(\mathbf{x}) \geqslant 0$.

The Lagrangian function for minimizing $f(\mathbf{x})$ subject to an inequality constraint $g(\mathbf{x}) \geqslant 0$ is given by:
$$
L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda) = f(\mathbf{x}) - \lambda g(\mathbf{x})
$$
This function should be minimized with respect to $\mathbf{x}$, subject to $\lambda \geqslant 0$.

## How can Lagrangian multipliers be extended to multiple equality and inequality constraints?

To handle multiple constraints, we introduce Lagrange multipliers $\{\lambda_{j}\}$ and $\{\mu_{k}\}$. The Lagrangian function becomes:
$$
L\left(\mathbf{x},\left\{\lambda_{j}\right\},\left\{\mu_{k}\right\}\right) = f(\mathbf{x}) + \sum_{j=1}^{J} \lambda_{j} g_{j}(\mathbf{x}) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \mu_{k} h_{k}(\mathbf{x})
$$
The conditions to be satisfied are $\mu_{k} \geq 0$ and $\mu_{k} h_{k}(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for $k = 1, \ldots, K$.

## When minimizing the function $f(\mathbf{x})$ with a single inequality constraint, what conditions must the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ satisfy?

The Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ for minimizing $f(\mathbf{x})$ with an inequality constraint must satisfy:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\lambda & \geqslant 0 \\
\lambda g(\mathbf{x}) & = 0
\end{aligned}
$$
These ensure that the constraint is properly handled in the optimization process.

## What modifications are made to the Lagrangian function when maximizing $f(\mathbf{x})$ subject to both equality and inequality constraints?

For maximizing $f(\mathbf{x})$ subject to equality constraints $g_j(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ and inequality constraints $h_k(\mathbf{x}) \geqslant 0$, the Lagrangian function is modified to:
$$
L\left(\mathbf{x},\left\{\lambda_{j}\right\},\left\{\mu_{k}\right\}\right) = f(\mathbf{x}) + \sum_{j=1}^{J} \lambda_{j} g_{j}(\mathbf{x}) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \mu_{k} h_{k}(\mathbf{x})
$$
This accounts for both sets of constraints in the optimization problem.

## In the context of constraints, what are the primary roles of the Lagrange multipliers $\{\lambda_j\}$ and $\{\mu_k\}$?

The Lagrange multipliers $\{\lambda_j\}$ are associated with equality constraints $g_j(\mathbf{x}) = 0$, and the multipliers $\{\mu_k\}$ are associated with inequality constraints $h_k(\mathbf{x}) \geqslant 0$. They ensure that these constraints are accounted for in the optimization problem.
