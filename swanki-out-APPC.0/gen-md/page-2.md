## Describe the technique of Lagrange multipliers for maximizing a function under a constraint. Specify the LaTeX representation of the Lagrangian function.

The technique of Lagrange multipliers is used to maximize a function $f(\mathbf{x})$ subject to a constraint $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$. The geometrical representation shows that the constraint forms a subspace, and at the maximum point $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$, the gradients $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$ are parallel. The key Lagrangian function $L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda)$ is defined as:
$$
L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda) = f(\mathbf{x}) + \lambda g(\mathbf{x})
$$
where $\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier.

## What are the conditions that arise from the Lagrangian function for it to be stationary with respect to $\mathbf{x}$ and $\lambda$?

The conditions for the Lagrangian function $L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda) = f(\mathbf{x}) + \lambda g(\mathbf{x})$ to be stationary are:
1. $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} L = 0$
2. $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = 0$

The first condition leads to the equations $\nabla f + \lambda \nabla g = 0$. The second condition recovers the constraint $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$.

## What is the equation that ensures the gradients $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$ are parallel for a constrained maximum, and what does $\lambda$ represent in this context?

The gradients $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$ are parallel when:
$$
\nabla f + \lambda \nabla g = 0
$$
Here, $\lambda \neq 0$ is the Lagrange multiplier, and it ensures that the gradients are parallel (or anti-parallel), indicating that $f(\mathbf{x})$ cannot be increased by moving along the constraint surface $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$.

## For a D-dimensional vector $\mathbf{x}$, explain how many equations are formed by the Lagrange multiplier method and their purpose.

For a $D$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{x}$, the Lagrange multiplier method gives $D+1$ equations. These equations are used to determine both the stationary point $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ and the value of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$. The equations ensure both the function and the constraint conditions are maximized concurrently.

## Derive the stationary conditions for the Lagrangian function for the example $f\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)=1-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}$ given the constraint $g\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)=x_{1}+x_{2}-1=0$.

For the function $f\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)=1-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}$ and constraint $g\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)=x_{1}+x_{2}-1=0$, the corresponding Lagrangian function is:
$$
L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda)=1-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}+\lambda\left(x_{1}+x_{2}-1\right)
$$
The stationary conditions are obtained from:
$$
\begin{aligned}
-2 x_{1}+\lambda & =0 \\
-2 x_{2}+\lambda & =0 \\
x_{1}+x_{2}-1 & =0
\end{aligned}
$$
These equations ensure that the Lagrangian is stationary with respect to $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, and $\lambda$.

## Explain how the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ is determined in the method of Lagrange multipliers, and why it's termed 'undetermined multiplier'.

In the Lagrange multiplier method, $\lambda$ is determined indirectly through the stationary conditions $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} L = 0$ and $\partial L / \partial \lambda = 0$. These conditions allow us to solve for $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ without explicitly finding $\lambda$, hence the term 'undetermined multiplier'. $\lambda$ essentially balances the gradient of the function relative to the gradient of the constraint.
