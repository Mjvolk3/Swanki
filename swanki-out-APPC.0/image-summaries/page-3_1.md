ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided is a mathematical diagram illustrating an example of using Lagrange multipliers. This is a two-dimensional graph with x1 as the horizontal axis and x2 as the vertical axis. It depicts several circular contours represented by concentric blue circles, which are level curves of a function f(x1, x2). The function f(x1, x2) is given in the paper as \( f(x_{1}, x_{2}) = 1 - x_{1}^{2} - x_{2}^{2} \).

The red line represents a constraint surface described by the equation \( g(x_{1}, x_{2}) = x_{1} + x_{2} - 1 = 0 \). This straight line crosses through the origin of the graph and forms a diagonal cutting across the circular contours.

At the intersection of the blue contour, which is locus of points giving the same value of the function f(x1, x2), and the red constraint line g(x1, x2) = 0, we have a black point. This point, labeled \( (x_{1}^{*}, x_{2}^{*}) \), represents the optimal solution—i.e., the stationary point under the constraint g(x1, x2) = 0—where the function f(x1, x2) reaches its maximum value given the constraint.

The image serves to aid in visualization of the concepts described in the paper and helps to illustrate the geometric interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier method when locating a maximum of a function subject to a constraint.
