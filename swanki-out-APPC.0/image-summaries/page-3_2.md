ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided here appears to illustrate the concept of maximizing a function \( f(\mathbf{x}) \) subject to an inequality constraint \( g(\mathbf{x}) \geqslant 0 \) using Lagrange multipliers. It is likely related to Figure C.3 in the text, showing an area (highlighted in light brown/tan color) where \( g(x) > 0 \), indicating a feasible region defined by the inequality constraint. The function \( g(x) = 0 \) is represented by a black curve that marks the boundary of this feasible region.

Within this region, we see two points, labeled \( x_A \) and \( x_B \). At point \( x_A \), which lies on the boundary \( g(x) = 0 \), we see a vector \( \nabla f(x) \) pointing outwards, which represents the gradient of the function \( f(\mathbf{x}) \). Another vector \( \nabla g(x) \) is depicted at some location in the feasible region, and this vector is orthogonal to the boundary curve \( g(x) = 0 \), representing the gradient of the constraint function \( g(\mathbf{x}) \).

According to Lagrange multiplier theory, the maximum of the function occurs when the gradient \( \nabla f(x) \) is oriented away from the region where \( g(x) > 0 \) and is equal to \( -\lambda \nabla g(x) \) where \( \lambda > 0 \). The image is a graphical representation of this condition and is a common illustrative technique in optimization and calculus topics dealing with constrained optimization problems.
