How does the provided image illustrate the concept of maximizing a function $f(\mathbf{x})$ subject to an inequality constraint $g(\mathbf{x}) \geqslant 0$ using Lagrange multipliers?

%

The image illustrates the concept of maximizing $f(\mathbf{x})$ subject to $g(\mathbf{x}) \geqslant 0$ by showing:
- The feasible region, where $g(\mathbf{x}) > 0$, highlighted in light brown/tan color.
- The boundary $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ marked by a black curve.
- Two points \( x_A \) and \( x_B \) within the region.
- At point \( x_A \), \( \nabla f(x) \) (the gradient of $f(\mathbf{x})$) is oriented outwards and \( \nabla g(x) \) (the gradient of $g(\mathbf{x})$) is orthogonal to $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$.
- According to Lagrange multiplier theory, the maximum of $f(\mathbf{x})$ occurs where $\nabla f(x) = -\lambda \nabla g(x)$ with $\lambda > 0$.

What is the significance of the points \( x_A \) and the boundary curve \( g(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \) in the provided image?

%

In the provided image:
- The point \( x_A \) lies on the boundary \( g(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \), indicating the edge of the feasible region.
- The boundary curve \( g(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \) delineates where the inequality constraint transforms into an equality.
- The vector \( \nabla f(x) \) at \( x_A \) represents the gradient of the objective function $f(\mathbf{x})$, pointing outward from the boundary.
- The vector \( \nabla g(x) \) represents the gradient of the constraint function $g(\mathbf{x})$, orthogonal to the boundary curve.
