The geometrical interpretation of the Lagrange multipliers technique involves seeking a point $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ on the constraint surface $g(\mathbf{x})=0$ (represented by the red curve) such that $f(\mathbf{x})$ is maximized. At this optimum point, the gradient $\nabla f(\mathbf{x})$ must be orthogonal to the constraint surface, necessitating that $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$ are parallel (or anti-parallel). Hence, there must exist a parameter $\lambda$ such that:

$$
\nabla f + \lambda \nabla g = 0
$$

where $\lambda \neq 0$ is known as a Lagrange multiplier.

**Explain the condition $\nabla f + \lambda \nabla g = 0$ in the context of Lagrange multipliers with reference to the image.**

The condition $\nabla f + \lambda \nabla g = 0$ in the context of Lagrange multipliers indicates that at an optimum point on the constraint surface $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$, the gradient of the objective function $\nabla f(\mathbf{x})$ is parallel (or anti-parallel) to the gradient of the constraint function $\nabla g(\mathbf{x})$. In the image, $\nabla f(\mathbf{x})$ and $\nabla g(\mathbf{x})$ are illustrated as vectors emanating from the point $\mathbf{x}_A$, demonstrating that the gradients are orthogonal to the curve at the point of tangency, ensuring that the function is at an extremum.
