Figure 2.1: Some discrete distributions on the state space \(\mathcal{X}=\{1,2,3,4\}\). (a) A uniform distribution with \(p(x=k)=1 / 4\). (b) A degenerate distribution (delta function) that puts all its mass on \(x=1\). Generated by discrete_prob_dist_plot.ipynb.

probability mass function or pmf as a function which computes the probability of events which correspond to setting the rv to each possible value:

\[
p(x) \triangleq \operatorname{Pr}(X=x)
\]

The pmf satisfies the properties \(0 \leq p(x) \leq 1\) and \(\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x)=1\).

If \(X\) has a finite number of values, say \(K\), the pmf can be represented as a list of \(K\) numbers, which we can plot as a histogram. For example, Figure 2.1 shows two pmf's defined on \(\mathcal{X}=\{1,2,3,4\}\). On the left we have a uniform distribution, \(p(x)=1 / 4\), and on the right, we have a degenerate distribution, \(p(x)=\mathbb{I}(x=1)\), where \(\mathbb{I}()\) is the binary indicator function. Thus the distribution in Figure 2.1(b) represents the fact that \(X\) is always equal to the value 1. (Thus we see that random variables can also be constant.)

2.2.2 Continuous random variables
}

If \(X \in \mathbb{R}\) is a real-valued quantity, it is called a continuous random variable. In this case, we can no longer create a finite (or countable) set of distinct possible values it can take on. However, there are a countable number of intervals which we can partition the real line into. If we associate events with \(X\) being in each one of these intervals, we can use the methods discussed above for discrete random variables. Informally speaking, we can represent the probability of \(X\) taking on a specific real value by allowing the size of the intervals to shrink to zero, as we show below.

\subsection*{2.2.2.1 Cumulative distribution function (cdf)}

Define the events \(A=(X \leq a), B=(X \leq b)\) and \(C=(a<X \leq b)\), where \(a<b\). We have that \(B=A \vee C\), and since \(A\) and \(C\) are mutually exclusive, the sum rules gives

\[
\operatorname{Pr}(B)=\operatorname{Pr}(A)+\operatorname{Pr}(C)
\]

and hence the probability of being in interval \(C\) is given by

\[
\operatorname{Pr}(C)=\operatorname{Pr}(B)-\operatorname{Pr}(A)
\]
