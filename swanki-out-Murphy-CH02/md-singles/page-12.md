Figure 2.6: Illustration of the Datasaurus Dozen. All of these datasets have the same low order summary statistics. Adapted from Figure 1 of [MF17]. Generated by datasaurus_dozen.ipynb.

function being optimized measures deviation from the target summary statistics of the original dinosaur, plus distance from a particular target shape.)

The same simulated annealing approach can be applied to 1d datasets, as shown in Figure 2.7. We see that all the datasets are quite different, but they all have the same median and inter-quartile range as shown by the central shaded part of the box plots in the middle. A better visualization is known as a violin plot, shown on the right. This shows (two copies of) the \(1 \mathrm{~d}\) kernel density estimate (Section 16.3) of the distribution on the vertical axis, in addition to the median and IQR markers. This visualization is better able to distinguish differences in the distributions. However, the technique is limited to \(1 \mathrm{~d}\) data.

2.3 Bayes' rule
}

Bayes's theorem is to the theory of probability what Pythagoras's theorem is to geometry.
- Sir Harold Jeffreys, 1973 [Jef73].

In this section, we discuss the basics of Bayesian inference. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the term "inference" means "the act of passing from sample data to generalizations, usually with calculated degrees of certainty". The term "Bayesian" is used to refer to inference methods
