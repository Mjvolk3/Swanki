Figure 2.2: (a) Plot of the cdf for the standard normal, \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\). Generated by gauss_plot.ipynb. (b) Corresponding pdf. The shaded regions each contain \(\alpha / 2\) of the probability mass. Therefore the nonshaded region contains \(1-\alpha\) of the probability mass. The leftmost cutoff point is \(\Phi^{-1}(\alpha / 2)\), where \(\Phi\) is the cdf of the Gaussian. By symmetry, the rightmost cutoff point is \(\Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha / 2)=-\Phi^{-1}(\alpha / 2)\). Generated by quantile_plot.ipynb.

In general, we define the cumulative distribution function or cdf of the rv \(X\) as follows:

\[
P(x) \triangleq \operatorname{Pr}(X \leq x)
\]

(Note that we use a capital \(P\) to represent the cdf.) Using this, we can compute the probability of being in any interval as follows:

\[
\operatorname{Pr}(a<X \leq b)=P(b)-P(a)
\]

Cdf's are monotonically non-decreasing functions. See Figure 2.2a for an example, where we illustrate the cdf of a standard normal distribution, \(\mathcal{N}(x \mid 0,1)\); see Section 2.6 for details.

2.2.2.2 Probability density function (pdf)
}

We define the probability density function or pdf as the derivative of the cdf:

\[
p(x) \triangleq \frac{d}{d x} P(x)
\]

(Note that this derivative does not always exist, in which case the pdf is not defined.) See Figure \(2.2 \mathrm{~b}\) for an example, where we illustrate the pdf of a univariate Gaussian (see Section 2.6 for details).

Given a pdf, we can compute the probability of a continuous variable being in a finite interval as follows:

\[
\operatorname{Pr}(a<X \leq b)=\int_{a}^{b} p(x) d x=P(b)-P(a)
\]

As the size of the interval gets smaller, we can write

\[
\operatorname{Pr}(x<X \leq x+d x) \approx p(x) d x
\]

Intuitively, this says the probability of \(X\) being in a small interval around \(x\) is the density at \(x\) times the width of the interval.
