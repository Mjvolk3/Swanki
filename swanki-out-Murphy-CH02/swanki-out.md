## Probability can be interpreted in two main ways. What are they?

The two main interpretations of probability are the frequentist and Bayesian interpretations:

1. **Frequentist Interpretation**: Probabilities represent long-run frequencies of events that can occur multiple times. E.g., the probability of a fair coin landing heads is interpreted as heads appearing about half the time in many repeated trials.
2. **Bayesian Interpretation**: Probabilities quantify our uncertainty or ignorance about an event. This interpretation facilitates modeling uncertainty about one-off events, like the probability that the polar ice cap will melt by 2030 CE.

- #probability, #frequency-analysis.frequentist, #information-theory.bayesian

## What is the main advantage of the Bayesian interpretation of probability over the frequentist interpretation?

The Bayesian interpretation of probability can model our uncertainty about one-off events that do not have long-term frequencies. For instance, it can quantify the probability that a unique event, such as the polar ice cap melting by 2030 CE, will occur. 

- #probability, #information-theory.bayesian, #events.uniqueness

## Define probability in the Bayesian interpretation and explain how it relates to information theory.

In the Bayesian interpretation, probability is used to quantify our uncertainty or ignorance about an event. This view fundamentally relates probability to information theory, where the focus is on modeling our belief or knowledge about the event rather than relying on repeated trials.

- #probability, #information-theory.bayesian, #uncertainty.quantification

## Types of Uncertainty: Describe the two fundamentally different reasons for the uncertainty in predictions.

The uncertainty in predictions can arise due to:

1. **Ignorance of Underlying Causes**: Our lack of knowledge about the hidden causes or mechanisms generating the data.
2. {Second reason to be discussed next}

- #probability, #uncertainty, #data.predictions

## (Cloze) The frequentist interpretation of probability represents {{c1::long-run frequencies of events}} that can happen multiple times, whereas the Bayesian interpretation quantifies {{c1::our uncertainty or ignorance}} about an event.

## Explain how the rules of probability theory apply to both the frequentist and Bayesian interpretations.

The basic rules of probability theory are the same regardless of whether the frequentist or Bayesian interpretation is adopted. This means that while the interpretations of what probability represents may differ, the fundamental mathematical operations and formulas remain consistent.

## Explain the proof of $\mathbb{E}[X]$ based on conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]]$.

To prove this, let us suppose, for simplicity, that $X$ and $Y$ are both discrete random variables. Then we have

$$
\mathbb{E}_{Y}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] =\mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\sum_{x} x p(X=x \mid Y)\right]
$$

Explain the next steps that lead to the conclusion $\mathbb{E}[X]$.

%
The next steps in the proof are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}_{Y}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] & = \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\sum_{x} x p(X=x \mid Y)\right] \\
& = \sum_{y} \left[\sum_{x} x p(X=x \mid Y=y)\right] p(Y=y) \\
& = \sum_{x, y} x p(X=x, Y=y) = \mathbb{E}[X]
\end{aligned}
$$

This demonstrates that the expected value of $X$ is $ \mathbb{E}[X]$, a marginal expectation derived from the law of total expectation.

## What is the law of total variance (or the conditional variance formula)?

The law of total variance or conditional variance formula is stated as:

$$
\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}_{Y}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]] + \mathbb{V}_{Y}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]]
$$
Explain the meaning of each term in this equation.

%
In this context:

- $\mathbb{V}[X]$: The total variance of $X$.
- $\mathbb{E}_{Y}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]]$: The expected value of the conditional variance of $X$ given $Y$.
- $\mathbb{V}_{Y}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]]$: The variance of the conditional expectation of $X$ given $Y$.

This formula integrates both the variability within each conditional component and the variability between the conditional expectations.

- #math #statistics.variance
```

```markdown
## Provide the step-by-step proof of the law of total variance.

Let us define the conditional moments, $\mu_{X \mid Y}=\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]$, $s_{X \mid Y}=\mathbb{E}\left[X^{2} \mid Y\right]$, and $\sigma_{X \mid Y}^{2}=\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]=s_{X \mid Y}-\mu_{X \mid Y}^{2}$.

Start the proof by expressing the total variance $\mathbb{V}[X]$ in terms of conditional moments.

%
Starting with the expression for total variance:

$$
\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}\left[X^{2}\right] - (\mathbb{E}[X])^{2}
$$

First, we use the law of total expectation for $X^2$:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[X^{2}\right] = \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[s_{X \mid Y}\right]
$$

Next, noting that $(\mathbb{E}[X])^{2}$ can be rewritten as:

$$
(\mathbb{E}[X])^{2} = \left( \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\mu_{X \mid Y}\right] \right)^{2}
$$

Therefore, the variance can be expanded as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{V}[X] &= \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[s_{X \mid Y}\right] - \left( \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\mu_{X \mid Y}\right] \right)^{2} \\
&= \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[ \sigma_{X \mid Y}^{2} \right] + \mathbb{E}_{Y} \left[ \mu_{X \mid Y}^{2} \right] - \left( \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\mu_{X \mid Y}\right] \right)^{2} \\
&= \mathbb{E}_{Y} [\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]] + \mathbb{V}_{Y} [\mu_{X \mid Y}]
\end{aligned}
$$

This completes the proof.

## How is the expected duration of a random lightbulb calculated based on conditional expectations?

Suppose $\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=1]=5000$ and $\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=2]=4000$, with $p(Y=1)=0.6$ and $p(Y=2)=0.4$. Calculate $\mathbb{E}[X]$.

%
Using the given information:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = \mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=1] p(Y=1) + \mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=2] p(Y=2)
$$

Substituting the values:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[X] &= 5000 \times 0.6 + 4000 \times 0.4 \\
&= 3000 + 1600 \\
&= 4600
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the expected duration of a random lightbulb is 4600 hours.

## Explain the parameters of a mixture model with two 1D Gaussian components.

Consider a mixture of two 1D Gaussians given by:

$$
p(x) = 0.5 \mathcal{N}(x \mid 0, 0.5) + 0.5 \mathcal{N}(x \mid 2, 0.5)
$$

Describe what each parameter represents.

%
In this mixture model:

- $0.5$: The mixing coefficient for each Gaussian component.
- $\mathcal{N}(x \mid 0, 0.5)$: The first Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance $0.5$.
- $\mathcal{N}(x \mid 2, 0.5)$: The second Gaussian distribution with mean $2$ and variance $0.5$.

The term $p(x)$ represents a probability distribution function that is a weighted combination of two Gaussian distributions.

## Given the law of total expectation, calculate the expected value of $X$ if $\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=y] = a_y$ and $p(Y=y) = b_y$ for discrete $Y$.

Use the law of total expectation $\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{y} \mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=y] p(Y=y)$.

%
Given:

- $\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=y] = a_y$
- $p(Y=y) = b_y$

Substitute these into the law of total expectation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[X] &= \sum_{y} \mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=y] p(Y=y) \\
&= \sum_{y} a_y b_y
\end{aligned}
$$

So the expected value of $X$ is $\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{y} a_y b_y$.

What is the property involving the double expectation of a discrete random variable $X$ given another random variable $Y$?

%

The property states that for discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$, the expectation of the conditional expectation of $X$ given $Y$ equals the overall expectation of $X$. This can be expressed as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[ \mathbb{E}[X \mid Y] ] = \mathbb{E}[X]
$$

The proof involves the following steps:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}_{Y}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] & =\mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\sum_{x} x p(X=x \mid Y)\right] \\
& =\sum_{y}\left[\sum_{x} x p(X=x \mid Y=y)\right] p(Y=y)=\sum_{x, y} x p(X=x, Y=y)=\mathbb{E}[X]

This mixture consists of two Gaussian components with means at 0 and 2, both having a variance of 0.5. The equal mixing coefficients of 0.5 indicate that each component contributes equally to the overall mixture, resulting in a bimodal distribution with two peaks.

## Prove that $\mathbb{E}_{Y}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] = \mathbb{E}[X]$ for discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_13_398d6182f58c2c67baf7g-1.jpg?height=329&width=498&top_left_y=239&top_left_x=751)

%

To prove that $\mathbb{E}_{Y}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] = \mathbb{E}[X]$ for discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$, follow these steps:

1. Start with the law of total expectation:
   $$
   \mathbb{E}_{Y}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] = \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\sum_{x} x p(X=x \mid Y)\right]
   $$

2. Transform the inner expectation:
   $$
   \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\sum_{x} x p(X=x \mid Y)\right] = \sum_{y}\left[\sum_{x} x p(X=x \mid Y=y)\right] p(Y=y)
   $$

3. Combine the sums:
   $$
   \sum_{y}\left[\sum_{x} x p(X=x \mid Y=y)\right] p(Y=y) = \sum_{x, y} x p(X=x, Y=y)
   $$

4. Recognize the joint probability $p(X=x, Y=y)$:
   $$
   \sum_{x, y} x p(X=x, Y=y) = \mathbb{E}[X]
   $$

Therefore,
$$
\mathbb{E}_{Y}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] = \mathbb{E}[X]
$$

## In the given mixture model, identify and explain $\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]]$ and $\mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]]$ with respect to the given parameters.

In the mixture model:

$$
X = \sum_{y=1}^{K} \pi_{y} \mathcal{N}\left(X \mid \mu_{y}, \sigma_{y}\right)
$$

we have $\pi_{1} = \pi_{2} = 0.5, \mu_{1} = 0, \mu_{2} = 2, \sigma_{1} = \sigma_{2} = 0.5$. Therefore:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]] = \pi_{1} \sigma_{1}^{2} + \pi_{2} \sigma_{2}^{2} = 0.25 \\
& \mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] = \pi_{1}\left(\mu_{1} - \bar{\mu}\right)^{2} + \pi_{2}\left(\mu_{2} - \bar{\mu}\right)^{2} = 1
\end{aligned}
$$

## Explain why the variance of $X$ is dominated by the centroids' differences rather than the local variance around each centroid.

Given the mixture model:

$$
X = \sum_{y=1}^{K} \pi_{y} \mathcal{N}\left(X \mid \mu_{y}, \sigma_{y}\right)
$$

and the results:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]] = 0.25 \\
\mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] = 1
$$

The variance of $X$ is dominated by the differences in the centroids' means as shown by:

$$
\mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] \gg \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]]
$$

indicating that the variance due to the means is larger than the local variance around each centroid.

## Describe what Anscombe's quartet demonstrates about summary statistics.

Anscombe's quartet comprises four datasets that have the same low order summary statistics, specifically mean, variance, and correlation coefficient $\rho$:

## Explain the importance of using both summary statistics and data visualization in statistical analysis.

Anscombe's quartet and the Datasaurus Dozen both highlight that:

- Summary statistics (mean, variance, etc.) can be the same for fundamentally different datasets.
- Visualizing data helps reveal patterns and differences not captured by summary statistics alone.
- Comprehensive analysis should always include both numerical summaries and graphical representations to avoid misleading conclusions.

## Summarize the computation of $\mathbb{V}[X]$ in terms of $\mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]]$ and $\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]]$.

The total variance $\mathbb{V}[X]$ can be split into the variance due to the mean (between-group variance) and the average variance within groups (within-group variance):

$$
\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] + \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]]
$$

For the given parameters, we have:

$$
\mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] = 1 \\
\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]] = 0.25
$$

Therefore, 

$$
\mathbb{V}[X] = 1 + 0.25 = 1.25
$$

## Explain the definition of "inference" according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary and its relevance to Bayesian inference.

## How does the same simulated annealing approach optimize deviation in datasets, and why is it limited to 1d data?

## Describe Bayes' rule and its components.

Bayes' rule is a formula for computing the probability distribution over possible values of an unknown quantity $H$ given some observed data $Y=y$.

$$
p(H=h \mid Y=y)=\frac{p(H=h) p(Y=y \mid H=h)}{p(Y=y)}
$$

- The term $p(H)$ represents the prior distribution.
- The term $p(Y \mid H=h)$ represents the observation distribution.
- When we evaluate $p(Y \mid H=h)$ at $y$, we get the likelihood, $p(Y=y \mid H=h)$.
- $p(Y=y)$ is the marginal likelihood.

- #probability-theory.bayes-rule, #statistics.bayesian-inference

---

## What is the product rule of probability and how is it related to Bayes' rule?

The product rule of probability states that the joint probability $p(h, y)$ can be expressed as:

$$
p(h \mid y) p(y) = p(h) p(y \mid h) = p(h, y)
$$

This identity directly leads to the formulation of Bayes' rule:

$$
p(H=h \mid Y=y)=\frac{p(H=h) p(Y=y \mid H=h)}{p(Y=y)}
$$

- #probability-theory.product-rule, #statistics.bayesian-inference

---

## Explain the prior distribution and observation distribution in the context of Bayes' rule.

In Bayes' rule:
- The prior distribution $p(H)$ represents our knowledge about possible values of $H$ before any data is observed.
- The observation distribution $p(Y \mid H=h)$ represents the expected distribution over outcomes $Y$ given that $H=h$.

This can be written as:

$$
p(H=h \mid Y=y)=\frac{p(H=h) p(Y=y \mid H=h)}{p(Y=y)}
$$

- #statistics.bayesian-inference, #probability-theory.bayes-rule

---

## Define the likelihood function in Bayes' rule.

The likelihood function in Bayes' rule is given by:

$$
p(Y=y \mid H=h)
$$

It represents the probability of the observed data $Y=y$ given the hypothesis $H=h$. Importantly, it is a function of $h$ because $y$ is fixed, but it is not a probability distribution since it does not sum to one.

- #statistics.likelihood, #probability-theory.bayes-rule

---

## What is the marginal likelihood in Bayes' rule?

The marginal likelihood, $p(Y=y)$, is computed by marginalizing over the unknown $H$:

$$
p(Y=y)=\sum_{h' \in \mathcal{H}} p(H=h') p(Y=y \mid H=h')
$$

It is necessary to convert the unnormalized joint distribution to a normalized distribution.

- #probability-theory.marginal-likelihood, #statistics.bayesian-inference

---

## Derive the expression for the marginal likelihood in Bayes' rule.

The marginal likelihood is derived by summing over all possible values of the hidden variable $H$:

$$
p(Y=y)=\sum_{h^{\prime} \in \mathcal{H}} p(H=h') p(Y=y \mid H=h') = \sum_{h^{\prime} \in \mathcal{H}} p(H=h', Y = y)
$$

This is necessary for normalizing the joint distribution $p(H=h, Y=y)$.

The violin plots in Figure 2.7 illustrate the following key elements:
- **Kernel density plot**: Shows the probability density of the data at different values, highlighting areas where data points are more concentrated.
- **Box plot elements**: Include the median and interquartile range (IQR).
- **Combined representation**: Offers a more detailed view of the data distribution than the box plot alone.

The violin plots provide more nuanced data insights by revealing the shape of data distribution and the density of occurrences at different data values.

## Explain the calculation involved in normalizing the joint distribution to convert it into a posterior distribution.

To compute the posterior distribution $p(H=h \mid Y=y)$, you normalize the joint distribution $p(H=h, Y=y)$ by the marginal probability $p(Y=y)$ for each $h$. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
p(H=h \mid Y=y) = \frac{p(H=h, Y=y)}{p(Y=y)}
$$

## How is Bayes rule formulated in the context of posterior, prior, and likelihood?

Bayes rule can be simplified in words as:

$$
\text{posterior} \propto \text{prior} \times \text{likelihood}
$$

This proportionality indicates we ignore the normalizing constant independent of $H$. Bayesian inference uses Bayes rule to update a belief about unknown values, given observed data.

## What is the sensitivity (true positive rate) in the context of the COVID-19 diagnostic test, given $H$ (infection state) and $Y$ (test result)?

The sensitivity, denoted as $p(Y=1 \mid H=1)$, is the probability of a positive test given that the person is actually infected.

$$
\text{Sensitivity} = p(Y=1 \mid H=1) = 0.875
$$

- #machine-learning, #healthcare.covid-19

## What is the specificity (true negative rate) in the context of the COVID-19 diagnostic test, given $H$ (infection state) and $Y$ (test result)?

The specificity, denoted as $p(Y=0 \mid H=0)$, is the probability of a negative test given that the person is not infected.

$$
\text{Specificity} = p(Y=0 \mid H=0) = 0.975
$$

- #machine-learning, #healthcare.covid-19

## What does the false positive rate (FPR) denote in the context of diagnostic testing, and how is it calculated using the specificity?

The false positive rate (FPR) is the probability of a positive test result given that the person is not infected, calculated as one minus the specificity:

$$
\text{FPR} = 1 - \text{Specificity} = 1 - 0.975 = 0.025
$$

- #machine-learning, #healthcare.covid-19

## What does the false negative rate (FNR) denote in the context of diagnostic testing, and how is it calculated using the sensitivity?

The false negative rate (FNR) is the probability of a negative test result given that the person is infected, calculated as one minus the sensitivity:

$$
\text{FNR} = 1 - \text{Sensitivity} = 1 - 0.875 = 0.125
$$

- #machine-learning, #healthcare.covid-19
```

## What is the formula to calculate the probability of being infected given a positive test result, $p(H=1 \mid Y=1)$?

The formula for the probability of being infected given a positive test result is:

$$
p(H=1 \mid Y=1) = \frac{\mathrm{TPR} \times \text{prior}}{\mathrm{TPR} \times \text{prior} + \mathrm{FPR} \times (1 - \text{prior})}
$$

Where:
- $\mathrm{TPR}$ is the true positive rate
- $\mathrm{FPR}$ is the false positive rate
- $\text{prior}$ is the prior probability of being infected.

- #probability, #bayes-rule

## Calculate the probability of being infected given a positive test result using TPR = 0.875, FPR = 0.025, and prior = 0.1.

$$
\begin{aligned}
p(H=1 \mid Y=1) & = \frac{\mathrm{TPR} \times \text{prior}}{\mathrm{TPR} \times \text{prior} + \mathrm{FPR} \times (1 - \text{prior})} \\
& = \frac{0.875 \times 0.1}{0.875 \times 0.1 + 0.025 \times 0.9} \\
& = 0.795
\end{aligned}
$$

So, a $79.5\%$ chance you are infected.

- #probability, #bayes-rule

## What is the formula to calculate the probability of being infected given a negative test result, $p(H=1 \mid Y=0)$?

The formula for the probability of being infected given a negative test result is:

$$
p(H=1 \mid Y=0) = \frac{\text{FNR} \times \text{prior}}{\text{FNR} \times \text{prior} + \text{TNR} \times (1 - \text{prior})}
$$

Where:
- $\text{FNR}$ is the false negative rate
- $\text{TNR}$ is the true negative rate
- $\text{prior}$ is the prior probability of being infected.

- #probability, #bayes-rule

## Calculate the probability of being infected given a negative test result using FNR = 0.125, TNR = 0.975, and prior = 0.1.

p(H=1 \mid Y=0) & = \frac{\text{FNR} \times \text{prior}}{\text{FNR} \times \text{prior} + \text{TNR} \times (1 - \text{prior})} \\
& = \frac{0.125 \times 0.1}{0.125 \times 0.1 + 0.975 \times 0.9} \\
& = 0.014
\end{aligned}
$$

So, a $1.4\%$ chance you are infected.

- #probability, #bayes-rule

## What happens to the posterior probabilities if the base rate drops to $1\%$ for both positive and negative tests?

If the base rate (\text{prior}) is $1\%$:
- For a positive test: 

$$
p(H=1 \mid Y=1) = \frac{0.875 \times 0.01}{0.875 \times 0.01 + 0.025 \times 0.99} = 0.26
$$

So, a %%26 chance you are infected.

- For a negative test:

$$
p(H=1 \mid Y=0) = \frac{0.125 \times 0.01}{0.125 \times 0.01 + 0.975 \times 0.99} = 0.0013
$$

So, a 0.13% chance you are infected.

## What does the Monty Hall problem illustrate with respect to Bayes rule?

In the Monty Hall problem, Bayes rule is used to update the probability of winning by switching doors. Initially, the probability is uniformly distributed among the three doors:

$$
P(\text{prize behind door 1}) = P(\text{prize behind door 2}) = P(\text{prize behind door 3}) = \frac{1}{3}
$$

After the host reveals a door without a prize, Bayes rule updates these probabilities, showing that switching doors improves the probability of winning to $\frac{2}{3}$ as opposed to sticking with the initial choice which has a $\frac{1}{3}$ probability.

- #probability, #bayes-rule, #monty-hall

## Should you switch doors in the Monty Hall problem and why?

You should switch doors in the Monty Hall problem because the probability of winning increases to $\frac{2}{3}$ by switching, compared to a $\frac{1}{3}$ chance by sticking with the initial choice. This uses Bayes rule to update the probabilities after the host opens a door.

- #probability, #bayes-rule, #monty-hall


### Card 1

The Monty Hall problem demonstrates a counterintuitive result in probability. Given doors 1, 2, and 3, the host opens one door without revealing the prize. Explain how the probabilities change using Bayes' theorem when initially choosing door 1 and the host opens door 3.

Bayes' theorem helps to update the probability of our hypothesis given new evidence. Here, the priors are:

$$
P\left(H_{1}\right)=P\left(H_{2}\right)=P\left(H_{3}\right)=\frac{1}{3}
$$

When the host opens door 3, we calculate:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P\left(H_{i} \mid Y=3\right)=\frac{P\left(Y=3 \mid H_{i}\right) P\left(H_{i}\right)}{P(Y=3)} \\
& P\left(H_{1} \mid Y=3\right)=\frac{(1 / 2)(1 / 3)}{1 / 2} = \frac{1}{3} \\
& P\left(H_{2} \mid Y=3\right)=\frac{(1)(1 / 3)}{1 / 2} = \frac{2}{3} \\
& P\left(H_{3} \mid Y=3\right)=\frac{(0)(1 / 3)}{1 / 2} = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

The denominator, $P(Y=3)$, is $P(Y=3)=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{2}$.

- #probability, #bayes-theorem, #monty-hall

### Card 2

Given that all doors are initially equally likely, describe the probabilities $P(H_i)$ before any doors are opened.

The initial probabilities, assuming each door has an equal chance of hiding the prize, are:

$$
P\left(H_{1}\right)=P\left(H_{2}\right)=P\left(H_{3}\right)=\frac{1}{3}
$$

These represent an equal likelihood for each hypothesis $H_i$ that the prize is behind door $i$.

- #probability, #hypothesis, #monty-hall

### Card 3

Why does switching doors in the Monty Hall problem increase your odds of winning compared to sticking with your initial choice?

Switching doors increases the winning probability because the host's action of opening a door is dependent on the prize's location. Initially, the probabilities are equal ($P(H_{i}) = \frac{1}{3}$). After the host reveals a goat behind one of the unchosen doors, the probability distribution changes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P\left(H_{1} \mid Y=3\right)=\frac{1}{3} \\
& P\left(H_{2} \mid Y=3\right)=\frac{2}{3} \\
& P\left(H_{3} \mid Y=3\right)=0
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, switching doubles your odds of winning to $\frac{2}{3}$ compared to staying.

- #probability, #decision-theory, #monty-hall

### Card 4

In the context of the Monty Hall problem, define the term "equiprobable a priori" and its significance.

"Equiprobable a priori" means that before any information is revealed, all outcomes are considered equally likely. For the Monty Hall problem:

$$
P\left(H_{1}\right)=P\left(H_{2}\right)=P\left(H_{3}\right)=\frac{1}{3}
$$

This assumption allows us to use Bayes' theorem effectively to update the probabilities when new information (host opening a door) is provided.

- #probability-theory, #prior-probility, #monty-hall

### Card 5

Apply Bayes' theorem to calculate $P\left(H_{2} \mid Y=3\right)$, given the following probabilities: $P\left(H_{2}\right) = \frac{1}{3}$ and $P(Y=3|H_{2}) = 1$.

Using Bayes' theorem:

$$
P\left(H_{i} \mid Y=3\right) = \frac{P\left(Y=3 \mid H_{i}\right) P\left(H_{i}\right)}{P(Y=3)}
$$

Given:

$$
P\left(H_{2}\right) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad P(Y=3|H_{2}) = 1
$$

We calculate:

$$
P\left(H_{2} \mid Y=3\right) = \frac{(1) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{2}{3}
$$

The denominator $P(Y=3)$ was previously found to be $\frac{1}{2}$.

- #bayes-theorem, #conditional-probability, #monty-hall

### Card 6

Describe the thought experiment involving a million doors in the Monty Hall problem and explain how it clarifies the benefit of switching.

In the thought experiment with a million doors, the contestant chooses one door, and the host opens 999,998 doors without revealing the prize, leaving only the contestant's door and one other door closed. Given the small initial probability of $\frac{1}{1,000,000}$ for the chosen door having the prize and the high probability of $\frac{999,999}{1,000,000}$ that it's in the remaining unopened door, switching is clearly advantageous.

This vastly larger scale makes the counterintuitive nature of the original problem more intuitive by highlighting the disparity in probabilities even more starkly.

- #probability, #decision-theory, #monty-hall

## What are the posterior probabilities in the Monty Hall problem when $Y = 3$?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_13_ed018759cfa69e78e314g-1.jpg?height=107&width=887&top_left_y=1176&top_left_x=301)

%

The posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P\left(H_{1} \mid Y=3\right) = \frac{(1/2)(1/3)}{P(Y=3)} = \frac{1/3}{1/2} = \frac{1}{3}, \\
& P\left(H_{2} \mid Y=3\right) = \frac{(1)(1/3)}{P(Y=3)} = \frac{1/3}{1/2} = \frac{2}{3}, \\
& P\left(H_{3} \mid Y=3\right) = \frac{(0)(1/3)}{P(Y=3)} = 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $P(Y=3) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2}$.

Thus, 
$$
\left| P\left(H_{1} \mid Y=3\right) = \frac{1}{3} \right| P\left(H_{2} \mid Y=3\right) = \frac{2}{3}, \left| P\left(H_{3} \mid Y=3\right) = 0.
$$

## Using Bayes' Theorem to evaluate posterior probabilities

What are the posterior probabilities $P\left(H_{1} \mid Y=3\right)$, $P\left(H_{2} \mid Y=3\right)$, and $P\left(H_{3} \mid Y=3\right)$ using Bayes' theorem?

%

From Bayes' theorem:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P\left(H_{i} \mid Y=3\right) &= \frac{P\left(Y=3 \mid H_{i}\right) P\left(H_{i}\right)}{P(Y=3)} \\
P\left(H_{1} \mid Y=3\right) &= \frac{(1/2)(1/3)}{1/2} = \frac{1}{3} \\
P\left(H_{2} \mid Y=3\right) &= \frac{(1)(1/3)}{1/2} = \frac{2}{3} \\
P\left(H_{3} \mid Y=3\right) &= \frac{(0)(1/3)}{1/2} = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

$$
\left|P\left(H_{1} \mid Y=3\right)=\frac{1}{3}\right| \\
P\left(H_{2} \mid Y=3\right)=\frac{2}{3} \\
P\left(H_{3} \mid Y=3\right) = 0
$$

Based on the calculated posterior probabilities, what should the contestant do to maximize their chances of winning the prize in the Monty Hall problem?

%

The contestant should switch to door 2 because the probability $P\left(H_{2} \mid Y=3\right)$ is $\frac{2}{3}$, which is higher than the probability $P\left(H_{1} \mid Y=3\right)$ of $\frac{1}{3}$. Switching doors will give the contestant the highest chance of winning the prize.

## What is the definition of an inverse probability problem, and how does it differ from regular probability problems?

Inverse probability is concerned with inferring the state of the world ($h$) from observations of outcomes ($y$), in contrast to regular probability, which predicts a distribution over outcomes given knowledge about the state of the world.

$$
\text{Regular: } p(y \mid h)
$$
$$
\text{Inverse: } p(h \mid y)
$$

## Consider trying to infer a 3D shape $h$ from a 2D image $y$. What makes this an ill-posed problem, and which figure illustrates this concept?

Inferring a 3D shape $h$ from a 2D image $y$ is an ill-posed problem because there are multiple possible hidden $h$'s consistent with the same observed $y$. This concept is illustrated in Figure 2.8 of the paper.

- #visual-scene-understanding, #ill-posed-problems

## How can Bayes' rule be applied to solve inverse problems? Include the relevant expressions for forward model and prior.

Bayes' rule is applied to solve inverse problems by computing the posterior distribution $p(h \mid y)$, which requires specifying the forward model $p(y \mid h)$ and a prior $p(h)$. 

$$
p(h \mid y) \propto p(y \mid h) p(h)
$$

- #probability-theory, #bayes-rule

## What is the Bernoulli distribution, and how is it used to model binary events? Include the expression for a Bernoulli trial.

The Bernoulli distribution models binary events, such as coin tosses. If $Y=1$ denotes heads and $Y=0$ denotes tails, with $p(Y=1)=\theta$ and $p(Y=0)=1-\theta$, this is expressed as:

$$
Y \sim \operatorname{Ber}(\theta)
$$

- #probability-distributions, #bernoulli-distribution

## Given a coin with a probability $\theta$ of landing heads, what are $p(Y=1)$ and $p(Y=0)$ in a Bernoulli trial?

In a Bernoulli trial for a coin with probability $\theta$ of landing heads:
- $p(Y=1) = \theta$
- $p(Y=0) = 1 - \theta$

- #probability-distributions, #bernoulli-trial

## In the context of inverse problems, what role do the prior $p(h)$ and the forward model $p(y \mid h)$ play in Bayesian inference?

In Bayesian inference for inverse problems:
- The **prior** $p(h)$ represents prior knowledge about the state's distribution.
- The **forward model** $p(y \mid h)$ describes the probability of observing outcomes given the state.

Both are used to compute the posterior distribution $p(h \mid y)$:

$$
p(h \mid y) \propto p(y \mid h) p(h)

Explain the inverse problem illustrated by planar line-drawings in the context of 3-D structure inference.

%

Any planar line-drawing is geometrically consistent with infinitely many three-dimensional (3-D) structures. This means that a 2-D projection of a 3-D object can correspond to multiple possible 3-D shapes. This inverse problem can be approached using probability theory to predict a distribution over possible 3-D outcomes from the given 2-D representation.

How is probability theory applied to solve inverse problems in the context of recovering 3-D structures from 2-D images?

%

Probability theory is used to predict a distribution over outcomes $y$ given knowledge or assumptions about the state of the world, $h$. In the context of recovering 3-D structures from 2-D images, this involves using Bayes' rule to infer the most likely 3-D shape that could result in the observed 2-D projection.

%

A single 2D line-drawing can be consistent with multiple 3D structures because of the inherent ambiguity in projecting a 3D shape onto a 2D surface. Different 3D shapes can produce the same 2D projection when viewed from specific angles. This is a significant challenge in perception and computer vision, an example of an inverse problem where we aim to determine the true 3D shape from its 2D representation.

%

Probability theory, specifically Bayes' rule, is used to predict a distribution over possible outcomes given certain assumptions or knowledge about the state of the world. In the context of inferring 3D structures from 2D projections, probability theory helps to infer the most likely 3D shape by considering all possible 3D shapes that could produce the observed 2D projection and assigning probabilities to each based on prior knowledge and observed data.

## Define the Bernoulli distribution probability mass function (pmf) and express it concisely.

## How is the binomial distribution related to the Bernoulli distribution?

The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution. Specifically, if we observe $N$ Bernoulli trials, the total number of successes $s$ in those trials follows a binomial distribution:

$$

Where $\binom{N}{s}$ is the binomial coefficient, defined as:

Figure 2.9 illustrates the binomial distribution with $N=10$ trials for two different values of probability $\theta$. In graph (a), $\theta=0.25$ shows a distribution peaking around 2 or 3 successes. In graph (b), $\theta=0.9$ shows a distribution that peaks at 9 or 10 successes, reflecting a higher probability of success.

## Write the probability mass function (pmf) for the Bernoulli distribution in two forms.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_13_2a2dfc8685cf6835049eg-1.jpg?height=521&width=1271&top_left_y=191&top_left_x=380)

%

The pmf of the Bernoulli distribution can be written as:

$$
\operatorname{Ber}(y \mid \theta)= \begin{cases}1-\theta & \text { if } y=0 \\ \theta & \text { if } y=1\end{cases}
$$

Alternatively, it can be written more concisely as:

$$
\operatorname{Ber}(y \mid \theta) \triangleq \theta^{y}(1-\theta)^{1-y}
$$

## Define the sigmoid function, $\sigma(a)$, as used in binary logistic regression.

The sigmoid function is defined as follows:

$$ 
\sigma(a) \triangleq \frac{1}{1+e^{-a}} 
$$

This function maps any real-valued number $a$ into the range $[0,1]$, making it particularly useful for binary classification tasks.

- #mathematics, #calculus.sigmoid-function

## What is the derivative of the sigmoid function, $\sigma(x)$?

The derivative of the sigmoid function $\sigma(x)$ is given by:

$$ 
\frac{d}{d x} \sigma(x) = \sigma(x)(1-\sigma(x)) 
$$

This property is crucial in the backpropagation algorithm used for training neural networks.

- #mathematics, #calculus.sigmoid-function

## Explain the relationship between the sigmoid function $\sigma(x)$ and the Heaviside function $\mathbb{I}(a>0)$.

The sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ can be seen as a smooth approximation to the Heaviside step function $\mathbb{I}(a>0)$. The Heaviside function is defined as:

$$
\mathbb{I}(a>0) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } a > 0 \\
0 & \text{if } a \leq 0 
\end{cases}
$$

As $\sigma(a) \approx \mathbb{I}(a>0)$, the sigmoid function can be used to approximate the binary decision process represented by the Heaviside function.

- #mathematics, #activation-functions.heaviside-function

## Derive the inverse of the sigmoid function, known as the logit function.

The inverse of the sigmoid function $\sigma(x)$ is called the logit function and is defined as follows:

$$ 
\sigma^{-1}(p) = \log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) \triangleq \operatorname{logit}(p)
$$

This inversion is useful for transforming probabilities back to the log-odds scale.

- #mathematics, #functions.inverse

## What is the "softplus" function $\sigma_{+}(x)$, and how is it related to the sigmoid function?

The softplus function $\sigma_{+}(x)$ is defined as:

$$ 
\sigma_{+}(x) \triangleq \log \left(1+e^{x}\right) \triangleq \operatorname{softplus}(x) 
$$

The derivative of the softplus function is the sigmoid function:

$$ 
\frac{d}{d x} \sigma_{+}(x) = \sigma(x) 
$$

The softplus function can be considered a smooth approximation to the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function.

- #mathematics, #activation-functions.softplus

## Discuss the use of the sigmoid function in the context of a Bernoulli distribution for binary classification.

In the context of binary classification using a Bernoulli distribution, the probability of output $y$ given input $\boldsymbol{x}$ and parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is modeled as:

$$ 
p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{\theta})=\operatorname{Ber}(y \mid \sigma(f(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})))
$$

Here, $f(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})$ is an unconstrained function predicting the mean parameter of the output distribution, and $\sigma(f(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}))$ ensures the probability lies in the range $[0,1]$.

## Explain the two types of uncertainty discussed in the paper.

The paper discusses two types of uncertainty: epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty.

- Epistemic uncertainty, or model uncertainty, arises from a lack of knowledge and can potentially be reduced by gathering more data.
- Aleatoric uncertainty, or data uncertainty, is intrinsic variability that cannot be reduced by collecting more data.

- #uncertainty.model-uncertainty, #uncertainty.data-uncertainty, #probability

## How does active learning typically handle uncertainty?

In active learning, a typical strategy is to query examples for which $\mathbb{H}(p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x}, \mathcal{D}))$ is large, where $\mathbb{H}(p)$ represents entropy. This entropy can indicate uncertainty about the parameters (epistemic) or inherent variability of the outcome (aleatoric).

$$
\mathbb{H}(p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x}, \mathcal{D})) = - \sum_{y} p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x}, \mathcal{D}) \log p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x}, \mathcal{D})
$$

## Define the probability of an event $A$.

The probability of an event $A$, denoted as $\operatorname{Pr}(A)$, represents the likelihood that event $A$ is true. It must satisfy $0 \leq \operatorname{Pr}(A) \leq 1$. If $ \operatorname{Pr}(A)=0$, the event will not happen, and if $\operatorname{Pr}(A)=1$, the event will definitely occur.

- #probability.definition, #probability.events

## What is the probability of the complement of an event $A$?

The probability of the complement of an event $A$, denoted as $\operatorname{Pr}(\bar{A})$, is defined as:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(\bar{A}) = 1 - \operatorname{Pr}(A)
$$

This indicates that the probability of $A$ not happening is $1$ minus the probability of $A$ happening.

- #probability.complement, #basic-rules

## Write the formula for the probability of the conjunction of two events $A$ and $B$, and explain it.

The probability of the conjunction of two events $A$ and $B$, denoted as $\operatorname{Pr}(A \wedge B)$ or $\operatorname{Pr}(A, B)$, is given by:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(A \wedge B) = \operatorname{Pr}(A) \operatorname{Pr}(B)
$$

if $A$ and $B$ are independent events.

- #probability.conjunction, #rules.independence

## What is the formula for the probability of the union of two events $A$ and $B$?

The probability of the union of two events $A$ and $B$, denoted as $\operatorname{Pr}(A \vee B)$, is given by:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(A \vee B) = \operatorname{Pr}(A) + \operatorname{Pr}(B) - \operatorname{Pr}(A \wedge B)
$$

This formula accounts for the overlap between events $A$ and $B$.

## Explain the sigmoid function and its necessity in logistic regression.
The sigmoid function $ \sigma(a) $ maps the whole real line to $[0,1]$, making it suitable for outputs that can be interpreted as probabilities. Consider the function:

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}
$$

Why is it necessary to map the whole real line to $[0,1]$ in logistic regression, and how is the sigmoid function defined?
%
Mapping the whole real line to $[0,1]$ is necessary for the output to be interpreted as a probability, which makes it a valid value for the Bernoulli parameter $\theta$. The sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ is defined as:

\[
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}
\]

- #machine-learning, #sigmoid-function, #logistic-regression

## Derive the probability expressions for $y = 1$ and $y = 0$ in logistic regression using the sigmoid function.
Derive:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& p(y=1 \mid x, \boldsymbol{\theta})=\sigma(a) \\
& p(y=0 \mid x, \boldsymbol{\theta})=\sigma(-a)
\end{aligned}
$$ 

%
Starting with the sigmoid function:

\[
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}
\]

For $y = 1$:

\[
p(y=1 \mid x, \boldsymbol{\theta})=\frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}} = \sigma(a)
\]

For $y = 0$:

\[
p(y=0 \mid x, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = 1 - \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}} = \frac{e^{-a}}{1 + e^{-a}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{a}} = \sigma(-a)

## Define the Heaviside step function and its relationship to the sigmoid function.
The Heaviside step function $H(a)$ is defined as $ \mathbb{I}(a > 0) $. How does this relate to the sigmoid function?
%
The Heaviside step function $H(a)$ is a function that maps any negative input to 0 and any positive input to 1:

\[
H(a) \triangleq \mathbb{I}(a>0)
\]

The sigmoid function can be considered a "soft" version of the Heaviside step function, smoothly transitioning between 0 and 1 instead of jumping abruptly.

## Explain the log-odds $a$ in the context of logistic regression.
What is $a$ in logistic regression, and how does it relate to the probabilities $p$ and $1-p$?
%
The quantity $a$ is referred to as the log-odds, expressed as:

\[
\log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)
\]

where $p = p(y=1 \mid \boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})$. This relationship is derived as follows:

\[
\log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \log \left( \frac{e^{a}}{1 + e^{a}} \cdot \frac{1 + e^{a}}{1} \right) = \log \left( e^{a} \right) = a

## Describe the relationship between the logistic and logit functions.
Define the logistic (sigmoid) function and its inverse, the logit function.
%
The logistic (or sigmoid) function maps log-odds $a$ to probability $p$:

\[
p = \operatorname{logistic}(a) = \sigma(a) \triangleq \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}
\]

The inverse of the logistic function is the logit function, mapping probability $p$ to log-odds $a$:

\[
a = \operatorname{logit}(p) = \sigma^{-1}(p) \triangleq \log \left( \frac{p}{1 - p} \right)
\]

## Explain the form of the conditional Bernoulli model in binary logistic regression.
Describe the model used in binary logistic regression and define the linear predictor $f(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})$.

In binary logistic regression, a conditional Bernoulli model is used with a linear predictor of the form:

\[
f(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \boldsymbol{w}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x} + b
\]

The model has the form:

\[
p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \operatorname{Ber}\left(y \mid \sigma\left(\boldsymbol{w}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x} + b\right)\right)

### Question 1
What does Figure 2.11 from the logistic regression model applied to a 1-dimensional, 2-class version of the Iris dataset represent, and what are the key features of this graph?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_13_ecbdc63aa9b6dbee5100g-1.jpg?height=344&width=982&top_left_y=218&top_left_x=524)

%

Figure 2.11 represents the application of logistic regression to classify Iris flowers based on petal width. Key features include:

- The horizontal axis represents petal width in centimeters.
- The vertical axis represents the probability of classifying the flower.
- The solid green line indicates the probability of an iris being of the Virginica species.
- The dashed blue line represents the probability of an iris not being of the Virginica species.
- A decision boundary is at approximately 1.7 cm on the petal width axis where the probabilities intersect at 0.5.
- Triangular markers on the top and bottom edges likely represent actual data points, showing their classification according to petal width.

- #logistic-regression, #classification, #iris-dataset

### Question 2
Explain the significance of the decision boundary in logistic regression as shown in Figure 2.11, and what role does petal width play in this context?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_13_ecbdc63aa9b6dbee5100g-1.jpg?height=344&width=982&top_left_y=218&top_left_x=524)

%

The decision boundary in logistic regression, as shown in Figure 2.11, is a critical threshold where the model predicts the probability of an iris being of the Virginica species versus not being Virginica. The decision boundary at approximately 1.7 cm petal width signifies the point where the probabilities for the two classes intersect at 0.5, meaning there's an equal chance of the flower being classified into either category. As petal width deviates from 1.7 cm, the model's confidence in its classification increases, illustrating the impact of petal width on the classification outcome.

### Card 1

**Q: What does the logistic regression plot applied to a 1-dimensional, 2-class version of the Iris dataset show?**

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_13_ecbdc63aa9b6dbee5100g-1.jpg?height=344&width=982&top_left_y=218&top_left_x=524)

%

The logistic regression plot shows the probability of an iris flower being classified as either Virginica or not Virginica based on its petal width. Key elements include:
- Petal width (horizontal axis)
- Probability (vertical axis)
- Solid green curve (probability of being Virginica)
- Dashed blue curve (probability of not being Virginica)
- Vertical dashed line around 1.7 cm representing the decision boundary
- Triangular markers indicating actual data points from the dataset

- #machine-learning, #logistic-regression, #classification.iris-dataset

### Card 2

**Q: What is the significance of the vertical dashed line at approximately 1.7 cm in the logistic regression plot applied to the Iris dataset?**

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_13_ecbdc63aa9b6dbee5100g-1.jpg?height=344&width=982&top_left_y=218&top_left_x=524)

%

The vertical dashed line at approximately 1.7 cm represents the decision boundary where the probability of an iris being classified as Virginica intersects with the probability of it being classified as not Virginica. At this point, the probability for both classes is 0.5. Moving away from this boundary increases the model's confidence in classifying an iris as either Virginica or not Virginica based on petal width.

- #machine-learning, #logistic-regression, #decision-boundary.iris-dataset

## Discuss the formula for the probability in logistic regression.

The formula for the probability in logistic regression is:

$$
p(y=1 \mid \boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})=\sigma\left(\boldsymbol{w}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}+b\right)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-\left(\boldsymbol{w}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}+b\right)}}
$$

## What do the variables $\boldsymbol{w}$, $\boldsymbol{x}$, and $b$ represent in logistic regression?

The variable $\boldsymbol{w}$ represents the weight vector, $\boldsymbol{x}$ is the feature vector, and $b$ is the bias term. These parameters are used to compute the linear combination $\boldsymbol{w}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}+b$, which is then passed through the sigmoid function $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$ to produce the probability.

- #math, #logistic-regression.variables-interpretation

## What is the significance of the decision boundary in logistic regression?

The decision boundary in logistic regression is the value $x^{*}$ where the probability $p(y=1 \mid x=x^{*}, \boldsymbol{\theta})$ equals 0.5. In the given example from the iris dataset, $x^{*} \approx 1.7$. This boundary helps in making classification decisions.

- #math, #logistic-regression.decision-boundary

## Explain why linear regression is inappropriate for binary classification problems.

Linear regression yields probabilities that can exceed 1 or drop below 0 as the feature values move far enough in either direction, which is inappropriate for binary classification. Logistic regression addresses this by ensuring the probabilities stay between 0 and 1 through the sigmoid function.

- #math, #regression.linear-vs-logistic

## Define the categorical distribution and provide its equation.

The categorical distribution is a discrete probability distribution for a finite set of labels $y \in\{1, \ldots, C\}$.

$$
\operatorname{Cat}(y \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}) \triangleq \prod_{c=1}^{C} \theta_{c}^{\mathbb{I}(y=c)}
$$

This means $p(y=c \mid \boldsymbol{\theta})=\theta_{c}$, where the parameters are constrained by $0 \leq \theta_{c} \leq 1$ and $\sum_{c=1}^{C} \theta_{c}=1$.

- #probability, #distributions.categorical

## How can we represent the categorical distribution using a one-hot vector?

We can represent the categorical distribution using a one-hot vector $\boldsymbol{y}$, where $y_{c}$ denotes the presence of class $c$ (1 if present, 0 otherwise).

$$
\operatorname{Cat}(\boldsymbol{y} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}) \triangleq \prod_{c=1}^{C} \theta_{c}^{y_{c}}
$$

This helps in encoding class labels for easier mathematical manipulation.

- #probability, #distributions.one-hot-encoding 

## What is the relationship between the categorical distribution and multinomial distribution?

The categorical distribution is a special case of the multinomial distribution. Suppose we observe $N$ categorical trials $y_{n} \sim \operatorname{Cat}(\cdot \mid \boldsymbol{\theta})$ for $n=1:N$, it leads to the vector $\boldsymbol{y}$ which counts the occurrences of each class.

$$
\operatorname{Cat}(\boldsymbol{y} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}) \triangleq \prod_{c=1}^{C} \theta_{c}^{y_{c}} \text{ for one trial}
$$

## How does temperature affect the softmax distribution for the input vector $\boldsymbol{a}=(3,0,1)$?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_13_0d3c3fabafab878573b2g-1.jpg?height=362&width=941&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=545)

%

The effect of temperature on the softmax distribution of the input vector $\boldsymbol{a}=(3,0,1)$ is as follows:

- **High Temperature ($T=100$)**: The distribution is almost uniform, indicating that all classes have similar probabilities. The high temperature makes the softmax function less sensitive to differences in the input scores.
- **Moderate Temperature ($T=2$)**: The distribution reflects greater differentiation among the classes. The class with the highest input score (logit of 3) has a higher probability, but the probabilities are still relatively smooth.
- **Low Temperature ($T=1$)**: The distribution exhibits a "winner-takes-all" behavior, with the highest input score class receiving most of the probability mass. 

Each graph demonstrates that lower temperatures make the softmax function behave more like the argmax function.

Explain the effect of temperature $T$ on the softmax distribution $\operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{a} / T)$ for the input vector $\boldsymbol{a} = (3, 0, 1)$ as shown in the figure.

%

The figure shows the softmax distribution $\operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{a} / T)$ at three different temperatures ($T = 100$, $T = 2$, and $T = 1$):

- At $T = 100$: The distribution is almost uniform because the high temperature diminishes the differences in input scores, making the output probabilities similar for all classes.

- At $T = 2$: The distribution shows more variance, with the class corresponding to the highest input score having a higher probability. This demonstrates a moderate sensitivity to differences in input scores.

- At $T = 1$: The distribution is "spiky" with the highest probability mass concentrated on the class with the highest input score. This low temperature emphasizes the input differences strongly, leading to a near "winner-takes-all" behavior. 

These examples illustrate that increasing the temperature smooths the distribution, while decreasing it makes the distribution more sensitive to the input score differences.

- At high temperature ($T = 100$): The softmax function produces a nearly uniform distribution, assigning similar probabilities to all classes, effectively neutralizing the effect of the input score differences.

- At low temperature ($T = 1$): The softmax function has a "spiky" distribution, heavily favoring the class with the highest input score, showcasing a strong sensitivity to the input score differences and resembling a "winner-takes-all" scenario.

- tags: #machine-learning, #softmax-function, #temperature-sensitivity

## What transformation does the softmax function perform over its inputs?

The softmax function maps $\mathbb{R}^{C}$ to $[0, 1]^{C}$, ensuring that $0 \leq \operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{a})_{c} \leq 1$ and $\sum_{c=1}^{C} \operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{a})_{c} = 1$.

- #machine-learning, #logistic-regression, #softmax-function

## How does the softmax function behave as the temperature $T$ approaches zero?

The softmax function behaves as follows when the temperature $T$ approaches zero:

$$
\operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{a} / T)_{c} = \begin{cases}1.0 & \text { if } c=\operatorname{argmax}_{c^{\prime}} a_{c^{\prime}} \\ 0.0 & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}
$$

As $T \rightarrow 0$, the distribution concentrates most of its probability mass in the most probable state (winner takes all).

## What is the final model for multiclass logistic regression using a linear predictor?

The final model for multiclass logistic regression using a linear predictor $f(\boldsymbol{x}; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathbf{W} \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{b}$ becomes:

$$
p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x}; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \operatorname{Cat}(y \mid \operatorname{softmax}(\mathbf{W} \boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{b}))
$$

- #machine-learning, #logistic-regression, #multiclass

## How can the probability $p(y=c \mid \boldsymbol{x}; \boldsymbol{\theta})$ for multinomial logistic regression be written in terms of logits $\boldsymbol{a}$?

For multinomial logistic regression, the probability can be written as:

$$
p(y=c \mid \boldsymbol{x}; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \frac{e^{a_{c}}}{\sum_{c^{\prime}=1}^{C} e^{a_{c^{\prime}}}}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{a} = \mathbf{W} \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{b}$.

- #machine-learning, #logistic-regression, #multinomial

## Under what condition does multinomial logistic regression reduce to binary logistic regression?

Multinomial logistic regression reduces to binary logistic regression if there are only two classes ($C = 2$). The softmax function for two classes simplifies as follows:

$$
\operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{a})_{0} = \frac{e^{a_{0}}}{e^{a_{0}} + e^{a_{1}}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{a_{1} - a_{0}}} = \sigma(a_{0} - a_{1})
$$

Thus, we can train the model to predict $a = a_{1} - a_{0}$.

- #machine-learning, #logistic-regression, #binary

## Why is a model using two weight vectors $\boldsymbol{w}_{0}$ and $\boldsymbol{w}_{1}$ considered over-parameterized in binary logistic regression?

Using two weight vectors $\boldsymbol{w}_{0}$ and $\boldsymbol{w}_{1}$ in binary logistic regression is considered over-parameterized because:

$$
\sigma(a_{0} - a_{1})
$$

can be learned using just a single weight vector $\boldsymbol{w}$. The use of two weight vectors (one per class) can lead to redundant parameters, which may hurt interpretability, even though the predictions will remain the same.

What does the scatter plot with decision boundaries in the image represent?

%

The scatter plot with decision boundaries represents multinomial logistic regression applied to a 3-class, 2-feature version of the Iris dataset. The horizontal axis marks the petal length, and the vertical axis shows the petal width. The plot depicts three Iris species:

- **Iris Virginica**: Green triangles
- **Iris Versicolor**: Yellow circles
- **Iris Setosa**: Blue squares

The background gradient and contour lines indicate class probabilities across the feature space. The decision boundaries highlight the regions where the logistic regression model classifies the Iris species. Key observations include a clear separation between Iris Setosa and the other species, and a slight overlap between Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor, illustrating classification ambiguities based on these features.

Explain the mathematical properties of the softmax function used in multinomial logistic regression, as depicted in the image from the Iris dataset.

%

The softmax function transforms a vector $\mathbf{a}$ from $\mathbb{R}^{C}$ to $[0, 1]^{C}$ and adheres to two key properties:

1. $0 \leq \operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{a})_{c} \leq 1$ for each class $c$.
2. The sum of the probabilities for all classes equals 1, i.e., $\sum_{c=1}^{C} \operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{a})_{c} = 1$.

The function is defined as:

$$
\operatorname{softmax}(\mathbf{a})_{c} = \frac{e^{a_c}}{\sum_{k=1}^{C} e^{a_k}}
$$

This ensures that the output probabilities share mutual exclusivity and exhaustive completeness, key for multinomial logistic regression. In the context of the Iris dataset, these principles ensure each prediction reflects a well-calibrated probability distribution across the three classes.

## What does the logistic regression shown in the image represent in terms of the Iris dataset?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_13_855eab66de586ca6078dg-1.jpg?height=367&width=554&top_left_y=207&top_left_x=733)

%

The logistic regression shown in the image represents a 3-class, 2-feature classification on the Iris dataset. The horizontal axis represents petal length, and the vertical axis represents petal width. The different shapes and colors indicate the three species of Iris flowers:

- Green triangles represent Iris Virginica.
- Yellow circles represent Iris Versicolor.
- Blue squares represent Iris Setosa.

The background gradient and contour lines indicate the probabilities associated with each class, with the boundaries showing where the model's predicted probabilities for the different classes are equal. This results in linear decision boundaries, showing where the logistic regression model changes its classification from one species to another. The plot highlights that Iris Setosa is well-separated from the other two species, while there is some overlap between Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor.

## What are the mathematical constraints satisfied by the softmax function as depicted in the logistic regression image?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_13_855eab66de586ca6078dg-1.jpg?height=367&width=554&top_left_y=207&top_left_x=733)

%

The softmax function maps $\mathbb{R}^{C}$ to $[0,1]^{C}$ and satisfies the following constraints:

$$
0 \leq \operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{a})_{c} \leq 1 \quad \text{for all} \; c
$$

and

$$
\sum_{c=1}^{C} \operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{a})_{c} = 1
$$

This ensures that the output of the softmax function constitutes valid probability distributions over the $C$ classes.

```markdown
## What is the normalized probability expression $p_c$ in the softmax distribution?

The normalized probability $p_c$ in the softmax distribution is given by:

$$
p_{c} = \frac{e^{a_{c}}}{Z(\boldsymbol{a})}
$$

where

$$
Z(\boldsymbol{a}) = \sum_{c^{\prime}=1}^{C} e^{a_{c^{\prime}}}
$$

In this context, $\boldsymbol{a} = f(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})$ are the logits.

- #machine-learning, #softmax-distribution, #normalization

## What is the purpose of the log-sum-exp (LSE) trick?

The log-sum-exp (LSE) trick is used to avoid numerical problems when computing the partition function $Z$, especially with large or small logits. The LSE trick is expressed as:

$$
\log \sum_{c=1}^{C} \exp \left(a_{c}\right) = m+\log \sum_{c=1}^{C} \exp \left(a_{c}-m\right)
$$

where $m = \max_{c} a_{c}$ ensures that the largest value exponentiated will be zero.

- #machine-learning, #log-sum-exp, #numerical-stability

## How is the LSE function implemented?

The LSE function is defined as:

$$
\operatorname{lse}(\boldsymbol{a}) \triangleq \log \sum_{c=1}^{C} \exp \left(a_{c}\right)
$$

This transformation helps maintain numerical stability by reducing the chance of overflow or underflow.

- #machine-learning, #log-sum-exp, #function-implementation

## How do we compute probabilities from logits using the LSE trick?

Using the LSE trick, probabilities from logits can be computed as:

$$
p(y=c \mid \boldsymbol{x}) = \exp \left(a_{c} - \operatorname{lse}(\boldsymbol{a})\right)
$$

This methodology ensures numerical stability while converting logits to probabilities.

- #machine-learning, #logits, #probability-computation

## What is the cross-entropy loss formula $\mathcal{L}$ for one example in binary classification?

The cross-entropy loss $\mathcal{L}$ for one example in binary classification is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L} = - \left[\mathbb{I}(y=0) \log p_{0} + \mathbb{I}(y=1) \log p_{1} \right]
$$

where $\mathbb{I}$ is the indicator function.

- #machine-learning, #cross-entropy-loss, #binary-classification

## How can the log probabilities $\log p_1$ and $\log p_0$ be expressed in terms of logits for numerical stability?

The log probabilities $\log p_1$ and $\log p_0$ in terms of logits can be written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \log p_{1} = \log \left(\frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)}\right) = -\operatorname{lse}([0, -a]) \\
& \log p_{0} = -\operatorname{lse}([0, a])
\end{aligned}

## Define the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a continuous random variable $Y$.

The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a continuous random variable $Y$ is defined as:

$$
P(y) \triangleq \operatorname{Pr}(Y \leq y)
$$

This function is useful for computing the probability that $Y$ falls within any specific interval $(a, b]$:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(a<Y \leq b)=P(b)-P(a)
$$

Cdf's are monotonically non-decreasing functions, meaning they either increase or remain constant as $y$ increases.

- #probability, #statistics.cdf

## What is the cdf of the Gaussian distribution?

The cdf of the Gaussian distribution $\Phi(y; \mu, \sigma^2)$ is defined by:

$$
\Phi\left(y ; \mu, \sigma^{2}\right) \triangleq \int_{-\infty}^{y} \mathcal{N}\left(z \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right) d z
$$

An alternative implementation uses the error function, $\operatorname{erf}(u)$:

$$
\Phi\left(y ; \mu, \sigma^{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 + \operatorname{erf} \left( \frac{y - \mu}{\sigma \sqrt{2}} \right) \right]
$$

where 

$$
\operatorname{erf}(u) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{0}^{u} e^{-t^{2}} d t
$$

- #probability, #statistics.gaussian

## Describe the error function $\operatorname{erf}(u)$.

The error function $\operatorname{erf}(u)$ is defined as:

$$
\operatorname{erf}(u) \triangleq \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{0}^{u} e^{-t^{2}} d t
$$

It is used in various statistical computations, including the cdf of the Gaussian distribution:

$$
\Phi\left(y ; \mu, \sigma^{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 + \operatorname{erf} \left( \frac{y - \mu}{\sigma \sqrt{2}} \right) \right]
$$

The error function quantifies the probability that a random variable with a normal distribution falls within a certain range.

- #error-function, #statistics.gaussian

## What is the $q^{th}$ quantile of $P$, and what is it used for?

If $P$ is the cdf of $Y$, then $P^{-1}(q)$ is the value $y_q$ such that:

$$
p\left(Y \leq y_{q}\right) = q
$$

This is called the $q^{\prime}$-th quantile of $P$. Quantiles are used to divide the probability distribution into intervals with equal probabilities. For example, the median of the distribution is $P^{-1}(0.5)$, which has half of the probability mass on the left and half on the right.

- #probability, #statistics.quantiles

## How is the central interval for the normal distribution defined?

For a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, the central interval containing $1-\alpha$ of the mass is given by:

$$
\left(\Phi^{-1}(\alpha / 2), \Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha / 2)\right)
$$

For example, setting $\alpha = 0.05$ gives:

$$
\left(\Phi^{-1}(0.025), \Phi^{-1}(0.975)\right) = (-1.96, 1.96)
$$

This interval contains $95\%$ of the probability mass.

- #statistics, #probability.central-interval

## What is the $95\%$ interval for a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$?

For a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}\left(\mu, \sigma^{2}\right)$, the $95\%$ central interval is:

$$
(\mu - 1.96 \sigma, \mu + 1.96 \sigma)
$$

This interval contains $95\%$ of the probability mass and is often approximated as $\mu \pm 2 \sigma$.

- #statistics, #probability.gaussian-interval

Here are six Anki-style cards based on the provided chunk of the paper:

## What is the probability density function (pdf) and how is it related to the cumulative distribution function (cdf)?

The pdf is defined as the derivative of the cdf:

$$
p(y) \triangleq \frac{d}{d y} P(y)
$$

The cdf, $P(y)$, is the integral of the pdf from $-\infty$ to $y$.

- #statistics, #probability.cdf-pdf-relationship

## How is the pdf of a Gaussian distribution represented mathematically?

For a Gaussian distribution, the pdf is given by:

$$
\mathcal{N}\left(y \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right) \triangleq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^{2}}} e^{-\frac{1}{2 \sigma^{2}}(y-\mu)^{2}}
$$

where $\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^{2}}$ is the normalization constant.

- #statistics, #probability.gaussian-pdf

## How do you compute the probability of a continuous variable being in a finite interval using the pdf?

Given a pdf $p(y)$, the probability of a continuous variable $Y$ being in a finite interval $(a, b]$ is computed as:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(a<Y \leq b)=\int_{a}^{b} p(y) d y = P(b) - P(a)
$$

where $P(y)$ is the cdf.

- #statistics, #probability.probability-interval

## What is the expected value (mean) of a distribution and how is it computed using the pdf?

The expected value or mean of a distribution is computed using the pdf as follows:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y] \triangleq \int_{\mathcal{Y}} y p(y) d y
$$

For a Gaussian distribution, $\mathbb{E}\left[\mathcal{N}\left(\cdot \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right)\right] = \mu$.

- #statistics, #probability.expected-value

## How is the variance of a distribution defined and computed using the pdf? What is the relationship between the second moment and the variance?

The variance of a distribution, $\mathbb{V}[Y]$, is defined as:

$$
\mathbb{V}[Y] \triangleq \mathbb{E}\left[(Y-\mu)^{2}\right] = \int (y-\mu)^{2} p(y) d y
$$

It can be reformulated as:

$$
\mathbb{V}[Y] = \mathbb{E}\left[Y^{2}\right] - \mu^{2}
$$

From which we derive:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[Y^{2}\right] = \sigma^{2} + \mu^{2}
$$

- #statistics, #probability.variance-computation

## What is the standard deviation and how is it related to the variance?

The standard deviation of a distribution is defined as:

$$
\operatorname{std}[Y] \triangleq \sqrt{\mathbb{V}[Y]} = \sigma
$$

The standard deviation is often more interpretable than the variance since it has the same units as $Y$. For a Gaussian distribution, $\operatorname{std}\left[\mathcal{N}\left(\cdot \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right)\right] = \sigma$.

- #statistics, #probability.standard-deviation

```markdown
## What is a homoscedastic regression in the context of linear regression?

Homoscedastic regression is a scenario where the variance $\sigma^2$ of the model's output $y$ is fixed and independent of the input vector $\mathbf{x}$. The probability density function for this model is given by:

$$
p(y \mid \mathbf{x}; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathcal{N}(y \mid \mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x} + b, \sigma^2)
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\mathbf{w}, b, \sigma^2)$.

- #statistics.regression, #probability.gaussian-distribution

## Explain the structure of the conditional density model in regression.

The conditional density model in regression is expressed as:

$$
p(y \mid \mathbf{x}; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathcal{N}\left(y \mid f_{\mu}(\mathbf{x}; \boldsymbol{\theta}), f_{\sigma}(\mathbf{x}; \boldsymbol{\theta})^2\right)
$$

where $f_{\mu}(\mathbf{x}; \boldsymbol{\theta}) \in \mathbb{R}$ predicts the mean value and $f_{\sigma}(\mathbf{x}; \boldsymbol{\theta})^2 \in \mathbb{R}_+$ predicts the variance. This allows the model to adapt the mean and variance based on input $\mathbf{x}$.

- #statistics.regression, #probability.gaussian-distribution

## How does heteroscedastic regression differ from homoscedastic regression?

In heteroscedastic regression, the variance can vary with the input $\mathbf{x}$. The model is represented as:

$$
p(y \mid \mathbf{x}; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathcal{N}\left(y \mid \mathbf{w}_{\mu}^{\top} \mathbf{x} + b, \sigma_{+}(\mathbf{w}_{\sigma}^{\top} \mathbf{x})\right)
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\mathbf{w}_{\mu}, \mathbf{w}_{\sigma})$, and $\sigma_{+}(a) = \log(1 + e^a)$ is the softplus function ensuring non-negative variance.

- #statistics.regression, #probability.gaussian-distribution

## What does Figure 2.14 illustrate about linear regression with Gaussian output?

Figure 2.14 illustrates two scenarios of linear regression with Gaussian output:
1. Homoscedastic regression with a fixed variance $\sigma^2$, as shown in (a).
2. Heteroscedastic regression with input-dependent variance $\sigma(x)^2$, as shown in (b).

These demonstrate how variance can either remain constant or change based on input $\mathbf{x}$.

- #statistics.regression, #visualization

## What does the $95\%$ predictive interval represent in the context of the regression model?

The $95\%$ predictive interval, denoted as $[\mu(x)-2\sigma(x), \mu(x)+2\sigma(x)]$, represents the uncertainty in the predicted observation $y$ given $\mathbf{x}$. This interval captures the variability in the observations (blue dots in the graph) around the predicted mean $\mu(x)$.

- #statistics.regression, #probability.confidence-interval

## Why is the softplus function $\sigma_{+}(a) = \log(1 + e^a)$ used in heteroscedastic regression?

The softplus function, defined as $\sigma_{+}(a) = \log(1 + e^a)$, maps real numbers from $\mathbb{R}$ to non-negative real numbers $\mathbb{R}_{+}$, ensuring that the predicted standard deviation in the heteroscedastic model is always non-negative.

## How does the concept of homoscedasticity relate to linear regression as shown in the image?

% 

In the context of linear regression, homoscedasticity refers to the assumption that the variance of the errors or residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variable. In the image, this is illustrated by the two parallel green lines around the red regression line, which do not change in width as they extend along the x-axis. This implies that the spread or variability of the data points around the regression line is uniform throughout.

The Gaussian conditional density model in regression is given by:

$$
p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})=\mathcal{N}\left(y \mid f_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}), f_{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})^{2}\right)
$$

Here, $f_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})$ predicts the mean, and $f_{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})^{2}$ predicts the variance. This model allows the regression to account for varying degrees of uncertainty in predictions, making it possible to model input-dependent variances (heteroscedasticity) in addition to the mean relationship.

Explain the concept demonstrated by the following regression model.

% 

The image demonstrates linear regression with homoskedastic error variance, meaning the variance of the prediction errors is constant across all levels of the independent variable $x$. The solid red line represents the mean function $\mu(x) = b + wx$. The parallel green lines depict the predictive interval, typically $\mu(x) \pm 2\sigma$, indicating the variability or uncertainty in the prediction due to the Gaussian noise with fixed variance $\sigma^2$. This interval suggests that approximately 95% of the observed data falls within the interval, assuming normally distributed errors.

**Conditional Density Model for Regression**

What is the form of the conditional density model used for regression? Define the predicted mean and variance in terms of input variables.

%

The conditional density model used for regression is:

$$
p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathcal{N}\left(y \mid f_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}), f_{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})^{2}\right)
$$

Here:

- $f_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}) \in \mathbb{R}$ predicts the mean of the distribution,
- $f_{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})^{2} \in \mathbb{R}_{+}$ predicts the variance which can be input-dependent.

This model allows the parameters of the Gaussian to be functions of the input variables, thus accommodating heteroscedasticity or varying variances depending on the input $ \boldsymbol{x}$.

Figure 2.14 demonstrates linear regression using Gaussian output. The plots show the mean $\mu(x)=b + wx$ with (a) fixed variance $\sigma^2$ (homoskedastic) and (b) input-dependent variance $\sigma(x)^2$ (heteroscedastic). In the homoskedastic case, the variance is constant, while in the heteroscedastic case, the variance changes with the input $x$.

$$
p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})=\mathcal{N}\left(y \mid f_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}), f_{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})^{2}\right)
$$

where $f_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})$ predicts the mean, and $f_{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})^2$ predicts the variance. This allows the Gaussian parameters to be functions of input variables $\boldsymbol{x}$, making it a conditional density model.

Explain the concept of heteroscedasticity in linear regression as illustrated in the given image.

%

In heteroscedasticity, the variance of the errors is not constant across all levels of the independent variables. This is depicted in the image where the variance $\sigma(x)^2$ is a function of $x$, indicating that the spread of the data points around the regression line changes with $x$. This contrasts with homoskedasticity, where the variance $\sigma^2$ is fixed and does not depend on $x$.

## Why is the Gaussian distribution so widely used in statistics and machine learning?

The Gaussian distribution is widely used due to several reasons: it has two easily interpretable parameters (mean and variance), it is supported by the central limit theorem for sums of independent random variables, it has maximum entropy given its mean and variance constraints, and it provides a simple mathematical form that simplifies implementation.

- #probability, #statistics, #machine-learning

## What are the parameters of a Gaussian distribution?

The parameters of a Gaussian distribution are:

- Mean ($\mu$)
- Variance ($\sigma^2$)

These parameters are crucial for describing the distribution's basic properties.

$$
\mathcal{N}(x \mid \mu, \sigma^{2})
$$

- #probability, #statistics, #machine-learning

## Explain the central limit theorem's relevance to the Gaussian distribution.

The central limit theorem states that the sum of a large number of independent random variables, each with finite mean and variance, will approximate a Gaussian distribution. This validates the Gaussian distribution as a model for residual errors or "noise".

- #probability, #statistics.central-limit-theorem

## What characterizes the maximum entropy property of the Gaussian distribution?

The Gaussian distribution has the maximum entropy for a distribution with a specified mean and variance. This makes it a good default choice when minimal assumptions about the data are desired.

## What is the Dirac delta function, and how is it related to the Gaussian distribution as variance approaches zero?

As the variance of a Gaussian distribution approaches zero, it becomes an infinitely narrow and tall spike at the mean. This limiting behavior is represented by the Dirac delta function:

$$
\lim _{\sigma \rightarrow 0} \mathcal{N}\left(y \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right) \rightarrow \delta(y-\mu)
$$

where the Dirac delta function $\delta(x)$ is defined by:

$$
\delta(x)= 
\begin{cases} 
+\infty & \text { if } x=0 \\ 
0 & \text { if } x \neq 0 
\end{cases},
\qquad
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(x) \, dx = 1
$$

## Define the variant $\delta_y(x)$ of the Dirac delta function and its relationship with $\delta(x-y)$.

A variant of the Dirac delta function, $\delta_y(x)$, is defined as:

$$
\delta_{y}(x)= 
\begin{cases} 
+\infty & \text { if } x=y \\ 
0 & \text { if } x \neq y 
\end{cases}
$$

This function is equivalent to:

$$
\delta_{y}(x) = \delta(x-y)

## Write the pdf of the Student's $t$-distribution and define its parameters.

The pdf of the Student's $t$-distribution is given by:

$$
\mathcal{T}\left(y \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}, \nu\right) \propto \left[1 + \frac{1}{\nu}\left(\frac{y - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}\right]^{-\left(\frac{\nu + 1}{2}\right)}

## Explain the sensitivity of the Gaussian distribution to outliers and an alternative distribution.

The Gaussian distribution is quite sensitive to outliers. A robust alternative to the Gaussian distribution is the Student's $t$-distribution, which has heavier tails and is less influenced by outliers.

### How are the behaviors of Gaussian, Student's t-distributions (with $\nu = 1$ and $\nu = 2$), and the Laplace distribution different as shown in the pdf plot?

%

In chart (a), the Gaussian distribution, Laplace distribution, and Student's t-distributions are compared. The tails of the Student's t-distributions are heavier than those of the Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Specifically:
- The Gaussian ($\mathcal{N}(0,1)$) is denoted by a dotted line.
- The Student's t-distribution with $\nu=1$ (equivalent to a Cauchy distribution) is shown with dashed lines.
- The Student's t-distribution with $\nu=2$ is shown with dot-dashed lines.
- The Laplace distribution $(0, 1/\sqrt{2})$ is represented as a solid line.

This illustrates the Gaussian distribution having lighter tails compared to the Student's t-distributions, which implies that the latter assigns more probability to extreme events, making them potentially more robust to outliers.

### What is the effect of the logarithmic transformation on the probability density functions as shown in the log-pdf plot?

%

In chart (b), the log-pdfs are plotted, showing the logarithmic transformation of the distributions. This emphasizes the tails of the distributions, highlighting differences more clearly:
- The Gaussian distribution appears as a smooth curve, revealing its faster decay rate in the tails compared to other distributions.
- The Student's t-distribution with $\nu=1$ (Cauchy), shown with dashed lines, and $\nu=2$, with dot-dashed lines, illustrate heavier tails.
- The Laplace distribution exhibits tails heavier than the Gaussian but lighter than the Student's t-distributions.

The log-pdf representation demonstrates that the Student's t-distributions assign higher probabilities to extreme values, emphasizing their robustness to outliers.

Compare and contrast the distributional properties of the Gaussian, Student's t-distribution (for \(\nu=1\) and \(\nu=2\)), and Laplace distributions as shown in Figure 2.15(a).

In Figure 2.15(a), the shapes of the distributions are compared with the following properties:

- **Gaussian Distribution \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\)**: A dotted line, symmetrical about the mean (0) with light tails.
- **Student's t-Distribution \(\mathcal{T}(\mu=0, \sigma=1, \nu=1)\)**: A dashed line, heavier tails compared to Gaussian, equivalent to the Cauchy distribution.
- **Student's t-Distribution \(\mathcal{T}(\mu=0, \sigma=1, \nu=2)\)**: A dot-dashed line, also heavier tails but less so than \(\nu=1\).
- **Laplace Distribution \((0,1/\sqrt{2})\)**: A solid line, resembles an exponential distribution on each side of the mean, with sharper peak and heavier tails than Gaussian, but different structure from Student's t-distributions.

What does the logarithmic transformation of the probability density functions (Figure 2.15(b)) reveal about the tails of the Gaussian, Student's t-distributions, and Laplace distributions?

%
In Figure 2.15(b), the log-pdfs highlight the following:

- **Gaussian Distribution \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\)**: Demonstrates light, exponentially decaying tails.
- **Student's t-Distribution \(\mathcal{T}(\mu=0, \sigma=1, \nu=1)\)**: Shows very heavy tails (logarithmic view underlines its power-law tails), implying higher likelihood of extreme values.
- **Student's t-Distribution \(\mathcal{T}(\mu=0, \sigma=1, \nu=2)\)**: Also displays heavy tails, but less extreme than \(\nu=1\).
- **Laplace Distribution \((0,1/\sqrt{2})\)**: Exhibits exponential tails, heavier than Gaussian but lighter compared to Student's t-distributions.

These comparisons emphasize the robustness of the Student's t-distributions to outliers due to heavier tails, contrasted with the Gaussian and Laplace distributions.

## Given two mutually exclusive events A and B, what is the probability of either A or B occurring?

If the events are mutually exclusive (so they cannot happen at the same time), we get

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(A \vee B)=\operatorname{Pr}(A)+\operatorname{Pr}(B)
$$

For example, suppose $X$ is chosen uniformly at random from the set $\{1,2,3,4\}$. Let $A$ be the event that $X \in\{1,2\}$ and $B$ be the event that $X \in\{3\}$. Then we have

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(A \vee B)=\frac{2}{4}+\frac{1}{4}
$$.

- #probability.mutually-exclusive, #probability.basic-rules
  
## What is the definition of conditional probability of event B given event A?

The conditional probability of event $B$ happening given that $A$ has occurred is given by:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(B \mid A) \triangleq \frac{\operatorname{Pr}(A, B)}{\operatorname{Pr}(A)}
$$

This is not defined if $\operatorname{Pr}(A)=0$, since we cannot condition on an impossible event.

- #probability.conditional-probability, #probability.basic-rules

## How is independence of events A and B defined?

Event $A$ is independent of event $B$ if

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(A, B)=\operatorname{Pr}(A) \operatorname{Pr}(B)
$$

- #probability.independence, #probability.basic-rules

## What is the definition of conditional independence of events A and B given event C?

Events $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given event $C$ if

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(A, B \mid C)=\operatorname{Pr}(A \mid C) \operatorname{Pr}(B \mid C)
$$

This is written as $A \perp B \mid C$.

- #probability.conditional-independence, #probability.basic-rules

## What is a random variable (rv) and what is the sample space or state space?

A random variable represents some unknown quantity of interest, such as the outcome of a dice roll, denoted as $X$. The set of possible values, denoted $\mathcal{X}$, is known as the sample space or state space. For example, if $X$ represents the face of a dice that is rolled, so $\mathcal{X}=\{1,2, \ldots, 6\}$, then different events can be:

- Seeing a 1: $X=1$
- Seeing an odd number: $X \in\{1,3,5\}$
- Seeing a number between 1 and 3: $1 \leq X \leq 3$

- #random-variables.definition, #probability.sample-space

## What are discrete random variables and how is the probability of a discrete event denoted?

If the sample space $\mathcal{X}$ is finite or countably infinite, then $X$ is called a discrete random variable. In this case, we denote the probability of the event that $X$ has value $x$ by $\operatorname{Pr}(X=x)$.

- #random-variables.discrete, #probability.discrete-events

## Discuss the effect of outliers on fitting Gaussian, Student, and Laplace distributions as illustrated in the paper.

The provided figure demonstrates how outliers impact Gaussian, Student, and Laplace distributions. Specifically:

- (a) Without outliers, the Gaussian and Student distributions are nearly indistinguishable.
- (b) With outliers, the Gaussian distribution is significantly affected, while the Student and Laplace distributions show greater robustness.

$$\text { mean }=\mu, \text { mode }=\mu, \operatorname{var}=\frac{\nu \sigma^{2}}{(\nu-2)}$$

- #statistics, #outliers.impact

## Explain why the Student distribution is more robust to outliers compared to the Gaussian distribution.

The Student distribution is more robust to outliers because its probability density function (pdf) decays as a polynomial function of the squared distance from the center. In contrast, the Gaussian distribution's pdf decays exponentially. This slower decay means more probability mass in the tails, making the Student distribution less sensitive to outliers.

$$\text { mean }=\mu, \text { mode }=\mu, \operatorname{var}=\frac{\nu \sigma^{2}}{(\nu-2)}$$

- #statistics, #robustness.student-distribution

## Describe the conditions under which the variance of the Student distribution is defined and explain its robustness properties.

The variance of the Student distribution is defined only if $\nu > 2$. The distribution is robust to outliers due to its heavy tails, which decay polynomially rather than exponentially. For $\nu \gg 5$, the Student distribution approximates a Gaussian distribution and loses its robustness properties.

$$\operatorname{var}=\frac{\nu \sigma^{2}}{(\nu-2)}$$

- #statistics, #variance.student-distribution

## What happens to the Student distribution as the degrees of freedom (\nu) increases significantly (e.g., \nu \gg 5)?

As the degrees of freedom $\nu$ increase significantly (e.g., $\nu \gg 5$), the Student distribution rapidly approaches a Gaussian distribution and loses its robustness properties against outliers. This is because the heavy tails become less pronounced, making it behave more like a Gaussian distribution.

- #statistics, #degrees.of-freedom.effect

## Define the Cauchy distribution and explain its key characteristics.

The Cauchy distribution, also known as the Lorentz distribution, is defined by:

$$
\mathcal{C}(x \mid \mu, \gamma)=\frac{1}{\gamma \pi}\left[1+\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\gamma}\right)^{2}\right]^{-1}
$$

Key characteristics include:

- Very heavy tails compared to a Gaussian distribution.
- The integral that defines the mean does not converge, highlighting its extremely heavy tails.
- $95\%$ of values from a standard Cauchy distribution lie between -12.7 and 12.7, compared to -1.96 and 1.96 for a standard normal distribution.

- #probability.distribution, #cauchy-distribution

## What happens to the Student distribution when $\nu = 1$?

When $\nu = 1$, the Student distribution is known as the Cauchy or Lorentz distribution. It possesses extremely heavy tails, much heavier than those of a Gaussian distribution. This characteristic highlights its robustness to outliers and the fact that it lacks a defined mean.

$$
\mathcal{C}(x \mid \mu, \gamma)=\frac{1}{\gamma \pi}\left[1+\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\gamma}\right)^{2}\right]^{-1}
$$

What does Figure 2.16 illustrate regarding the effect of outliers on Gaussian, Student, and Laplace distributions?

%

Figure 2.16 illustrates the effect of outliers on fitting Gaussian, Student, and Laplace distributions as follows:

- **Plot (a) No Outliers**: The Gaussian and Student t-distribution fits are almost identical, indicating similar performance when there are no outliers.
- **Plot (b) With Outliers**: The Gaussian distribution is significantly affected by outliers, with its curve drawn towards the tails. In contrast, the Student t-distribution and Laplace distribution show greater robustness to outliers, with their shapes remaining relatively stable.

This demonstrates that the Student's t-distribution and Laplace distribution are more robust to outliers compared to the Gaussian distribution, which is more sensitive to extreme values.

Figure 2.16 illustrates the impact of outliers on plotting various distributions:

1. In plot (a) without outliers, the Gaussian and Student distributions appear nearly identical, aligning closely with each other.
2. In plot (b) with outliers, the Gaussian distribution is significantly more perturbed, while the Student and Laplace distributions maintain their robustness, showing less deviation from their original fits.

## Explain the pdf of the half Cauchy distribution and when it is used. Why is it considered suitable for Bayesian modeling of distributions over positive reals with heavy tails?

The probability density function (pdf) of the half Cauchy distribution is given by:

$$
\mathcal{C}_{+}(x \mid \gamma) \triangleq \frac{2}{\pi \gamma}\left[1+\left(\frac{x}{\gamma}\right)^{2}\right]^{-1}
$$

This distribution is useful in Bayesian modeling when a distribution over positive reals with heavy tails is needed but finite density at the origin.

The probability density function (pdf) of the Laplace distribution is:

$$
\operatorname{Laplace}(y \mid \mu, b) \triangleq \frac{1}{2b} \exp\left( -\frac{|y - \mu|}{b} \right)

## Define the beta distribution and express the beta function $B(a, b)$ in terms of the gamma function $\Gamma$.

The beta distribution is defined as follows:

$$
\operatorname{Beta}(x \mid a, b)=\frac{1}{B(a, b)} x^{a-1}(1-x)^{b-1}
$$

The beta function $B(a, b)$ is given by:

$$
B(a, b) \triangleq \frac{\Gamma(a) \Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a+b)}
$$

- #beta-distribution, #gamma-function, #beta-function

## What are the mean, mode, and variance of the beta distribution in terms of parameters $a$ and $b$?

For the beta distribution, the mean, mode, and variance are given by:

$$
\text { mean } = \frac{a}{a+b}, \quad \text { mode } = \frac{a-1}{a+b-2}, \quad \text { var } = \frac{a b}{(a+b)^2(a+b+1)}
$$

- #beta-distribution, #moments, #parameterization

## Discuss the conditions under which the beta distribution becomes uniform or bimodal.

When $a = b = 1$, the beta distribution becomes uniform. If $a$ and $b$ are both less than 1, the distribution is bimodal with "spikes" at $0$ and $1$.

$$
\operatorname{Beta}(x \mid 1, 1) = 1 \quad \text{(Uniform distribution)}
$$

If $a, b < 1$, $\operatorname{Beta}(x \mid a, b)$ is bimodal.

## Explain the concept of the Gamma function $\Gamma(a)$ and write down its integral representation.

The Gamma function $\Gamma(a)$ is defined by the integral:

$$
\Gamma(a) \triangleq \int_{0}^{\infty} x^{a-1} e^{-x} \, dx
$$

It generalizes the factorial function to real and complex numbers.

- #gamma-function, #integration, #special-functions
```

## Describe the gamma distribution and its parameters.

The gamma distribution is a flexible distribution for positive real valued random variables, $x>0$. It is defined in terms of two parameters, called the shape $a>0$ and the rate $b>0$:

$$
\operatorname{Ga}(x \mid \text { shape }=a, \text { rate }=b) \triangleq \frac{b^{a}}{\Gamma(a)} x^{a-1} e^{-x b}
$$

- #gamma-distribution, #probability-distributions

## What is an alternative parameterization of the gamma distribution?

Sometimes the gamma distribution is parameterized in terms of the shape $a$ and the scale $s=1 / b$:

$$
\operatorname{Ga}(x \mid \text { shape }=a, \text { scale }=s) \triangleq \frac{1}{s^{a} \Gamma(a)} x^{a-1} e^{-x / s}
$$

- #gamma-distribution, #probability-distributions

## What are the mean, mode, and variance of the gamma distribution?

For the gamma distribution, we have the following properties:

$$
\text { mean }=\frac{a}{b}, \text { mode }=\frac{a-1}{b}, \text { var }=\frac{a}{b^{2}}
$$

Where $a$ is the shape and $b$ is the rate.

- #gamma-distribution, #probability-distributions

## How is the exponential distribution related to the gamma distribution?

The exponential distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution:

$$
\operatorname{Expon}(x \mid \lambda) \triangleq \operatorname{Ga}(x \mid \text { shape }=1, \text { rate }=\lambda)
$$

This distribution describes the times between events in a Poisson process, which occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate $\lambda$.

- #exponential-distribution, #gamma-distribution, #poisson-process

## How does the mode of a gamma distribution change with the parameter $a$ (shape)?

For a gamma distribution,

- If $a \leq 1$, the mode is at $0$.
- If $a > 1$, the mode is at $\frac{a-1}{b}$.

Generated by:

$$
\operatorname{Ga}(x \mid \text { shape }=a, \text { rate }=b) = \frac{b^{a}}{\Gamma(a)} x^{a-1} e^{-x b}
$$

- #gamma-distribution, #probability-distributions

## What happens to the gamma distribution as the rate $b$ increases?

As the rate $b$ increases, the horizontal scale of the gamma distribution is reduced, thus squeezing everything leftwards and upwards. This effect can be illustrated by plotting different gamma distributions with varying rates $b$.

- #gamma-distribution, #probability-distributions

## What are the characteristics of the Beta distribution based on different parameter values?

%

The characteristics of the Beta distribution based on different parameter values \(a\) and \(b\) are:
- If $a < 1$ and $b > 1$, there is a spike on the left.
- If $a > 1$ and $b < 1$, there is a spike on the right.
- If $a = b = 1$, the distribution is uniform.
- If $a > 1$ and $b > 1$, the distribution is unimodal.

## How do the shape and rate parameters affect the Gamma distribution's PDF?

%

For the Gamma distribution:
- The shape parameter \(a\) influences the mode of the distribution. 
- Increasing \(a\) shifts the mode rightwards and increases the peak height.
- The rate parameter \(b\) inversely affects the spread; higher \(b\) values compress the distribution.
- Solid lines represent \(b=1.0\), dashed lines represent \(b=2.0\).

%

- If $a<1$, the distribution shows a "spike" on the left.
- If $b<1$, the distribution shows a "spike" on the right.
- If $a=b=1$, the distribution is uniform.
- If $a>1$ and $b>1$, the distribution is unimodal.

%

The Gamma distribution PDFs shown indicate that:

- Variations in the shape parameter 'a' alter the skewness and peak of the distribution.
- A higher rate parameter 'b' (increasing from 1.0 to 2.0) shifts the mode leftward along the x-axis.
- Different combinations of 'a' and 'b' can result in a range of distribution shapes, from exponential-like to more bell-curved forms.

## What is the definition of the Chi-squared distribution?

The Chi-squared distribution is defined as:

$$

## How is the Chi-squared distribution related to Gaussian random variables?

If $Z_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $S=\sum_{i=1}^{\nu} Z_{i}^{2}$, then $S \sim \chi_{\nu}^{2}$.

## Define the inverse Gamma distribution.

The inverse Gamma distribution is defined as follows:

$$

$$
\text { mean }=\frac{b}{a-1}, \text { mode }=\frac{b}{a+1}, \text { var }=\frac{b^{2}}{(a-1)^{2}(a-2)}
$$

The mean exists if $a>1$ and the variance exists if $a>2$.

## What is the empirical pdf $\hat{p}_{N}(x)$ and how is it approximated?

For a set of $N$ samples $\mathcal{D}=\left\{x^{(1)}, \ldots, x^{(N)}\right\}$ from a distribution $p(X)$, the empirical pdf is approximated by a set of delta functions (or "spikes") centered on these samples:

$$
\hat{p}_{N}(x)=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \delta_{x^{(n)}}(x)
$$

- #statistics, #empirical-distributions.pdf

---

## Explain how the empirical CDF can be derived from the empirical pdf.

The empirical CDF (cumulative distribution function) can be derived by integrating the empirical pdf $\hat{p}_{N}(x)$. Given $N$ samples, the empirical CDF is a step function that increases by $\frac{1}{N}$ at each sample point $x^{(n)}$.

$$
\hat{F}_{N}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x} \hat{p}_{N}(t) \, dt
$$

## What is the empirical distribution $\hat{P}_{N}(x)$ for a dataset $\mathcal{D}$ with $N$ samples?

The empirical distribution of the dataset $\mathcal{D}$ is defined as:

## If $f(X)=1$ if $X$ is even and $f(X)=0$ otherwise, and $p_{x}(X)$ is uniform on the set $\{1, \ldots, 10\}$, what is $p_{y}(1)$?

Given $f(X)=1$ if $X$ is even and $f(X)=0$ otherwise, and $p_{x}(X)$ is uniform on the set $\{1, \ldots, 10\}$, then:

## How is the cdf of a continuous random variable $Y=p(\boldsymbol{y})$ derived from $X$?

For a continuous random variable $X$ and $Y=f(\boldsymbol{x})$ as a deterministic transformation, the cdf of $Y$ is:

## How can we derive the pdf of a continuous random variable $y$ if the transformation function $f$ is invertible?

If the transformation function $f$ is invertible, the pdf of $y$ can be derived by differentiating the cdf:

$$

## What happens when mapping a uniform pdf through the function $f(x) = 2x + 1$?

When mapping a uniform pdf through the function $f(x) = 2x + 1$, the probability density function $p_y(y)$ is transformed using the change of variables formula.

Given:
$$
x \sim \operatorname{Unif}(0,1) \quad \text{and} \quad y = f(x) = 2x + 1,
$$
we use the change of variables formula:
$$
p_{y}(y) = p_{x}(x) \left| \frac{dx}{dy} \right|.
$$

Here, $\frac{dx}{dy} = \frac{1}{\frac{dy}{dx}} = \frac{1}{2}$, so the resulting pdf is:
$$
p_{y}(y) = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

## How do two nearby points $(x, x+dx)$ get mapped under the function $f$ if $\frac{dy}{dx}>0$ versus $\frac{dy}{dx}<0$?

When two nearby points $(x, x+dx)$ get mapped under the function $f(x)=2x+1$:
- If $\frac{dy}{dx} > 0$, the function is locally increasing.
- If $\frac{dy}{dx} < 0$, the function is locally decreasing.

The scaled probability density is the same in both cases since we consider the absolute value.

Given:
$$
p(x) \, dx = p(y) \, dy,
$$
we deduce:
$$
p_{y}(y) = p_{x}(x) \left| \frac{dx}{dy} \right|.
$$

## Derive the probability distribution transformation from $p_x(x)$ to $p_y(y)$ for a monotonic function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$.

For a monotonic function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, the probability distribution transformation from $p_x(x)$ to $p_y(y)$ is:
Given $x = g(y) = f^{-1}(y)$, the cumulative distribution functions satisfy:
$$
P_{y}(y) = \operatorname{Pr}(f(X) \leq y) = \operatorname{Pr}\left(X \leq f^{-1}(y)\right) = P_{x}(g(y)).
$$

Taking derivatives:
$$
p_{y}(y) = \frac{d}{dy} P_{y}(y) = \frac{d}{dy} P_{x}(g(y)) = \frac{dx}{dy} p_{x}(x).
$$

Finally, using the absolute value for general cases:
$$
p_{y}(y) = p_{x}(g(y)) \left| \frac{d}{dy} g(y) \right|.
$$

- #probability, #calculus, #transformations

## For the multivariate case, what is the change of variables formula for pdfs?

In the multivariate case, suppose $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$ and $\mathbf{f}$ is an invertible function mapping $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$, with inverse $\mathbf{g}$. The pdf transformation is:
$$
p_{\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{y}) = p_{\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{y})) \left| \det \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{g}}{\partial \mathbf{y}} \right) \right|,
$$

where $\frac{\partial \mathbf{g}}{\partial \mathbf{y}}$ denotes the Jacobian matrix of $\mathbf{g}$.

- #multivariate-probability, #jacobian, #change-of-variables

## What happens when the function $f$ is monotonically decreasing in the context of transforming probability distributions?

If the function $f$ is monotonically decreasing, the cumulative distribution relationship changes sign. For a decreasing function $f(x)$:
$$
P_{y}(y) = \operatorname{Pr}(f(X) \leq y) = \operatorname{Pr}(X \geq f^{-1}(y)) = 1 - P_{x}(f^{-1}(y)).
$$

Taking derivatives with respect to $y$:
$$
p_{y}(y) = -\frac{d x}{d y} p_{x}(x).
$$

In this case, we still use the absolute value in the final formula:
$$
p_{y}(y) = p_{x}(g(y)) \left| \frac{d}{dy} g(y) \right|.
$$

## Translate the example where $x \sim \operatorname{Unif}(0,1)$ and $y=f(x)=2x+1$ to the derived general change of variables formula.

Given that $x \sim \operatorname{Unif}(0,1)$ and $y = f(x) = 2x + 1$, deriving the general change of variables formula involves the following steps:
1. Calculate:
$$
\frac{dx}{dy} = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

2. Apply the change of variables formula:
$$
p_{y}(y) = p_{x}(g(y)) \left| \frac{d}{dy} g(y) \right|,
$$

where $g(y) = f^{-1}(y) = \frac{y-1}{2}$.

Hence:
$$
p_y(y) = \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{for} \quad y \in [1,3].
$$

## How does the function $f(x) = 2x + 1$ transform a uniform pdf $p(x)$ into a new pdf $p(y)$?

(a) and (b) show the process of mapping a uniform probability density function using the function $f(x)=2x+1$.

What is the effect of the transformation $f(x) = 2x + 1$ on the initial uniform pdf $p(x)$?

%

The transformation $f(x) = 2x + 1$ maps the original uniform pdf $p(x)$, which has a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, into a new uniform pdf $p(y)$ between 1 and 3. This transformation scales the x-domain by a factor of 2 and shifts it by 1 unit, resulting in the new pdf $p(y)$ with a constant value of 0.5, maintaining the total probability mass.

## Conditions for local increase or decrease in transformed pdf

Describe the local behavior of the function $f(x) = 2x + 1$ based on $\frac{dy}{dx}$.

%

For the function $f(x) = 2x + 1$, the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx} = 2$ is always positive. This indicates that the function is locally increasing everywhere in its domain. If $\frac{dy}{dx}$ were greater than 0, the function would be locally increasing. Conversely, if $\frac{dy}{dx}$ were less than 0, the function would be locally decreasing.

%

(a) The uniform pdf is mapped through the function $f(x) = 2x + 1$, resulting in a linear transformation of the input interval.

(b) When analyzing the mapping of two nearby points, $x$ and $x + dx$, through $f(x)$, if $\frac{dy}{dx} > 0$, the function is locally increasing. Conversely, if $\frac{dy}{dx} < 0$, the function is locally decreasing.

%

The left graph in the image illustrates that for the function $f(x)=2x+1$, the slope $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is positive, indicating the function is locally increasing. This means that both $x$ and $y$ increase together.

## What is an affine transformation and how does it apply to the unit square?

An affine transformation is defined as 

$$
f(\boldsymbol{x})=\mathbf{A} \boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{b}
$$

where $\mathbf{A}$ is a matrix and $\boldsymbol{b}$ is a vector. For a unit square:

- If $\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{I}$, we have an identity transformation where the shape remains unchanged but may be translated by $\boldsymbol{b}$.
- If $\boldsymbol{b}=\mathbf{0}$, the transformation scales, rotates, or skews the shape based on $\mathbf{A}$.

For an affine transformation represented by $f(\boldsymbol{x}) = \mathbf{A} \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{b}$ where $\mathbf{A}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}a & c \\ b & d\end{array}\right)$, the area of the unit square transforms by a factor of:

$$

$$

which in the limit is equal to the density at the center of the patch times the size of the patch:

$$
p_{r, \theta}(r, \theta) \, dr \, d\theta = p_{x_1, x_2}(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta) \, r \, dr \, d\theta

%

The affine transformation is illustrated in two parts. On the left, the transformation only involves a translation where the original unit square is shifted to form a new square without scaling (represented as a blue square). On the right, the transformation includes scaling and possibly rotation, forming a parallelogram. This affine transformation can be expressed as $f(\boldsymbol{x}) = \mathbf{A} \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{b}$, where $f(\boldsymbol{x})$ is the transformed vector, $\mathbf{A}$ is the transformation matrix, and $\boldsymbol{b}$ is the translation vector. The area of the parallelogram is given by the determinant of the transformation matrix $\mathbf{A}$, specifically $ad - bc$.

## How is the area of the transformed shape determined in an affine transformation?

$$

the area of the parallelogram formed by the affine transformation is determined by $| \det(\mathbf{A}) | = | ad - bc |$. This value represents the scaling factor of the area due to the transformation.

## What does the image illustrate in terms of affine transformations when $$\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{I}$$ and $$\boldsymbol{b}\neq\mathbf{0}$$?

%

The image illustrates that when $$\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{I}$$ (the identity matrix) and $$\boldsymbol{b}\neq\mathbf{0}$$ (a non-zero vector), the affine transformation applies a translation to the unit square without any scaling or rotation. The original green square is shifted in space to form the blue square, indicating the transformation only involves a translation of the space, without altering the shape or size of the square.

Sure, here are six cards based on the given chunk of the paper:

---

## Derive the mean of $ \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b} $ given that $\mathbf{y}$ is an affine function and $\mathbf{\mu} = \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}]$.

To find the mean, we use the linearity of expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{y}] = \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{A} \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{b}] = \mathbf{A} \mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{x}] + \mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{b}]
$$

Given that $\boldsymbol{b}$ is a constant vector, $\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{b}] = \boldsymbol{b}$, we find:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{y}] = \mathbf{A} \boldsymbol{\mu} + \boldsymbol{b}
$$

- #linear-algebra, #probability

---

## Derive the mean of $y = \boldsymbol{a}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x} + b$ given $\mathbf{\mu} = \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}]$.

For a scalar-valued function:

$$
f(\boldsymbol{x}) = \boldsymbol{a}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x} + b
$$

The mean is:

$$
\mathbb{E}[y] = \mathbb{E}[ \boldsymbol{a}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x} + b ] = \boldsymbol{a}^{\top} \mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{x}] + \mathbb{E}[b]
$$

Given that $b$ is a constant, $\mathbb{E}[b] = b$, so we get:

$$
\mathbb{E}[y] = \boldsymbol{a}^{\top} \boldsymbol{\mu} + b
$$

---

## Derive the covariance of $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$.

The covariance of a linear transformation is given by:

$$
\operatorname{Cov}[\mathbf{y}] = \operatorname{Cov}[\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}]
$$

Since $\mathbf{b}$ is a constant vector, the covariance reduces to:

$$
\operatorname{Cov}[\mathbf{y}] = \mathbf{A} \operatorname{Cov}[\mathbf{x}] \mathbf{A}^{\top}
$$

Denoting $\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \operatorname{Cov}[\mathbf{x}]$, we have:

$$
\operatorname{Cov}[\mathbf{y}] = \mathbf{A} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{A}^{\top}
$$

- #linear-algebra, #probability, #covariance

---

## Derive the variance $\mathbb{V}[y]$ for $y = \boldsymbol{a}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x} + b$.

To find the variance:

$$
\mathbb{V}[y] = \mathbb{V}[\boldsymbol{a}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x} + b]
$$

Since $b$ is a constant, it does not affect the variance:

$$
\mathbb{V}[y] = \boldsymbol{a}^{\top} \operatorname{Cov}[\boldsymbol{x}] \boldsymbol{a}
$$

Denoting $\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \operatorname{Cov}[\boldsymbol{x}]$, we get:

$$
\mathbb{V}[y] = \boldsymbol{a}^{\top} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \boldsymbol{a}
$$

- #linear-algebra, #probability, #variance

---

## Compute the variance $\mathbb{V}[x_1 + x_2]$ for scalar random variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ given $\boldsymbol{a} = [1, 1]$.

To find the variance:

$$
\boldsymbol{a} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \begin{bmatrix} \Sigma_{11} & \Sigma_{12} \\ \Sigma_{21} & \Sigma_{22} \end{bmatrix}
$$

Thus,

$$
\mathbb{V}[x_1 + x_2] = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \Sigma_{11} & \Sigma_{12} \\ \Sigma_{21} & \Sigma_{22} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$
\mathbb{V}[x_1 + x_2] = \Sigma_{11} + \Sigma_{22} + 2 \Sigma_{12}
$$

Which is:

$$
\mathbb{V}[x_1 + x_2] = \mathbb{V}[x_1] + \mathbb{V}[x_2] + 2 \operatorname{Cov}[x_1, x_2]
$$

## What needs to be considered when characterizing the full distribution of $\mathbf{y}$ beyond the mean and covariance?

Although some distributions, like the Gaussian, are fully characterized by their mean and covariance, in general, to derive the full distribution of $\mathbf{y}$, one must use other techniques as well.

**Key points:**
- Gaussian distributions are fully described by mean and covariance.
- For other distributions, mean and covariance are not sufficient.

### ## Discrete Convolution Explanation

Given the vectors $\boldsymbol{x}=[1,2,3,4]$ and $\boldsymbol{y}=[5,6,7]$, how do we compute the discrete convolution $\boldsymbol{z}$?

%
To compute the discrete convolution $\boldsymbol{z}$ of $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$, we use the definition:

$$
z_{n} = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x_{k} y_{n-k}
$$

Since $\boldsymbol{x}$ has finite length and $\boldsymbol{y}$ also has finite length, the summation will only be over valid indices.

Table 2.4 illustrates the step-by-step computation:

1. For $z_{0}$: $\boldsymbol{y}$ is flipped and aligned with $\boldsymbol{x}$, producing
$$
z_{0} = x_{0} \cdot y_{0} = 1 \cdot 5 = 5
$$

### ## Convolution Theorem for PMF of Sum

If $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are independent discrete random variables, how do we find the pmf of their sum $y = x_{1} + x_{2}$?

%
We use the following equation to find the pmf of the sum of two independent discrete random variables $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$:

$$
p(y=j) = \sum_{k} p(x_{1}=k) p(x_{2}=j-k)
$$

This is essentially the convolution of the two probability mass functions (pmfs) of $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$.

For example, if $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are the outcomes of rolling two dice, each following a discrete uniform distribution from 1 to 6, their sum's pmf $p(y=j)$ will be computed by convolving their individual pmfs.

- #math, #probability, #convolution-theorem

### ## Convolution of PDFs

What is the continuous analog of the convolution theorem for two independent random variables $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ with pdfs $p_{1}(x_{1})$ and $p_{2}(x_{2})$?

%
The continuous analog of the convolution theorem is given by the pdf of the sum $y = x_{1} + x_{2}$, derived using the cdf:

$$
P_{y}(y^{*}) = \operatorname{Pr}(y \leq y^{*}) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p_{1}(x_{1}) \left[\int_{-\infty}^{y^{*} - x_{1}} p_{2}(x_{2}) dx_{2}\right] dx_{1}
$$

Differentiating this cdf, we get the pdf:

$$
p(y) = \left[\frac{d}{d y^{*}} P_{y}(y^{*})\right]_{y^{*}=y} = \int p_{1}(x_{1}) p_{2}(y - x_{1}) dx_{1}
$$

Thus, the convolution in the continuous case results in the pdf of the sum being the integral of the product of the individual pdfs.

### ## Differentiation Under the Integral Sign

Explain the rule of differentiation under the integral sign used in the convolution theorem.

%
The rule of differentiation under the integral sign is used to differentiate an integral with varying limits. Given an integral of the form:

$$
\frac{d}{d x} \int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} f(t) dt
$$

where $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ are functions of $x$, the rule states:

$$
\frac{d}{d x} \int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} f(t) dt = f(b(x)) \frac{d b(x)}{d x} - f(a(x)) \frac{d a(x)}{d x}
$$

This rule allows us to differentiate the convolution integral in the cdf derivation, resulting in the pdf.

### ## "Flip and Drag" Operation

Describe the "flip and drag" operation in the context of discrete convolution.

%
The "flip and drag" operation consists of the following steps:

1. **Flip**: Reverse the order of elements in vector $\boldsymbol{y}$. If $\boldsymbol{y} = [5, 6, 7]$, flipping gives $\boldsymbol{y}^{\text{flipped}} = [7, 6, 5]$.
2. **Drag**: Shift $\boldsymbol{y}^{\text{flipped}}$ across vector $\boldsymbol{x}$, one position at a time.
3. **Elementwise Multiplication**: In each position, multiply corresponding elements of $\boldsymbol{x}$ and shifted $\boldsymbol{y}$.
4. **Sum Results**: Sum the products obtained in the elementwise multiplication to get each element of the result vector $\boldsymbol{z}$.

This method visualizes the computation of each element $z_{n}$ in the resultant convolution vector.

### ## Convolution Example with Uniform Distributions

How would the convolution theorem apply to the sum of two uniformly distributed random variables, such as rolling two dice?

%
For two uniformly distributed random variables such as rolls of two dice, each side $s$ of a die follows a discrete uniform distribution:

$$
p_{1}(s) = p_{2}(s) = \frac{1}{6} \text{ for } s \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
$$

The pmf of their sum $y = x_{1} + x_{2}$ is given by the convolution of their individual pmfs:
$$
p(y=j) = \sum_{k} p(x_{1}=k) p(x_{2}=j-k)
$$

For example, $p(y=7)$ is the probability of getting a sum of 7, which is the sum of probabilities of $(1,6)$, $(2,5)$, $(3,4)$, $(4,3)$, $(5,2)$, $(6,1)$ outcomes, each with probability $\frac{1}{36}$. Thus:

$$
p(7) = p(1,6) + p(2,5) + p(3,4) + p(4,3) + p(5,2) + p(6,1) = 6 \cdot \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{6}
$$

## What will be the probability distribution of the sum of two dice rolls, $y=x_{1}+x_{2}$, where $x_{i} \sim \operatorname{Unif}(\{1,2, \ldots, 6\})$?

When summing two uniformly distributed dice rolls, the distribution of the sum 'y' is computed as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& p(y=2)=p\left(x_{1}=1\right) p\left(x_{2}=1\right)=\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{36} \\
& p(y=3)=p\left(x_{1}=1\right) p\left(x_{2}=2\right)+p\left(x_{1}=2\right) p\left(x_{2}=1\right)=\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6}=\frac{2}{36}
\end{aligned}
$$

Continuing in this way, we find $p(y=4)=3/36, p(y=5)=4/36, p(y=6)=5/36, p(y=7)=6/36$, $p(y=8)=5/36, p(y=9)=4/36, p(y=10)=3/36, p(y=11)=2/36$ and $p(y=12)=1/36$.

## Given that $x_{1} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}, \sigma_{1}^{2}\right)$ and $x_{2} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}, \sigma_{2}^{2}\right)$, what is $p(y)$ where $y = x_{1} + x_{2}$?

When two independent Gaussian random variables are summed, their resultant distribution is also Gaussian:

$$
p(y)=\mathcal{N}\left(y \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}+\boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}, \sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2}\right)
$$

This result shows the convolution of two Gaussian distributions.

## What is an example of a probability density function (pdf) of the sum of two continuous random variables?

An example of the pdf of the sum of two continuous random variables, each following a Gaussian distribution, can be represented as:

## Considering $N_{\mathcal{D}}$ iid random variables with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$, what can we say about the distribution of their sum $S_{N_{\mathcal{D}}}=\sum_{n=1}^{N_{\mathcal{D}}} X_{n}$ as $N_{\mathcal{D}}$ increases?

As $N_{\mathcal{D}}$ increases, the distribution of the sum approaches:

$$
p\left(S_{N_{\mathcal{D}}}=u\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi N_{\mathcal{D}} \sigma^{2}}} \exp \left(-\frac{\left(u-N_{\mathcal{D}} \mu\right)^{2}}{2 N_{\mathcal{D}} \sigma^{2}}\right)
$$

This result is a consequence of the Central Limit Theorem.

## How do you calculate $p(y=3)$ where $y=x_{1}+x_{2}$ and $x_{i} \sim \operatorname{Unif}(\{1,2, \ldots, 6\})$?

To calculate $p(y=3)$:
$$
p(y=3)=p\left(x_{1}=1\right) p\left(x_{2}=2\right)+p\left(x_{1}=2\right) p\left(x_{2}=1\right)=\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6}=\frac{2}{36}

## What does the Central Limit Theorem state regarding the distribution of the sum of a large number of iid random variables?

The Central Limit Theorem states that the sum of a large number of iid random variables with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ will be approximately normally distributed regardless of the original distribution of the variables. 

$$
p\left(S_{N_{\mathcal{D}}}=u\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi N_{\mathcal{D}} \sigma^{2}}} \exp \left(-\frac{\left(u-N_{\mathcal{D}} \mu\right)^{2}}{2 N_{\mathcal{D}} \sigma^{2}}\right)

%

The bar chart in Figure 2.22 represents the probability distribution of the sum of two dice rolls, denoted as $y = x_1 + x_2$ where $x_i \sim \operatorname{Unif}(\{1, 2, \ldots, 6\})$. The x-axis shows possible sums (2 to 12), and the y-axis shows the probabilities of these sums both as decimal fractions and as ratios out of 36 (total possible outcomes). The highest probability occurs for the sum of 7, with a symmetrical decrease on either side, indicating the sums' decreasing likelihood toward the extremes.

Explain why the sum of 7 has the highest probability in the distribution of two dice rolls.

%

In the distribution of the sum of two dice rolls, the sum of 7 has the highest probability because there are six different combinations of two dice that result in this sum: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1). Each combination is equally likely, making the probability of rolling a sum of 7 equal to $\frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$.

## What is the probability distribution of the sum of two dice rolls?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_13_3b03ebbae3c95d0ddb56g-1.jpg?height=393&width=518&top_left_y=196&top_left_x=751)
    
%  
    
The probability distribution of the sum of two dice rolls, $p(y)$ where $y = x_1 + x_2$ and $x_i \sim \operatorname{Unif}(\{1,2,\ldots,6\})$, is as follows:

- 2: $1/36$

- 4: $3/36$
- 5: $4/36$
- 6: $5/36$
- 7: $6/36$
- 8: $5/36$
- 9: $4/36$
- 10: $3/36$

## Which sum of two dice rolls has the highest probability and why?

%
    
The sum of two dice rolls that has the highest probability is 7. This is because there are six different dice combinations that produce the sum of 7 (i.e., $(1,6)$, $(2,5)$, $(3,4)$, $(4,3)$, $(5,2)$, and $(6,1)$), resulting in a probability of $6/36$ or $1/6$.

## What is the definition of a probability mass function (pmf)?
 
A probability mass function (pmf) is defined as the function that computes the probability of events corresponding to each possible value of a discrete random variable: 

$$ p(x) \triangleq \operatorname{Pr}(X=x) $$

The pmf satisfies the following properties: 

$$ 0 \leq p(x) \leq 1 $$
and 
$$ \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x)=1 $$

- #probability-theory, #pmf.definition

## What are the properties that a probability mass function (pmf) must satisfy?

A probability mass function (pmf), $p(x)$, must satisfy the properties:

$$ 0 \leq p(x) \leq 1 $$
and
$$ \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x)=1 $$

- #probability-theory, #pmf.properties

## Can two pmf's be defined on the same state space? Use Figure 2.1 as context to explain.

Yes, two different pmf's can be defined on the same state space $\mathcal{X}$. For example, Figure 2.1 shows two pmf's defined on $\mathcal{X}=\{1,2,3,4\}$: 

1. A uniform distribution where $p(x)=\frac{1}{4}$.
2. A degenerate distribution where $p(x)=\mathbb{I}(x=1)$, meaning all probability mass is on $x=1$.

$$ \mathbb{I}(x=1) = \begin {cases} 
1 & \text{if } x = 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
$$

## What is the formula to compute the probability of being in an interval $(X \in \mathcal{C})$ in terms of cumulative distribution functions (cdf)?

The formula to compute the probability of being in an interval $C=(a < X \leq b)$ is:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(C) = \operatorname{Pr}(B) - \operatorname{Pr}(A)
$$

where:
- $A = (X \leq a)$
- $B = (X \leq b)$

Both $A$ and $C$ are mutually exclusive, and $B=A \vee C$.

- #probability-theory, #cdf.interval-probability

## Define a continuous random variable and explain how it can be related to discrete random variables using intervals.

A continuous random variable $X \in \mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued quantity that does not have a finite or countable set of distinct possible values. However, we can partition the real line into countable intervals and consider the probability of $X$ residing in these intervals. By shrinking the size of these intervals to zero, we can approximate the behavior similar to discrete random variables.

- #probability-theory, #continuous-rv.definition

## How does the sum rule apply to mutually exclusive events in relation to cumulative distribution functions (cdf)?

The sum rule states that if two events, $A$ and $C$, are mutually exclusive (i.e., they cannot occur simultaneously), then the probability of their union is the sum of their individual probabilities. In terms of cumulative distribution functions, for events $A=(X \leq a)$ and $C=(a < X \leq b)$ where $a < b$ and $B=A \vee C$:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(B) = \operatorname{Pr}(A) + \operatorname{Pr}(C)
$$

Consequently, 

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(C) = \operatorname{Pr}(B) - \operatorname{Pr}(A)
$$

**## Explain the Central Limit Theorem and how it is depicted in the given figures.**

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of the sample mean $\bar{X}$ approaches a normal distribution as the sample size $N_\mathcal{D}$ increases, regardless of the original distribution of the population. This is depicted in Figure 2.23, where we plot:
$$
\hat{\mu}_{N}^{s}=\frac{1}{N_{\mathcal{D}}} \sum_{n=1}^{N_{\mathcal{D}}} x_{n s}

**## Derive the standardized form of the sample mean given in the Central Limit Theorem.**

Starting from the sample mean $\bar{X} = \frac{S_{N}}{N}$, the standardized form is given by:
$$
Z_{N_{\mathcal{D}}} \triangleq \frac{S_{N_{\mathcal{D}}}-N_{\mathcal{D}} \mu}{\sigma \sqrt{N_{\mathcal{D}}}} = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{N_{\mathcal{D}}}}
$$
where $S_{N_{\mathcal{D}}}$ is the sum of samples, $\mu$ is the population mean, and $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation. This shows the distribution converges to the standard normal distribution.

**## Explain the concept of Monte Carlo approximation.**

Monte Carlo approximation involves drawing large numbers of samples from a distribution to approximate another distribution. Suppose $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a random variable, and $\boldsymbol{y} = f(\boldsymbol{x})$. We draw samples from $p(\boldsymbol{x})$ and use these to approximate $p(\boldsymbol{y})$. For example, for $x \sim \operatorname{Unif}(-1, 1)$ and $y = f(x) = x^2$, the empirical distribution is given by:
$$
p_{S}(y) \triangleq \frac{1}{N_{s}} \sum_{s=1}^{N_{s}} \delta\left(y-y_{s}\right)
$$

**## What is the generalized form of the sample mean $\bar{X}$ in the Central Limit Theorem?**

The sample mean $\bar{X}$ is given by:
$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i
$$
where $X_i$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. As $N \to \infty$, $\bar{X} \to \mu$, the population mean.

**## Derive the standard error of the mean.**

For the sample mean $\bar{X}$, the standard error is given by:
$$
\text{SE}(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}
$$
where $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, and $N$ is the sample size. This shows how variability in the sample mean decreases with an increasing sample size.

---

**## How is Monte Carlo approximation applied to approximate the distribution $p(y)$ for $y=f(x)=x^2$ where $x \sim \operatorname{Unif}(-1,1)$?**

Monte Carlo approximation for this problem involves drawing samples $x_s$ from the uniform distribution $x \sim \operatorname{Unif}(-1,1)$, squaring them to get $y_s = f(x_s) = x_s^2$, and computing the empirical distribution:
$$
p_{S}(y) \triangleq \frac{1}{N_{s}} \sum_{s=1}^{N_{s}} \delta\left(y-y_{s}\right)
$$
where $N_s$ is the number of samples. This empirical distribution approximates $p(y)$.

It is computed for \(s=1: 10000\) iterations. For \(N=1\), it shows the distribution for individual samples. As \(N_{\mathcal{D}}\) increases, the distribution of sample means trends towards a Gaussian distribution, thereby demonstrating the central limit theorem.

## Explain what happens to the distribution of sample means as \( N_{\mathcal{D}} \) increases, based on the provided histogram.

As \( N_{\mathcal{D}} \) increases, the distribution of sample means \(\hat{\mu}_{N}^{s}\) approaches a Gaussian distribution. This is consistent with the central limit theorem, which states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of sufficiently large numbers of i.i.d. random variables, regardless of the original distribution, will tend towards a normal distribution as \( N_{\mathcal{D}} \rightarrow \infty\).

## Explain the concept of conditional independence in the context of Exercise 2.1.

The concept of conditional independence is best illustrated using Bayes' rule. For random variables $E_1$ and $E_2$ to be conditionally independent given $H$, denote:

$$
P(E_1 \perp E_2 \mid H)
$$

Mathematically, $E_1$ and $E_2$ being conditionally independent given $H$ can be expressed as:

$$
P(E_1, E_2 \mid H) = P(E_1 \mid H) P(E_2 \mid H)
$$

Let's consider the three given sets of numbers to determine their sufficiency for calculating $\vec{P}(H \mid e_1, e_2)$:

- Set 1: $P(e_1, e_2)$, $P(H)$, $P(e_1 \mid H)$, $P(e_2 \mid H)$
- Set 2: $P(e_1, e_2)$, $P(H)$, $P(e_1, e_2 \mid H)$
- Set 3: $P(e_1 \mid H)$, $P(e_2 \mid H)$, $P(H)$

By applying Bayes' rule and the conditional independence assumption, verify which set(s) are sufficient for computing $\vec{P}(H \mid e_1, e_2)$.

- #probability-theory, #statistical-inference

## Given the three sets of numbers in Exercise 2.1, which are sufficient to compute $\vec{P}(H \mid e_1, e_2)$ without the conditional independence assumption?

The goal is to compute the vector:

$$
\vec{P}(H \mid e_1, e_2) = \left(P(H=1 \mid e_1, e_2), \ldots, P(H=K \mid e_1, e_2)\right)
$$

Using Bayes' rule:

$$
P(H \mid e_1, e_2) = \frac{P(e_1, e_2 \mid H) P(H)}{P(e_1, e_2)}
$$

Set 2 is sufficient because it directly provides $P(e_1, e_2 \mid H)$, $P(H)$, and $P(e_1, e_2)$:

$$
\text {ii.} \ P(e_1, e_2), \ P(H), \ P(e_1, e_2 \mid H) 
$$
are sufficient for the calculation.

- #probability-theory, #conditional-independence, #bayesian-inference

## Given the assumption $E_1 \perp E_2 \mid H$, which sets from Exercise 2.1 are sufficient to compute $\vec{P}(H \mid e_1, e_2)$?

Under the assumption $E_1 \perp E_2 \mid H$, we have:

$$
P(E_1, E_2 \mid H) = P(E_1 \mid H) P(E_2 \mid H)
$$

Thus, the calculation of $\vec{P}(H \mid e_1, e_2)$ simplifies to:

$$
P(H \mid e_1, e_2) = \frac{P(e_1 \mid H) P(e_2 \mid H) P(H)}{P(e_1, e_2)}
$$

Sets 1 and 3 are sufficient due to the provided conditional independence condition. Specifically, Set 1 provides all needed conditional probabilities directly:

$$
\text {i. } P(e_1, e_2), P(H), P(e_1 \mid H), P(e_2 \mid H)
$$

and Set 3 also suffices:

$$
\text {iii. } P(e_1 \mid H), P(e_2 \mid H), P(H)
$$

## Demonstrate that pairwise independence does not imply mutual independence by considering random variables $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$.

Consider three random variables $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$. If $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent and $X_1$ and $X_3$ are independent, it does not necessarily mean that $X_1, X_2, X_3$ are mutually independent.

To be mutually independent, the joint probability, $P(X_1, X_2, X_3)$, must factorize as:

$$
P(X_1, X_2, X_3) = P(X_1) P(X_2) P(X_3)
$$

However, pairwise independence only ensures:

$$
P(X_1, X_2) = P(X_1) P(X_2)
$$

$$
P(X_1, X_3) = P(X_1) P(X_3)
$$

Imagine a scenario with unequal marginal probabilities for non-mutual independence to persist even with pairwise independence.

## Explain the technique of computing a distribution via the change of variables demonstrated in the figure from the paper.

In the context of Figure 2.24, suppose $y = x^2$, where $p(x)$ follows a uniform distribution. To find the distribution $p(y)$, use the change of variables technique:

If $X \sim \text{Uniform}(a, b)$, then $p(X) = \frac{1}{b-a}$.

1. Define the new variable $Y = g(X) = X^2$.
2. Compute the Jacobian determinant: $\left| \frac{dX}{dY} \right|$.
3. Use the formula for transformation of variables in probability distributions:

$$
p_Y(y) = p_X(x) \left| \frac{dx}{dy} \right|
$$

Apply these steps to generate $p_Y(y)$ from a uniform $p_X(x)$. Here, $X$ is mapped to $Y$ through a quadratic transformation affecting the distribution.

- #probability-theory, #change-of-variables

## Describe the Monte Carlo approximation method as applied in the figure from the paper.

Monte Carlo approximation involves using random sampling to estimate the distribution of a function of random variables. For $y = x^2$:

1. Draw several random samples from the distribution $p(x)$.
2. Compute $y_i = x_i^2$ for each sample $x_i$.
3. Construct an empirical histogram of $y_i$ to approximate $p(y)$.

In Figure 2.24, the left plot shows the uniform distribution $p(x)$, the middle plot shows the analytical result of $p(y)$, and the right plot shows the Monte Carlo approximation of $p(y)$. This method is often useful when analytical solutions are difficult.

- #monte-carlo, #probability-theory, #approximation

## Using Exercise 2.2, define pairwise independence and give an example where it does not imply mutual independence.

Pairwise independence for two random variables $X_1$ and $X_2$ means:

$$
p(X_2 \mid X_1) = p(X_2)
$$

and hence:

$$
p(X_2, X_1) = p(X_1) p(X_2)
$$

However, if we have three variables $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$ that are pairwise independent:

$$
p(X_2, X_1) = p(X_1) p(X_2)
$$

$$
p(X_3, X_1) = p(X_1) p(X_3)
$$

$$
p(X_3, X_2) = p(X_2) p(X_3)
$$

They are not necessarily mutually independent, which requires:

$$
p(X_1, X_2, X_3) = p(X_1) p(X_2) p(X_3)
$$

Example: Consider $X_1, X_2, X_3$ where each can independently take values $+1$ or $-1$, but we ensure that the product always equals $+1$. Then $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent, but $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$ are not mutually independent.

## Back of Card 2

In Figure 2.24, the Monte Carlo approximation (right plot) is compared to the analytic result (middle plot) of the distribution \( p(y) \) where \( y = x^2 \) and \( p(x) \) is uniform. Monte Carlo methods, which approximate distributions through random sampling, generally align well with analytic solutions but can provide empirical distributions where analytic solutions are challenging to derive. This method is especially beneficial for complex, multidimensional integrations commonly encountered in statistical physics, statistics, and machine learning.

How does the central limit theorem apply to the context of the sample means shown in figure (a) and (b)?

%

Figures (a) and (b) demonstrate the central limit theorem by showing that as the number of samples \( N \) increases, the distribution of the sample mean \( \hat{\mu}_N^s \) approaches a Gaussian distribution. Specifically, figure (a) corresponds to \( N=1 \) and results in a distribution shaped by the underlying Beta distribution \( \text{Beta}(1,5) \), while figure (b) shows that for \( N=5 \), the distribution begins to approximate a Gaussian shape.

## Derive the probability of a random variable $X$ being within the interval $(a, b]$ using the cdf.

Given the cumulative distribution function (cdf) $P(x) = \operatorname{Pr}(X \leq x)$, we can compute the probability of $X$ being in the interval $(a, b]$ as:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(a < X \leq b) = P(b) - P(a)
$$

- #probability-theory, #statistics.cdf


## What is the probability density function (pdf) and how is it related to the cdf?

The probability density function (pdf) $p(x)$ is defined as the derivative of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) $P(x)$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$
p(x) \triangleq \frac{d}{d x} P(x)
$$

(Note that this derivative does not always exist, in which case the pdf is not defined.)

- #probability-theory, #statistics.pdf

## How can we compute the probability of a random variable $X$ being within the interval $(a, b]$ using the pdf?

Given the pdf $p(x)$, the probability of a continuous variable $X$ being in the interval $(a, b]$ is computed as:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(a < X \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b} p(x) d x = P(b) - P(a)
$$

- #probability-theory, #statistics.pdf

## Explain the approximation for the probability of $X$ being in a small interval around $x$.

For a small interval around $x$, the probability of $X$ being within $(x, x + dx]$ is approximately:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(x < X \leq x + dx) \approx p(x) dx
$$

This implies that the probability of $X$ being in a small interval around $x$ is the density at $x$ times the width of the interval.

- #probability-theory, #statistics.approximation

## Define the non-shaded probability region in Figure 2.2b and the corresponding cutoff points using the cdf $\Phi$.

In Figure 2.2b, the non-shaded region contains $1 - \alpha$ of the probability mass. The cutoff points for this region are defined as $\Phi^{-1}(\alpha / 2)$ and $\Phi^{-1}(1 - \alpha / 2)$. By symmetry, we have:

$$
\Phi^{-1}(1 - \alpha / 2) = -\Phi^{-1}(\alpha / 2)
$$

where $\Φ$ is the cdf of the Gaussian distribution.

- #probability-theory, #statistics.cdf

## Provide an example of how a cdf can be used to find the probability of a random variable within a specified interval.

Consider a standard normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ with cdf $\Phi(x)$. To find the probability of $X$ being within the interval $(-1, 1]$, we use:

$$
P(-1 < X \leq 1) = \Phi(1) - \Phi(-1)
$$

Knowing that $\Phi(-x) = 1 - \Phi(x)$ for the standard normal distribution, it follows:

$$
P(-1 < X \leq 1) = \Phi(1) - (1 - \Phi(1)) = 2\Phi(1) - 1
$$

Figure 2.2 presents two plots related to the standard normal distribution, denoted as $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$:

- (b) The plot on the right is the probability density function (pdf), characterized by its bell shape, peaking at the mean ($0$). The shaded regions within the tails indicate $\alpha / 2$ of the probability mass, which corresponds to the tails of the distribution.

The x-axis represents the variable \(x\) ranging from approximately -3 to 3, and the y-axis represents the cumulative probability from 0 to 1. The curve smoothly increases from left to right, illustrating the probability that a random variable \(X\) drawn from the distribution will have a value less than or equal to \(x\).

%

The shaded areas under the curve at both tails of the right plot, labeled as (b), represent \(\alpha / 2\), corresponding to the tails of the distribution. These areas are symmetric around the mean (which is 0 for the standard normal distribution). The unshaded region under the curve represents the probability mass of \(1 - \alpha\), typically used to denote the central region within which the majority of the distribution's values fall. This concept is often utilized in confidence interval calculations.

## What is the central interval that contains 95% of the mass for a standard Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$?

For a standard Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, the central interval containing 95% of the mass is:

$$
\left(\Phi^{-1}(0.025), \Phi^{-1}(0.975)\right) = (-1.96, 1.96)

## How do you express the 95% interval for a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$?

For a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$, the 95% interval is given by:

$$
(\mu - 1.96 \sigma, \mu + 1.96 \sigma)
$$

This is often approximated as $\mu \pm 2\sigma$.

- #statistics, #gaussian.confidence-interval


## How is the marginal distribution of a random variable $X$ derived from the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$?

The marginal distribution of $X$ is derived from the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$ by summing over all possible states of $Y$:

$$
p(X=x) = \sum_{y} p(X=x, Y=y)
$$

This is sometimes called the sum rule or the rule of total probability.

## What is the chain rule of probability for $D$ variables?

To find the joint distribution of $D$ variables using the chain rule of probability, we extend the product rule:

$$
p\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{1: D}\right)=p\left(x_{1}\right) p\left(x_{2} \mid x_{1}\right) p\left(x_{3} \mid x_{1}, x_{2}\right) p\left(x_{4} \mid x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\right) \ldots p\left(x_{D} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_{1: D-1}\right)
$$

The chain rule of probability allows us to construct high dimensional joint distributions from a set of conditional distributions. Each term in the product represents a conditional probability of a variable given the preceding ones.

## How many parameters are needed to define the joint distribution of two discrete random variables, $X$ and $Y$, under the assumption of independence?

For two discrete random variables, $X$ with 6 states and $Y$ with 5 states, assuming independence simplifies the parameter estimation:

$$p(x, y) = p(x) p(y)$$

A general joint distribution would need $(6 \times 5) - 1 = 29$ parameters due to the sum-to-one constraint. With independence, we only need $(6-1) + (5-1) = 9$ parameters.

This significant reduction in parameters is due to the assumption that $X$ and $Y$ do not influence each other.

```markdown
## What does it mean for two variables $X$ and $Y$ to be unconditionally or marginally independent?

Two variables $X$ and $Y$ are unconditionally or marginally independent (denoted $X \perp Y$) if the joint probability can be written as a product of their marginals:

$$X \perp Y \Longleftrightarrow p(X, Y) = p(X) p(Y)$$

This means the occurrence of $X$ does not affect the occurrence of $Y$ and vice versa.

- #probability, #independence
```
```markdown
## What defines mutual independence among a set of variables $X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n}$?

A set of variables $X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n}$ is considered mutually independent if the joint probability can be decomposed into the product of the individual marginals for all subsets $\left\{X_{1}, \ldots, X_{m}\right\} \subseteq \left\{X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n}\right\}$:

$$
p\left(X_{1}, \ldots, X_{m}\right) = \prod_{i=1}^{m} p\left(X_{i}\right)
$$

For example, if $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$ are mutually independent, then:

$$
p\left(X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}\right) = p\left(X_{1}\right) p\left(X_{2}\right) p\left(X_{3}\right),
$$
$$
p\left(X_{1}, X_{2}\right) = p\left(X_{1}\right) p\left(X_{2}\right),
$$
$$
p\left(X_{2}, X_{3}\right) = p\left(X_{2}\right) p\left(X_{3}\right),
$$
$$
p\left(X_{1}, X_{3}\right) = p\left(X_{1}\right) p\left(X_{3}\right)
$$

Each condition ensures that every subset of the variables is independent of the others.

## How is conditional independence defined between variables $X$ and $Y$ given $Z$?

Conditional independence between $X$ and $Y$ given $Z$ (denoted $X \perp Y \mid Z$) means that the conditional joint probability can be factored into the product of the conditional marginals:

$$X \perp Y \mid Z \Longleftrightarrow p(X, Y \mid Z) = p(X \mid Z) p(Y \mid Z)$$

This states that $X$ and $Y$ are independent given that $Z$ is known.

- #probability, #conditional-independence
```
```markdown
## Explain with an example how unconditional independence is rare and how conditional independence is more practical.

Unconditional independence is rare in practice because most variables can influence each other. However, this influence is often indirect and mediated via other variables. 

For instance, suppose $X$ and $Y$ represent two health conditions that are both influenced by a third variable $Z$ (such as age). Although $X$ and $Y$ are not unconditionally independent, knowing $Z$ might render them conditionally independent:

$$X \perp Y \mid Z \Rightarrow p(X, Y \mid Z) = p(X \mid Z) p(Y \mid Z)$$

This conditional independence is more useful and practical in analyzing real-world scenarios where direct influence is mediated by other factors.

### What is being visualized in Figure 2.3, and how does this aid in understanding the relationship between two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$?

Figure 2.3 visualizes the concept of unconditional (or marginal) independence between two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$. It shows:

- The joint probability distribution $P(X, Y)$ of $X$ and $Y$ as a grid where $X$ has 6 possible states and $Y$ has 5 possible states.
- The marginal probability distributions $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$ as smaller grids obtained by summing over rows and columns of $P(X, Y)$ respectively.

The figure illustrates that the joint distribution can be factorized as $p(x, y) = p(x)p(y)$, confirming the independence of $X$ and $Y$. This reduces the number of parameters needed to define the joint distribution from 29 to 9.

For $n$ independent random variables $\{X_i\}$, the expectation of their product is given by:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}\right] = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{E}[X_{i}]
$$

Where $\mathbb{E}$ denotes expectation, and the independence of the random variables $X_i$ is crucial.

## Define the variance of a distribution and provide its mathematical expression.

The variance, denoted by $\sigma^2$, is a measure of the "spread" of a distribution. It is defined as follows:

$$
\mathbb{V}[X] \triangleq \mathbb{E}\left[(X - \mu)^2\right] = \int (x - \mu)^2 p(x) \, dx
$$

This can also be expressed as:

$$
\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mu^2
$$

Where $\mu$ is the mean (expected value) of $X$.

## What is the expected value of $X^2$ in terms of the mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$?

The expected value of $X^2$ is given by:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[X^{2}\right]=\sigma^{2}+\mu^{2}
$$

Where:
- $\mathbb{E}\left[X^{2}\right]$ is the expected value of $X^2$
- $\sigma^2$ is the variance of $X$
- $\mu$ is the mean of $X$

The relation $\mathbb{E}\left[X^{2}\right]=\sigma^{2}+\mu^{2}$ captures how the second moment of a random variable can be decomposed into its variance and the square of its mean.

## Define the standard deviation of a random variable $X$.

The standard deviation of a random variable $X$ is defined as:

$$
\operatorname{std}[X] \triangleq \sqrt{\mathbb{V}[X]}=\sigma
$$

Where:
- $\operatorname{std}[X]$ is the standard deviation of $X$
- $\mathbb{V}[X]$ is the variance of $X$
- $\sigma$ is another symbol representing the standard deviation, having the same units as $X$ itself.

## What is the variance of a linear transformation $aX + b$ of a random variable $X$?

The variance of $aX + b$ is given by:

$$
\mathbb{V}[aX + b] = a^{2} \mathbb{V}[X]
$$

Where:
- $\mathbb{V}[X]$ is the variance of the original random variable $X$
- $a$ and $b$ are constants.

The constant $b$ does not affect the variance, while the constant $a$ scales the variance by $a^2$.

## What is the variance of the sum of $n$ independent random variables $X_i$?

The variance of the sum of $n$ independent random variables is:

$$
\mathbb{V}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}\right] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{V}[X_i]
$$

Where:
- $X_i$ are the independent random variables
- $\mathbb{V}[X_i]$ are their variances
- $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n$

This property arises because the covariance terms are zero for independent random variables.

## Derive the variance of the product of $n$ random variables $X_i$.

The variance of the product of $n$ random variables $X_i$ is derived as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{V}\left[\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}\right] & =\mathbb{E}\left[\left(\prod_{i} X_{i}\right)^{2}\right]-\left(\mathbb{E}\left[\prod_{i} X_{i}\right]\right)^{2} \\
& =\mathbb{E}\left[\prod_{i} X_{i}^{2}\right] - \left(\prod_{i} \mathbb{E}[X_i]\right)^{2} \\
& =\prod_{i} \mathbb{E}[X_i^2] - \prod_{i} \left(\mathbb{E}[X_i]\right)^2 \\
& =\prod_{i} (\mathbb{V}[X_i] + (\mathbb{E}[X_i])^2) - \prod_{i} (\mathbb{E}[X_i])^2 \\
& =\prod_{i} (\sigma_i^2 + \mu_i^2) - \prod_{i} \mu_i^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Where:
- $\sigma_i^2$ is the variance of $X_i$
- $\mu_i$ is the mean of $X_i$

## What is the mode of a distribution?

The mode of a distribution is the value with the highest probability mass or probability density:

$$
\boldsymbol{x}^{*} = \underset{\boldsymbol{x}}{\operatorname{argmax}} p(\boldsymbol{x})
$$

Where:
- $p(\boldsymbol{x})$ is the probability mass function (PMF) for discrete distributions or the probability density function (PDF) for continuous distributions
- $\boldsymbol{x}^{*}$ is the mode

If the distribution is multimodal, the mode may not be unique.

## State and explain the law of iterated expectations.

The law of iterated expectations, also known as the law of total expectation, states that:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = \mathbb{E}_{Y}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]]
$$

Where:
- $\mathbb{E}[X]$ is the expected value of $X$
- $\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]$ is the conditional expectation of $X$ given $Y$

This law expresses that the expected value of $X$ is the expected value of the conditional expectation of $X$ given $Y$, averaged over the distribution of $Y$.
