Explain the concept of heteroscedasticity in linear regression as illustrated in the given image.

%

In heteroscedasticity, the variance of the errors is not constant across all levels of the independent variables. This is depicted in the image where the variance $\sigma(x)^2$ is a function of $x$, indicating that the spread of the data points around the regression line changes with $x$. This contrasts with homoskedasticity, where the variance $\sigma^2$ is fixed and does not depend on $x$.

What is the general form of a conditional density model used in dealing with heteroscedasticity in linear regression?

%

The general form of a conditional density model used in dealing with heteroscedasticity in linear regression is:

$$
p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})=\mathcal{N}\left(y \mid f_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}), f_{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})^{2}\right)
$$

Here, $f_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})$ predicts the mean and $f_{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})^2$ predicts the variance, which depends on input $\boldsymbol{x}$.
