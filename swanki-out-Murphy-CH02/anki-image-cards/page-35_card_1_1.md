## How does the function $f(x) = 2x + 1$ transform a uniform pdf $p(x)$ into a new pdf $p(y)$?

The function $f(x) = 2x + 1$ maps a uniform pdf $p(x)$ from [0, 1] with a constant value of 1 into a new pdf $p(y)$ on the interval [1, 3]. This transformation shifts and stretches the original distribution, resulting in a new uniform pdf $p(y)$ with a value of 0.5 to preserve the total probability mass.
