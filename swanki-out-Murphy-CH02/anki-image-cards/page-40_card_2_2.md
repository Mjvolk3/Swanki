The histogram represents the distribution of sample means, specifically \(\hat{\mu}_{N}^{s}=\frac{1}{N_{\mathcal{D}}} \sum_{n=1}^{N_{\mathcal{D}}} x_{n s}\), where \(x_{n s} \sim \operatorname{Beta}(1,5)\). It is computed for \(s=1: 10000\) iterations. For \(N=1\), it shows the distribution for individual samples. As \(N_{\mathcal{D}}\) increases, the distribution of sample means trends towards a Gaussian distribution, thereby demonstrating the central limit theorem.

## Explain what happens to the distribution of sample means as \( N_{\mathcal{D}} \) increases, based on the provided histogram.

As \( N_{\mathcal{D}} \) increases, the distribution of sample means \(\hat{\mu}_{N}^{s}\) approaches a Gaussian distribution. This is consistent with the central limit theorem, which states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of sufficiently large numbers of i.i.d. random variables, regardless of the original distribution, will tend towards a normal distribution as \( N_{\mathcal{D}} \rightarrow \infty\).
