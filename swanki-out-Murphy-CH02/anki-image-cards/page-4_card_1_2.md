**Distribution in (a):**
- Uniform distribution over $\mathcal{X}=\{1,2,3,4\}$
- Probability for each $x \in \mathcal{X}$ is $p(x=k)=\frac{1}{4}$

**Distribution in (b):**
- Degenerate distribution (delta function)
- All probability mass on $x=1$; $p(x=1) = 1$, $p(x=2)=p(x=3)=p(x=4)=0$

**Graph (a) - Uniform Distribution:**
- All four bars are of equal height
- Each outcome in $\mathcal{X}=\{1,2,3,4\}$ has an equal probability of $p(x=k) = \frac{1}{4}$.

**Graph (b) - Degenerate Distribution:**
- The first bar is at height 1, indicating $p(x=1) = 1$
- The remaining three bars are at height 0, indicating $p(x=2)=p(x=3)=p(x=4)=0$.
