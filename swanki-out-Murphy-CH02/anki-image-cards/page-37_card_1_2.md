The image depicts a differential area element in polar coordinates. The area of the shaded patch is given by $r dr d\theta$, highlighting the change from polar coordinates (radius $r$ and angle $\theta$) to Cartesian coordinates. The shaded patch represents an infinitesimal sector-shaped area bounded by $r \to r + dr$ and $\theta \to \theta + d\theta$.

## What is the differential area element in polar coordinates for a small patch defined by $r$ and $\theta$?

The differential area element in polar coordinates for a small patch defined by $r$ (radius) and $\theta$ (angle) is $r dr d\theta$. This accounts for the radial change $dr$ and the angular change $d\theta$, with $r$ being the radius.
