The left graph in the image illustrates that for the function $f(x)=2x+1$, the slope $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is positive, indicating the function is locally increasing. This means that both $x$ and $y$ increase together.

### How are the function's increasing and decreasing behaviors visually represented in the right graph?

In the right graph, two nearby points, $x$ and $x + dx$, get mapped under the function $f$. The slope $\frac{dy}{dx}$ indicates the behavior: if $\frac{dy}{dx}>0$, the function is locally increasing; if $\frac{dy}{dx}<0$, the function is locally decreasing.
