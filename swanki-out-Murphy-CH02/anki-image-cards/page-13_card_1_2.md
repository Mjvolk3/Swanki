Box plots show the summary statistics of the data, including the median, interquartile range (IQR), and potential outliers. Violin plots, in contrast, combine a kernel density plot with a box plot to illustrate the data density at different values, providing a more detailed view of the data distribution.

## How does Figure 2.7 illustrate the variability of datasets with the same summary statistics?

Figure 2.7 demonstrates the variability by displaying scatter plots, box plots, and violin plots for seven different datasets. Despite having the same summary statistics, the scatter plots reveal distinct patterns and structures, which are further nuanced by the violin plots compared to the box plots.
