The left plot labeled as (a) displays the cumulative distribution function (cdf) for the standard normal distribution, \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\). The x-axis represents the variable \(x\) ranging from approximately -3 to 3, and the y-axis represents the cumulative probability from 0 to 1. The curve smoothly increases from left to right, illustrating the probability that a random variable \(X\) drawn from the distribution will have a value less than or equal to \(x\).

### Anki Card 2

**Q: What does the shaded area in the right plot of Figure 2.2 represent in the context of the probability density function (pdf) for the standard normal distribution \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\)?**

The shaded areas under the curve at both tails of the right plot, labeled as (b), represent \(\alpha / 2\), corresponding to the tails of the distribution. These areas are symmetric around the mean (which is 0 for the standard normal distribution). The unshaded region under the curve represents the probability mass of \(1 - \alpha\), typically used to denote the central region within which the majority of the distribution's values fall. This concept is often utilized in confidence interval calculations.
