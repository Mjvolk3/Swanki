In chart (a), the Gaussian distribution, Laplace distribution, and Student's t-distributions are compared. The tails of the Student's t-distributions are heavier than those of the Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Specifically:
- The Gaussian ($\mathcal{N}(0,1)$) is denoted by a dotted line.
- The Student's t-distribution with $\nu=1$ (equivalent to a Cauchy distribution) is shown with dashed lines.
- The Student's t-distribution with $\nu=2$ is shown with dot-dashed lines.
- The Laplace distribution $(0, 1/\sqrt{2})$ is represented as a solid line.

This illustrates the Gaussian distribution having lighter tails compared to the Student's t-distributions, which implies that the latter assigns more probability to extreme events, making them potentially more robust to outliers.

### What is the effect of the logarithmic transformation on the probability density functions as shown in the log-pdf plot?

In chart (b), the log-pdfs are plotted, showing the logarithmic transformation of the distributions. This emphasizes the tails of the distributions, highlighting differences more clearly:
- The Gaussian distribution appears as a smooth curve, revealing its faster decay rate in the tails compared to other distributions.
- The Student's t-distribution with $\nu=1$ (Cauchy), shown with dashed lines, and $\nu=2$, with dot-dashed lines, illustrate heavier tails.
- The Laplace distribution exhibits tails heavier than the Gaussian but lighter than the Student's t-distributions.

The log-pdf representation demonstrates that the Student's t-distributions assign higher probabilities to extreme values, emphasizing their robustness to outliers.
