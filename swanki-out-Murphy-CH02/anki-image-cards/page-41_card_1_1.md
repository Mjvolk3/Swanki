## Back of Card 1

Figure 2.24 illustrates the distribution transformation of \( y = x^2 \) where \( p(x) \) is uniformly distributed. The left plot shows the uniform distribution \( p(x) \). The middle plot displays the analytic result of the distribution \( p(y) \), and the right plot shows the Monte Carlo approximation of \( p(y) \). The Monte Carlo method approximates the distribution via random sampling, initially developed in statistical physics and now widely used in statistics and machine learning.

How do Monte Carlo methods compare to analytic solutions in terms of distribution approximations? Use Figure 2.24 as a reference.

## Back of Card 2

In Figure 2.24, the Monte Carlo approximation (right plot) is compared to the analytic result (middle plot) of the distribution \( p(y) \) where \( y = x^2 \) and \( p(x) \) is uniform. Monte Carlo methods, which approximate distributions through random sampling, generally align well with analytic solutions but can provide empirical distributions where analytic solutions are challenging to derive. This method is especially beneficial for complex, multidimensional integrations commonly encountered in statistical physics, statistics, and machine learning.
