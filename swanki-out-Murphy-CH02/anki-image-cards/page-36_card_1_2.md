The image illustrates that when $$\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{I}$$ (the identity matrix) and $$\boldsymbol{b}\neq\mathbf{0}$$ (a non-zero vector), the affine transformation applies a translation to the unit square without any scaling or rotation. The original green square is shifted in space to form the blue square, indicating the transformation only involves a translation of the space, without altering the shape or size of the square.

The image illustrates that when $$\mathbf{A}$$ is not the identity matrix and $$\boldsymbol{b}=\mathbf{0}$$ (zero vector), the affine transformation applies a combination of scaling, rotation, and possibly shearing to the unit square. This transformation changes the green square into a parallelogram on the blue plane, representing the impact of the transformation matrix $$\mathbf{A}$$ on the shape. The area of the parallelogram is determined by the determinant of $$\mathbf{A}$$.
