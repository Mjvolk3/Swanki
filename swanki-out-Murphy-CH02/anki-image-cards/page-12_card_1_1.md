The datasets in the Datasaurus Dozen differ visually in their distributions and shapes. While each dataset shares identical low order summary statistics, such as mean and standard deviation, they exhibit drastically different structures. The visual differences include varied shapes such as a dinosaur, lines, a star, a circle, and slanted patterns. This demonstrates the importance of data visualization, as numerical summaries alone may not reveal critical differences in data distributions.

The Datasaurus Dozen illustrates that datasets with identical low order summary statistics (such as mean, variance, and correlation) can exhibit significantly different visual patterns when plotted. This emphasizes the critical importance of data visualization in revealing the underlying distribution and structure of the data, which might not be evident from numerical summaries alone. The concept highlights that relying solely on statistical measures can be misleading without proper visualization.
