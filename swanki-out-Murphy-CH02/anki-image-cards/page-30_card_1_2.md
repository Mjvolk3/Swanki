Figure 2.16 illustrates the impact of outliers on plotting various distributions:

1. In plot (a) without outliers, the Gaussian and Student distributions appear nearly identical, aligning closely with each other.
2. In plot (b) with outliers, the Gaussian distribution is significantly more perturbed, while the Student and Laplace distributions maintain their robustness, showing less deviation from their original fits.

## Which distributions are more robust to outliers: Gaussian, Student, or Laplace?

The Student and Laplace distributions are more robust to outliers when compared to the Gaussian distribution. In the presence of outliers, the Gaussian distribution's fit is significantly affected, whereas the fits of the Student and Laplace distributions show minimal change.
