## How does the shape of the Beta distribution change with different parameters?

- If $a<1$, the distribution shows a "spike" on the left.
- If $b<1$, the distribution shows a "spike" on the right.
- If $a=b=1$, the distribution is uniform.
- If $a>1$ and $b>1$, the distribution is unimodal.

## What do the different shapes in the Gamma distribution PDFs indicate about the parameters?

The Gamma distribution PDFs shown indicate that:

- Variations in the shape parameter 'a' alter the skewness and peak of the distribution.
- A higher rate parameter 'b' (increasing from 1.0 to 2.0) shifts the mode leftward along the x-axis.
- Different combinations of 'a' and 'b' can result in a range of distribution shapes, from exponential-like to more bell-curved forms.
