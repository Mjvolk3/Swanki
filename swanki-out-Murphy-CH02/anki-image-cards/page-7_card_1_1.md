### What is being visualized in Figure 2.3, and how does this aid in understanding the relationship between two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$?

Figure 2.3 visualizes the concept of unconditional (or marginal) independence between two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$. It shows:

- The joint probability distribution $P(X, Y)$ of $X$ and $Y$ as a grid where $X$ has 6 possible states and $Y$ has 5 possible states.
- The marginal probability distributions $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$ as smaller grids obtained by summing over rows and columns of $P(X, Y)$ respectively.

The figure illustrates that the joint distribution can be factorized as $p(x, y) = p(x)p(y)$, confirming the independence of $X$ and $Y$. This reduces the number of parameters needed to define the joint distribution from 29 to 9.
