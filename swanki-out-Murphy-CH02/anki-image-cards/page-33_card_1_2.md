Figure (a) showcases the empirical probability density function (pdf) derived from a set of $N=5$ samples, represented with vertical arrows indicating delta functions at each sample point. Figure (b) illustrates the empirical cumulative distribution function (cdf) with a staircase function that steps upward by $1/N$ at each sample point, $N$ being 5 in this case.

## How is the empirical cdf represented in the given image?

The empirical cdf in Figure (b) is represented as a staircase function. Each upward step occurs at the sample points $x^{(n)}$ with a height increment of $1/5$, corresponding to the five samples ($N=5$). The sample points are highlighted with hollow circles, and the increments are marked with filled circles.
