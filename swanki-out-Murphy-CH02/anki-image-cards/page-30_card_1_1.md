What does Figure 2.16 illustrate regarding the effect of outliers on Gaussian, Student, and Laplace distributions?

Figure 2.16 illustrates the effect of outliers on fitting Gaussian, Student, and Laplace distributions as follows:

- **Plot (a) No Outliers**: The Gaussian and Student t-distribution fits are almost identical, indicating similar performance when there are no outliers.
- **Plot (b) With Outliers**: The Gaussian distribution is significantly affected by outliers, with its curve drawn towards the tails. In contrast, the Student t-distribution and Laplace distribution show greater robustness to outliers, with their shapes remaining relatively stable.

This demonstrates that the Student's t-distribution and Laplace distribution are more robust to outliers compared to the Gaussian distribution, which is more sensitive to extreme values.
