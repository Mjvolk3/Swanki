The histogram in Figure 2.23(a) shows the distribution of sample means where each sample mean is calculated from $N=1$ draws of a random variable following a $\operatorname{Beta}(1,5)$ distribution. This demonstrates that with $N=1$, the sample mean distribution directly reflects the underlying $\operatorname{Beta}(1,5)$ distribution. As $N$ increases, according to the Central Limit Theorem, this distribution will tend towards a Gaussian (normal) distribution.

## How does the distribution of $\hat{\mu}_{N}^{s}$ change as $N$ increases, according to the Central Limit Theorem?

As $N$ increases, the distribution of $\hat{\mu}_{N}^{s}$, the sample mean of $N$ draws from a $\operatorname{Beta}(1,5)$ distribution, tends towards a Gaussian (normal) distribution. Initially, with $N=1$, the distribution mirrors the underlying Beta distribution. As $N \to \infty$, the Central Limit Theorem asserts that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution regardless of the original distribution of the data.
