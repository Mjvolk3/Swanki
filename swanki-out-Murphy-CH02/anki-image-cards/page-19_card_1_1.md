Describe the sigmoid (logistic) function, including its formula, properties, and practical applications.

%

The sigmoid (logistic) function $\sigma(a)$ is defined as:

$$
\sigma(a) = \left(1 + e^{-a}\right)^{-1}
$$

Properties:
1. It maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1.
2. The derivative is given by $\frac{d}{d x} \sigma(x) = \sigma(x)(1 - \sigma(x))$.
3. The inverse function is $\sigma^{-1}(p) = \log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right)$, known as the logit function.
4. Related function: $\sigma_+(x) = \log\left(1 + e^x\right)$, known as the softplus function, with its derivative being $\frac{d}{d x} \sigma_+(x) = \sigma(x)$.

Practical Applications: Used extensively in machine learning for binary classification problems as an activation function in neural networks.

## Characteristics and Usage of the Heaviside Function

What is the Heaviside function and its primary application?

%

The Heaviside function $\mathbb{I}(a > 0)$ is a step function defined as:

$$
\mathbb{I}(a > 0) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } a > 0 \\ 
0 & \text{if } a \leq 0 
\end{cases}
$$

Key Characteristics:
1. Non-continuous: It abruptly changes value at $a = 0$.
2. Simplified representation of switching behaviors or binary states.

Primary Application: Used in control systems, signal processing, and mathematical modeling to represent sudden changes or thresholds.
