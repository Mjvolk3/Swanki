What does the bar chart depict in Figure 2.22 regarding the probability distribution?

%

The bar chart in Figure 2.22 represents the probability distribution of the sum of two dice rolls, denoted as $y = x_1 + x_2$ where $x_i \sim \operatorname{Unif}(\{1, 2, \ldots, 6\})$. The x-axis shows possible sums (2 to 12), and the y-axis shows the probabilities of these sums both as decimal fractions and as ratios out of 36 (total possible outcomes). The highest probability occurs for the sum of 7, with a symmetrical decrease on either side, indicating the sums' decreasing likelihood toward the extremes.

## Probability of Sum of Two Dice Rolls

Explain why the sum of 7 has the highest probability in the distribution of two dice rolls.

%

In the distribution of the sum of two dice rolls, the sum of 7 has the highest probability because there are six different combinations of two dice that result in this sum: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1). Each combination is equally likely, making the probability of rolling a sum of 7 equal to $\frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$.
