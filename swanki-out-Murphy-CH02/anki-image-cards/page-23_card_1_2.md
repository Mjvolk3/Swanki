The logistic regression shown in the image represents a 3-class, 2-feature classification on the Iris dataset. The horizontal axis represents petal length, and the vertical axis represents petal width. The different shapes and colors indicate the three species of Iris flowers:

- Green triangles represent Iris Virginica.
- Yellow circles represent Iris Versicolor.
- Blue squares represent Iris Setosa.

The background gradient and contour lines indicate the probabilities associated with each class, with the boundaries showing where the model's predicted probabilities for the different classes are equal. This results in linear decision boundaries, showing where the logistic regression model changes its classification from one species to another. The plot highlights that Iris Setosa is well-separated from the other two species, while there is some overlap between Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor.

## What are the mathematical constraints satisfied by the softmax function as depicted in the logistic regression image?

The softmax function maps $\mathbb{R}^{C}$ to $[0,1]^{C}$ and satisfies the following constraints:

$$
0 \leq \operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{a})_{c} \leq 1 \quad \text{for all} \; c
$$

and

$$
\sum_{c=1}^{C} \operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{a})_{c} = 1
$$

This ensures that the output of the softmax function constitutes valid probability distributions over the $C$ classes.
