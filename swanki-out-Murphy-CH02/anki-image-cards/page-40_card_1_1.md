Explain the significance of this histogram in the context of the Central Limit Theorem where $N=1$.

The histogram shows the distribution of sample means $\hat{\mu}_{N}^{s}=\frac{1}{N_{\mathcal{D}}} \sum_{n=1}^{N_{\mathcal{D}}} x_{n s}$ where $x_{n s} \sim \operatorname{Beta}(1,5)$, for $s=1: 10000$ with $N=1$. Since $N=1$, the histogram illustrates the raw distribution of the Beta(1,5) variable without much smoothing. This setup is used to demonstrate that as $N$ increases, the distribution will eventually approximate a Gaussian, as stated by the Central Limit Theorem.
