Compare and contrast the distributional properties of the Gaussian, Student's t-distribution (for \(\nu=1\) and \(\nu=2\)), and Laplace distributions as shown in Figure 2.15(a).

In Figure 2.15(a), the shapes of the distributions are compared with the following properties:

- **Gaussian Distribution \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\)**: A dotted line, symmetrical about the mean (0) with light tails.
- **Student's t-Distribution \(\mathcal{T}(\mu=0, \sigma=1, \nu=1)\)**: A dashed line, heavier tails compared to Gaussian, equivalent to the Cauchy distribution.
- **Student's t-Distribution \(\mathcal{T}(\mu=0, \sigma=1, \nu=2)\)**: A dot-dashed line, also heavier tails but less so than \(\nu=1\).
- **Laplace Distribution \((0,1/\sqrt{2})\)**: A solid line, resembles an exponential distribution on each side of the mean, with sharper peak and heavier tails than Gaussian, but different structure from Student's t-distributions.

## Logarithmic Perspective on Probability Distributions

What does the logarithmic transformation of the probability density functions (Figure 2.15(b)) reveal about the tails of the Gaussian, Student's t-distributions, and Laplace distributions?

In Figure 2.15(b), the log-pdfs highlight the following:

- **Gaussian Distribution \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\)**: Demonstrates light, exponentially decaying tails.
- **Student's t-Distribution \(\mathcal{T}(\mu=0, \sigma=1, \nu=1)\)**: Shows very heavy tails (logarithmic view underlines its power-law tails), implying higher likelihood of extreme values.
- **Student's t-Distribution \(\mathcal{T}(\mu=0, \sigma=1, \nu=2)\)**: Also displays heavy tails, but less extreme than \(\nu=1\).
- **Laplace Distribution \((0,1/\sqrt{2})\)**: Exhibits exponential tails, heavier than Gaussian but lighter compared to Student's t-distributions.

These comparisons emphasize the robustness of the Student's t-distributions to outliers due to heavier tails, contrasted with the Gaussian and Laplace distributions.
