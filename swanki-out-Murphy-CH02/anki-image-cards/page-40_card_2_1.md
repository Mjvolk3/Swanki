Explain the distribution trend shown in the histogram according to the central limit theorem.

%

The histogram demonstrates the central limit theorem by showing the distribution of sample means \(\hat{\mu}_{N}^{s} = \frac{1}{N_{\mathcal{D}}} \sum_{n=1}^{N_{\mathcal{D}}} x_{ns}\), where \(x_{ns} \sim \operatorname{Beta}(1,5)\). For \(s=1:10000\), as \(N_{\mathcal{D}}\) approaches infinity, the distribution of these means trends towards a Gaussian distribution. This specific histogram is labeled (b) and shows the distribution for \(N=5\).

In the context of the central limit theorem, what does the histogram represent when \(N=5\)?

%

The histogram represents the distribution of the sample means \(\hat{\mu}_{N}^{s} = \frac{1}{N_{\mathcal{D}}} \sum_{n=1}^{N_{\mathcal{D}}} x_{ns}\) for \(x_{ns} \sim \operatorname{Beta}(1,5)\) and \(s=1:10000\) when the number of samples \(N_{\mathcal{D}}\) is 5. It illustrates how, as we increase the number of sample means \(N_{\mathcal{D}}\), the resulting distribution approximates a Gaussian distribution.
