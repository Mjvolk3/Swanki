The logistic regression plot shows the probability of an iris flower being classified as either Virginica or not Virginica based on its petal width. Key elements include:
- Petal width (horizontal axis)
- Probability (vertical axis)
- Solid green curve (probability of being Virginica)
- Dashed blue curve (probability of not being Virginica)
- Vertical dashed line around 1.7 cm representing the decision boundary
- Triangular markers indicating actual data points from the dataset

### Card 2

**Q: What is the significance of the vertical dashed line at approximately 1.7 cm in the logistic regression plot applied to the Iris dataset?**

The vertical dashed line at approximately 1.7 cm represents the decision boundary where the probability of an iris being classified as Virginica intersects with the probability of it being classified as not Virginica. At this point, the probability for both classes is 0.5. Moving away from this boundary increases the model's confidence in classifying an iris as either Virginica or not Virginica based on petal width.
