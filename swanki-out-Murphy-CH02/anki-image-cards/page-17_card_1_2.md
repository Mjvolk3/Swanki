A single 2D line-drawing can be consistent with multiple 3D structures because of the inherent ambiguity in projecting a 3D shape onto a 2D surface. Different 3D shapes can produce the same 2D projection when viewed from specific angles. This is a significant challenge in perception and computer vision, an example of an inverse problem where we aim to determine the true 3D shape from its 2D representation.

## Explain how probability theory helps solve the ambiguity in inferring 3D structures from 2D projections.

Probability theory, specifically Bayes' rule, is used to predict a distribution over possible outcomes given certain assumptions or knowledge about the state of the world. In the context of inferring 3D structures from 2D projections, probability theory helps to infer the most likely 3D shape by considering all possible 3D shapes that could produce the observed 2D projection and assigning probabilities to each based on prior knowledge and observed data.
