In the context of linear regression, homoscedasticity refers to the assumption that the variance of the errors or residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variable. In the image, this is illustrated by the two parallel green lines around the red regression line, which do not change in width as they extend along the x-axis. This implies that the spread or variability of the data points around the regression line is uniform throughout.

## Describe the Gaussian conditional density model used in regression as described in the text.

The Gaussian conditional density model in regression is given by:

$$
p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})=\mathcal{N}\left(y \mid f_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}), f_{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})^{2}\right)
$$

Here, $f_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})$ predicts the mean, and $f_{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})^{2}$ predicts the variance. This model allows the regression to account for varying degrees of uncertainty in predictions, making it possible to model input-dependent variances (heteroscedasticity) in addition to the mean relationship.
