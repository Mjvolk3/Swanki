#### How many parameters are required to define the joint distribution $p(x, y)$ for two independent random variables $X \perp Y$ given that $X$ has 6 possible states and $Y$ has 5 possible states?

For independent random variables, the number of parameters required is $(6 - 1) + (5 - 1) = 9$.

#### Describe the difference in the number of parameters required to define a general joint distribution versus an independent joint distribution for discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ with 6 and 5 possible states, respectively.

A general joint distribution on two such variables would require $(6 \times 5)-1 = 29$ parameters. For independent random variables, only $(6 - 1) + (5 - 1) = 9$ parameters are needed.
