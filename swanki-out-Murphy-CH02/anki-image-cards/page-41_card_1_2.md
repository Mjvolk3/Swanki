What does Figure 2.24 illustrate regarding the transformation of the distribution of $x$ under the function $y = x^2$?

%

Figure 2.24 illustrates the transformation of a uniform distribution \( p(x) \) of \( x \) under the function \( y = x^2 \). The left plot shows the uniform input distribution \( p(x) \). The middle plot shows the analytic result of the transformed distribution \( p(y) \) of \( y \). The right plot demonstrates the Monte Carlo approximation of \( p(y) \), obtained by sampling and squaring values drawn from \( p(x) \).

How does the central limit theorem apply to the context of the sample means shown in figure (a) and (b)?

%

Figures (a) and (b) demonstrate the central limit theorem by showing that as the number of samples \( N \) increases, the distribution of the sample mean \( \hat{\mu}_N^s \) approaches a Gaussian distribution. Specifically, figure (a) corresponds to \( N=1 \) and results in a distribution shaped by the underlying Beta distribution \( \text{Beta}(1,5) \), while figure (b) shows that for \( N=5 \), the distribution begins to approximate a Gaussian shape.
