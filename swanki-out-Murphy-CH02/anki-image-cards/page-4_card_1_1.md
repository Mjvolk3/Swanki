Graph (a) displays a uniform distribution where $p(x = k) = 1/4$ for each \( x \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \). This means each outcome is equally likely. Graph (b) depicts a degenerate distribution (delta function), where all the probability mass is concentrated on \( x = 1 \). Here, $p(x = 1) = 1$ and $p(x = k) = 0$ for all other \( x \).

## What is the main difference between the distributions in the two graphs shown?

The main difference is that graph (a) represents a uniform distribution where every outcome in the state space $\mathcal{X} = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ is equally likely with probability $p(x = k) = 1/4$, while graph (b) represents a degenerate distribution where all probability mass is concentrated on a single outcome, \( x = 1 \), with $p(x = 1) = 1$ and $p(x = k) = 0$ for all other \( x \).
