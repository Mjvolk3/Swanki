Explain the inverse problem illustrated by planar line-drawings in the context of 3-D structure inference.

%

Any planar line-drawing is geometrically consistent with infinitely many three-dimensional (3-D) structures. This means that a 2-D projection of a 3-D object can correspond to multiple possible 3-D shapes. This inverse problem can be approached using probability theory to predict a distribution over possible 3-D outcomes from the given 2-D representation.

## Utilization of probability theory in solving inverse problems

How is probability theory applied to solve inverse problems in the context of recovering 3-D structures from 2-D images?

%

Probability theory is used to predict a distribution over outcomes $y$ given knowledge or assumptions about the state of the world, $h$. In the context of recovering 3-D structures from 2-D images, this involves using Bayes' rule to infer the most likely 3-D shape that could result in the observed 2-D projection.
