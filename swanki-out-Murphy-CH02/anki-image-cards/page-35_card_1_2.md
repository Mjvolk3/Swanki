(a) and (b) show the process of mapping a uniform probability density function using the function $f(x)=2x+1$.

What is the effect of the transformation $f(x) = 2x + 1$ on the initial uniform pdf $p(x)$?

%

The transformation $f(x) = 2x + 1$ maps the original uniform pdf $p(x)$, which has a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, into a new uniform pdf $p(y)$ between 1 and 3. This transformation scales the x-domain by a factor of 2 and shifts it by 1 unit, resulting in the new pdf $p(y)$ with a constant value of 0.5, maintaining the total probability mass.

Describe the local behavior of the function $f(x) = 2x + 1$ based on $\frac{dy}{dx}$.

%

For the function $f(x) = 2x + 1$, the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx} = 2$ is always positive. This indicates that the function is locally increasing everywhere in its domain. If $\frac{dy}{dx}$ were greater than 0, the function would be locally increasing. Conversely, if $\frac{dy}{dx}$ were less than 0, the function would be locally decreasing.
