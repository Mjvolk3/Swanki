### Question 1
What does Figure 2.11 from the logistic regression model applied to a 1-dimensional, 2-class version of the Iris dataset represent, and what are the key features of this graph?

Figure 2.11 represents the application of logistic regression to classify Iris flowers based on petal width. Key features include:

- The horizontal axis represents petal width in centimeters.
- The vertical axis represents the probability of classifying the flower.
- The solid green line indicates the probability of an iris being of the Virginica species.
- The dashed blue line represents the probability of an iris not being of the Virginica species.
- A decision boundary is at approximately 1.7 cm on the petal width axis where the probabilities intersect at 0.5.
- Triangular markers on the top and bottom edges likely represent actual data points, showing their classification according to petal width.

### Question 2
Explain the significance of the decision boundary in logistic regression as shown in Figure 2.11, and what role does petal width play in this context?

The decision boundary in logistic regression, as shown in Figure 2.11, is a critical threshold where the model predicts the probability of an iris being of the Virginica species versus not being Virginica. The decision boundary at approximately 1.7 cm petal width signifies the point where the probabilities for the two classes intersect at 0.5, meaning there's an equal chance of the flower being classified into either category. As petal width deviates from 1.7 cm, the model's confidence in its classification increases, illustrating the impact of petal width on the classification outcome.
