The probability distribution of the sum of two dice rolls, $p(y)$ where $y = x_1 + x_2$ and $x_i \sim \operatorname{Unif}(\{1,2,\ldots,6\})$, is as follows:

- 2: $1/36$
- 3: $2/36$
- 4: $3/36$
- 5: $4/36$
- 6: $5/36$
- 7: $6/36$
- 8: $5/36$
- 9: $4/36$
- 10: $3/36$
- 11: $2/36$
- 12: $1/36$

This distribution forms a symmetric triangle with the highest probability at the sum of 7.

## Which sum of two dice rolls has the highest probability and why?

The sum of two dice rolls that has the highest probability is 7. This is because there are six different dice combinations that produce the sum of 7 (i.e., $(1,6)$, $(2,5)$, $(3,4)$, $(4,3)$, $(5,2)$, and $(6,1)$), resulting in a probability of $6/36$ or $1/6$.
