Explain the visual representation in Figure 2.18 pertaining to empirical pdf and cdf.

Figure 2.18 illustrates the empirical probability density function (pdf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) derived from a set of $N=5$ samples:

- **Sub-figure (a): Empirical pdf**
  - Displays an approximation of the underlying probability density.
  - Vertical dashed arrows indicate delta functions at the five sample points `x^{(n)}`, where `n` runs from 1 to 5.
  
- **Sub-figure (b): Empirical cdf**
  - Depicts a staircase function stepping upward at each sample point.
  - Each step's height is $\frac{1}{5}$, matching the cumulative increment of $1/N$ when $N = 5$.
  - Hollow circles mark the sample points, whereas filled circles indicate the incremental steps.
