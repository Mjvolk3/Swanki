(a) The uniform pdf is mapped through the function $f(x) = 2x + 1$, resulting in a linear transformation of the input interval.

(b) When analyzing the mapping of two nearby points, $x$ and $x + dx$, through $f(x)$, if $\frac{dy}{dx} > 0$, the function is locally increasing. Conversely, if $\frac{dy}{dx} < 0$, the function is locally decreasing.
