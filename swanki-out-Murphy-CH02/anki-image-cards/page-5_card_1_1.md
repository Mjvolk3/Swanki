Figure 2.2 presents two plots related to the standard normal distribution, denoted as $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$:
- (a) The plot on the left is the cumulative distribution function (cdf), which shows the probability that a random variable $X$ drawn from the distribution will have a value less than or equal to $x$. 
- (b) The plot on the right is the probability density function (pdf), characterized by its bell shape, peaking at the mean ($0$). The shaded regions within the tails indicate $\alpha / 2$ of the probability mass, which corresponds to the tails of the distribution.
