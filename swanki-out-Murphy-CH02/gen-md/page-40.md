**## Explain the Central Limit Theorem and how it is depicted in the given figures.**

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of the sample mean $\bar{X}$ approaches a normal distribution as the sample size $N_\mathcal{D}$ increases, regardless of the original distribution of the population. This is depicted in Figure 2.23, where we plot:
$$
\hat{\mu}_{N}^{s}=\frac{1}{N_{\mathcal{D}}} \sum_{n=1}^{N_{\mathcal{D}}} x_{n s}
$$
for $x_{ns} \sim \operatorname{Beta}(1,5)$, showing the convergence to a Gaussian distribution as $N_{\mathcal{D}} \rightarrow \infty$.

**## Derive the standardized form of the sample mean given in the Central Limit Theorem.**

Starting from the sample mean $\bar{X} = \frac{S_{N}}{N}$, the standardized form is given by:
$$
Z_{N_{\mathcal{D}}} \triangleq \frac{S_{N_{\mathcal{D}}}-N_{\mathcal{D}} \mu}{\sigma \sqrt{N_{\mathcal{D}}}} = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{N_{\mathcal{D}}}}
$$
where $S_{N_{\mathcal{D}}}$ is the sum of samples, $\mu$ is the population mean, and $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation. This shows the distribution converges to the standard normal distribution.

**## Explain the concept of Monte Carlo approximation.**

Monte Carlo approximation involves drawing large numbers of samples from a distribution to approximate another distribution. Suppose $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a random variable, and $\boldsymbol{y} = f(\boldsymbol{x})$. We draw samples from $p(\boldsymbol{x})$ and use these to approximate $p(\boldsymbol{y})$. For example, for $x \sim \operatorname{Unif}(-1, 1)$ and $y = f(x) = x^2$, the empirical distribution is given by:
$$
p_{S}(y) \triangleq \frac{1}{N_{s}} \sum_{s=1}^{N_{s}} \delta\left(y-y_{s}\right)
$$

**## What is the generalized form of the sample mean $\bar{X}$ in the Central Limit Theorem?**

The sample mean $\bar{X}$ is given by:
$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i
$$
where $X_i$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. As $N \to \infty$, $\bar{X} \to \mu$, the population mean.

**## Derive the standard error of the mean.**

For the sample mean $\bar{X}$, the standard error is given by:
$$
\text{SE}(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}
$$
where $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, and $N$ is the sample size. This shows how variability in the sample mean decreases with an increasing sample size.

**## How is Monte Carlo approximation applied to approximate the distribution $p(y)$ for $y=f(x)=x^2$ where $x \sim \operatorname{Unif}(-1,1)$?**

Monte Carlo approximation for this problem involves drawing samples $x_s$ from the uniform distribution $x \sim \operatorname{Unif}(-1,1)$, squaring them to get $y_s = f(x_s) = x_s^2$, and computing the empirical distribution:
$$
p_{S}(y) \triangleq \frac{1}{N_{s}} \sum_{s=1}^{N_{s}} \delta\left(y-y_{s}\right)
$$
where $N_s$ is the number of samples. This empirical distribution approximates $p(y)$.
