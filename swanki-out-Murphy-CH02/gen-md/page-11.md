## In the given mixture model, identify and explain $\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]]$ and $\mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]]$ with respect to the given parameters.

In the mixture model:

$$
X = \sum_{y=1}^{K} \pi_{y} \mathcal{N}\left(X \mid \mu_{y}, \sigma_{y}\right)
$$

we have $\pi_{1} = \pi_{2} = 0.5, \mu_{1} = 0, \mu_{2} = 2, \sigma_{1} = \sigma_{2} = 0.5$. Therefore:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]] = \pi_{1} \sigma_{1}^{2} + \pi_{2} \sigma_{2}^{2} = 0.25 \\
& \mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] = \pi_{1}\left(\mu_{1} - \bar{\mu}\right)^{2} + \pi_{2}\left(\mu_{2} - \bar{\mu}\right)^{2} = 1
\end{aligned}
$$

## Explain why the variance of $X$ is dominated by the centroids' differences rather than the local variance around each centroid.

Given the mixture model:

$$
X = \sum_{y=1}^{K} \pi_{y} \mathcal{N}\left(X \mid \mu_{y}, \sigma_{y}\right)
$$

and the results:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]] = 0.25 \\
\mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] = 1
$$

The variance of $X$ is dominated by the differences in the centroids' means as shown by:

$$
\mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] \gg \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]]
$$

indicating that the variance due to the means is larger than the local variance around each centroid.

## Describe what Anscombe's quartet demonstrates about summary statistics.

Anscombe's quartet comprises four datasets that have the same low order summary statistics, specifically mean, variance, and correlation coefficient $\rho$:

$$
\mathbb{E}[x] = 9, \mathbb{V}[x] = 11, \mathbb{E}[y] = 7.50, \mathbb{V}[y] = 4.12, \rho = 0.816
$$

Despite identical statistics, the joint distributions $p(x, y)$ are visually and structurally different, illustrating that summary statistics can be misleading without data visualization.

## What phenomenon is illustrated by the Datasaurus Dozen, and how is it related to Anscombe's quartet?

The Datasaurus Dozen illustrates that datasets can have identical low order statistics like mean and variance but have very different graphical representations, similar to Anscombe's quartet. The 12 datasets, including one that looks like a dinosaur, all have identical low order statistics but very different joint distributions.

## Explain the importance of using both summary statistics and data visualization in statistical analysis.

Anscombe's quartet and the Datasaurus Dozen both highlight that:

- Summary statistics (mean, variance, etc.) can be the same for fundamentally different datasets.
- Visualizing data helps reveal patterns and differences not captured by summary statistics alone.
- Comprehensive analysis should always include both numerical summaries and graphical representations to avoid misleading conclusions.

## Summarize the computation of $\mathbb{V}[X]$ in terms of $\mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]]$ and $\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]]$.

The total variance $\mathbb{V}[X]$ can be split into the variance due to the mean (between-group variance) and the average variance within groups (within-group variance):

$$
\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] + \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]]
$$

For the given parameters, we have:

$$
\mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] = 1 \\
\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]] = 0.25
$$

Therefore, 

$$
\mathbb{V}[X] = 1 + 0.25 = 1.25
$$
