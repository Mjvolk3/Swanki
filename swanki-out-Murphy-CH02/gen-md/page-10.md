## Explain the proof of $\mathbb{E}[X]$ based on conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]]$.

To prove this, let us suppose, for simplicity, that $X$ and $Y$ are both discrete random variables. Then we have

$$
\mathbb{E}_{Y}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] =\mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\sum_{x} x p(X=x \mid Y)\right]
$$

Explain the next steps that lead to the conclusion $\mathbb{E}[X]$.

%
The next steps in the proof are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}_{Y}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]] & = \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\sum_{x} x p(X=x \mid Y)\right] \\
& = \sum_{y} \left[\sum_{x} x p(X=x \mid Y=y)\right] p(Y=y) \\
& = \sum_{x, y} x p(X=x, Y=y) = \mathbb{E}[X]
\end{aligned}
$$

This demonstrates that the expected value of $X$ is $ \mathbb{E}[X]$, a marginal expectation derived from the law of total expectation.

## What is the law of total variance (or the conditional variance formula)?

The law of total variance or conditional variance formula is stated as:

$$
\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}_{Y}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]] + \mathbb{V}_{Y}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]]
$$
Explain the meaning of each term in this equation.

%
In this context:

- $\mathbb{V}[X]$: The total variance of $X$.
- $\mathbb{E}_{Y}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]]$: The expected value of the conditional variance of $X$ given $Y$.
- $\mathbb{V}_{Y}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]]$: The variance of the conditional expectation of $X$ given $Y$.

This formula integrates both the variability within each conditional component and the variability between the conditional expectations.

## Provide the step-by-step proof of the law of total variance.

Let us define the conditional moments, $\mu_{X \mid Y}=\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]$, $s_{X \mid Y}=\mathbb{E}\left[X^{2} \mid Y\right]$, and $\sigma_{X \mid Y}^{2}=\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]=s_{X \mid Y}-\mu_{X \mid Y}^{2}$.

Start the proof by expressing the total variance $\mathbb{V}[X]$ in terms of conditional moments.

%
Starting with the expression for total variance:

$$
\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}\left[X^{2}\right] - (\mathbb{E}[X])^{2}
$$

First, we use the law of total expectation for $X^2$:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[X^{2}\right] = \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[s_{X \mid Y}\right]
$$

Next, noting that $(\mathbb{E}[X])^{2}$ can be rewritten as:

$$
(\mathbb{E}[X])^{2} = \left( \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\mu_{X \mid Y}\right] \right)^{2}
$$

Therefore, the variance can be expanded as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{V}[X] &= \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[s_{X \mid Y}\right] - \left( \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\mu_{X \mid Y}\right] \right)^{2} \\
&= \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[ \sigma_{X \mid Y}^{2} \right] + \mathbb{E}_{Y} \left[ \mu_{X \mid Y}^{2} \right] - \left( \mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\mu_{X \mid Y}\right] \right)^{2} \\
&= \mathbb{E}_{Y} [\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]] + \mathbb{V}_{Y} [\mu_{X \mid Y}]
\end{aligned}
$$

This completes the proof.

## How is the expected duration of a random lightbulb calculated based on conditional expectations?

Suppose $\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=1]=5000$ and $\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=2]=4000$, with $p(Y=1)=0.6$ and $p(Y=2)=0.4$. Calculate $\mathbb{E}[X]$.

%
Using the given information:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = \mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=1] p(Y=1) + \mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=2] p(Y=2)
$$

Substituting the values:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[X] &= 5000 \times 0.6 + 4000 \times 0.4 \\
&= 3000 + 1600 \\
&= 4600
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the expected duration of a random lightbulb is 4600 hours.

## Explain the parameters of a mixture model with two 1D Gaussian components.

Consider a mixture of two 1D Gaussians given by:

$$
p(x) = 0.5 \mathcal{N}(x \mid 0, 0.5) + 0.5 \mathcal{N}(x \mid 2, 0.5)
$$

Describe what each parameter represents.

%
In this mixture model:

- $0.5$: The mixing coefficient for each Gaussian component.
- $\mathcal{N}(x \mid 0, 0.5)$: The first Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance $0.5$.
- $\mathcal{N}(x \mid 2, 0.5)$: The second Gaussian distribution with mean $2$ and variance $0.5$.

The term $p(x)$ represents a probability distribution function that is a weighted combination of two Gaussian distributions.

## Given the law of total expectation, calculate the expected value of $X$ if $\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=y] = a_y$ and $p(Y=y) = b_y$ for discrete $Y$.

Use the law of total expectation $\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{y} \mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=y] p(Y=y)$.

%
Given:

- $\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=y] = a_y$
- $p(Y=y) = b_y$

Substitute these into the law of total expectation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[X] &= \sum_{y} \mathbb{E}[X \mid Y=y] p(Y=y) \\
&= \sum_{y} a_y b_y
\end{aligned}
$$

So the expected value of $X$ is $\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{y} a_y b_y$.
