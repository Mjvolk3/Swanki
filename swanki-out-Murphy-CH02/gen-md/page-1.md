## Probability can be interpreted in two main ways. What are they?

The two main interpretations of probability are the frequentist and Bayesian interpretations:

1. **Frequentist Interpretation**: Probabilities represent long-run frequencies of events that can occur multiple times. E.g., the probability of a fair coin landing heads is interpreted as heads appearing about half the time in many repeated trials.
2. **Bayesian Interpretation**: Probabilities quantify our uncertainty or ignorance about an event. This interpretation facilitates modeling uncertainty about one-off events, like the probability that the polar ice cap will melt by 2030 CE.

## What is the main advantage of the Bayesian interpretation of probability over the frequentist interpretation?

The Bayesian interpretation of probability can model our uncertainty about one-off events that do not have long-term frequencies. For instance, it can quantify the probability that a unique event, such as the polar ice cap melting by 2030 CE, will occur.

## Define probability in the Bayesian interpretation and explain how it relates to information theory.

In the Bayesian interpretation, probability is used to quantify our uncertainty or ignorance about an event. This view fundamentally relates probability to information theory, where the focus is on modeling our belief or knowledge about the event rather than relying on repeated trials.

## Types of Uncertainty: Describe the two fundamentally different reasons for the uncertainty in predictions.

The uncertainty in predictions can arise due to:

1. **Ignorance of Underlying Causes**: Our lack of knowledge about the hidden causes or mechanisms generating the data.
2. {Second reason to be discussed next}

## (Cloze) The frequentist interpretation of probability represents {{c1::long-run frequencies of events}} that can happen multiple times, whereas the Bayesian interpretation quantifies {{c1::our uncertainty or ignorance}} about an event.

## Explain how the rules of probability theory apply to both the frequentist and Bayesian interpretations.

The basic rules of probability theory are the same regardless of whether the frequentist or Bayesian interpretation is adopted. This means that while the interpretations of what probability represents may differ, the fundamental mathematical operations and formulas remain consistent.
