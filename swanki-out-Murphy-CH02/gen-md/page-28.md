## Why is the Gaussian distribution so widely used in statistics and machine learning?

The Gaussian distribution is widely used due to several reasons: it has two easily interpretable parameters (mean and variance), it is supported by the central limit theorem for sums of independent random variables, it has maximum entropy given its mean and variance constraints, and it provides a simple mathematical form that simplifies implementation.

## What are the parameters of a Gaussian distribution?

The parameters of a Gaussian distribution are:

- Mean ($\mu$)
- Variance ($\sigma^2$)

These parameters are crucial for describing the distribution's basic properties.

$$
\mathcal{N}(x \mid \mu, \sigma^{2})
$$

## Explain the central limit theorem's relevance to the Gaussian distribution.

The central limit theorem states that the sum of a large number of independent random variables, each with finite mean and variance, will approximate a Gaussian distribution. This validates the Gaussian distribution as a model for residual errors or "noise".

## What characterizes the maximum entropy property of the Gaussian distribution?

The Gaussian distribution has the maximum entropy for a distribution with a specified mean and variance. This makes it a good default choice when minimal assumptions about the data are desired.

## What is the Dirac delta function, and how is it related to the Gaussian distribution as variance approaches zero?

As the variance of a Gaussian distribution approaches zero, it becomes an infinitely narrow and tall spike at the mean. This limiting behavior is represented by the Dirac delta function:

$$
\lim _{\sigma \rightarrow 0} \mathcal{N}\left(y \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right) \rightarrow \delta(y-\mu)
$$

where the Dirac delta function $\delta(x)$ is defined by:

$$
\delta(x)= 
\begin{cases} 
+\infty & \text { if } x=0 \\ 
0 & \text { if } x \neq 0 
\end{cases},
\qquad
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(x) \, dx = 1
$$

## Define the variant $\delta_y(x)$ of the Dirac delta function and its relationship with $\delta(x-y)$.

A variant of the Dirac delta function, $\delta_y(x)$, is defined as:

$$
\delta_{y}(x)= 
\begin{cases} 
+\infty & \text { if } x=y \\ 
0 & \text { if } x \neq y 
\end{cases}
$$

This function is equivalent to:

$$
\delta_{y}(x) = \delta(x-y)
$$
