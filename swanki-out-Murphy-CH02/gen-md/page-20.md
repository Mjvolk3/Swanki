## Explain the sigmoid function and its necessity in logistic regression.
The sigmoid function $ \sigma(a) $ maps the whole real line to $[0,1]$, making it suitable for outputs that can be interpreted as probabilities. Consider the function:

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}
$$

Why is it necessary to map the whole real line to $[0,1]$ in logistic regression, and how is the sigmoid function defined?
%
Mapping the whole real line to $[0,1]$ is necessary for the output to be interpreted as a probability, which makes it a valid value for the Bernoulli parameter $\theta$. The sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ is defined as:

\[
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}
\]

## Derive the probability expressions for $y = 1$ and $y = 0$ in logistic regression using the sigmoid function.
Derive:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& p(y=1 \mid x, \boldsymbol{\theta})=\sigma(a) \\
& p(y=0 \mid x, \boldsymbol{\theta})=\sigma(-a)
\end{aligned}
$$ 

%
Starting with the sigmoid function:

\[
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}
\]

For $y = 1$:

\[
p(y=1 \mid x, \boldsymbol{\theta})=\frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}} = \sigma(a)
\]

For $y = 0$:

\[
p(y=0 \mid x, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = 1 - \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}} = \frac{e^{-a}}{1 + e^{-a}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{a}} = \sigma(-a)

## Define the Heaviside step function and its relationship to the sigmoid function.
The Heaviside step function $H(a)$ is defined as $ \mathbb{I}(a > 0) $. How does this relate to the sigmoid function?
%
The Heaviside step function $H(a)$ is a function that maps any negative input to 0 and any positive input to 1:

\[
H(a) \triangleq \mathbb{I}(a>0)
\]

The sigmoid function can be considered a "soft" version of the Heaviside step function, smoothly transitioning between 0 and 1 instead of jumping abruptly.

## Explain the log-odds $a$ in the context of logistic regression.
What is $a$ in logistic regression, and how does it relate to the probabilities $p$ and $1-p$?
%
The quantity $a$ is referred to as the log-odds, expressed as:

\[
\log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)
\]

where $p = p(y=1 \mid \boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})$. This relationship is derived as follows:

\[
\log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \log \left( \frac{e^{a}}{1 + e^{a}} \cdot \frac{1 + e^{a}}{1} \right) = \log \left( e^{a} \right) = a

## Describe the relationship between the logistic and logit functions.
Define the logistic (sigmoid) function and its inverse, the logit function.
%
The logistic (or sigmoid) function maps log-odds $a$ to probability $p$:

\[
p = \operatorname{logistic}(a) = \sigma(a) \triangleq \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}
\]

The inverse of the logistic function is the logit function, mapping probability $p$ to log-odds $a$:

\[
a = \operatorname{logit}(p) = \sigma^{-1}(p) \triangleq \log \left( \frac{p}{1 - p} \right)
\]

## Explain the form of the conditional Bernoulli model in binary logistic regression.
Describe the model used in binary logistic regression and define the linear predictor $f(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})$.
%
In binary logistic regression, a conditional Bernoulli model is used with a linear predictor of the form:

\[
f(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \boldsymbol{w}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x} + b
\]

The model has the form:

\[
p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \operatorname{Ber}\left(y \mid \sigma\left(\boldsymbol{w}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x} + b\right)\right)
\]
