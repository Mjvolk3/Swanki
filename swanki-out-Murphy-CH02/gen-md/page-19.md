## Define the sigmoid function, $\sigma(a)$, as used in binary logistic regression.

The sigmoid function is defined as follows:

$$ 
\sigma(a) \triangleq \frac{1}{1+e^{-a}} 
$$

This function maps any real-valued number $a$ into the range $[0,1]$, making it particularly useful for binary classification tasks.

## What is the derivative of the sigmoid function, $\sigma(x)$?

The derivative of the sigmoid function $\sigma(x)$ is given by:

$$ 
\frac{d}{d x} \sigma(x) = \sigma(x)(1-\sigma(x)) 
$$

This property is crucial in the backpropagation algorithm used for training neural networks.

## Explain the relationship between the sigmoid function $\sigma(x)$ and the Heaviside function $\mathbb{I}(a>0)$.

The sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ can be seen as a smooth approximation to the Heaviside step function $\mathbb{I}(a>0)$. The Heaviside function is defined as:

$$
\mathbb{I}(a>0) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } a > 0 \\
0 & \text{if } a \leq 0 
\end{cases}
$$

As $\sigma(a) \approx \mathbb{I}(a>0)$, the sigmoid function can be used to approximate the binary decision process represented by the Heaviside function.

## Derive the inverse of the sigmoid function, known as the logit function.

The inverse of the sigmoid function $\sigma(x)$ is called the logit function and is defined as follows:

$$ 
\sigma^{-1}(p) = \log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) \triangleq \operatorname{logit}(p)
$$

This inversion is useful for transforming probabilities back to the log-odds scale.

## What is the "softplus" function $\sigma_{+}(x)$, and how is it related to the sigmoid function?

The softplus function $\sigma_{+}(x)$ is defined as:

$$ 
\sigma_{+}(x) \triangleq \log \left(1+e^{x}\right) \triangleq \operatorname{softplus}(x) 
$$

The derivative of the softplus function is the sigmoid function:

$$ 
\frac{d}{d x} \sigma_{+}(x) = \sigma(x) 
$$

The softplus function can be considered a smooth approximation to the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function.

## Discuss the use of the sigmoid function in the context of a Bernoulli distribution for binary classification.

In the context of binary classification using a Bernoulli distribution, the probability of output $y$ given input $\boldsymbol{x}$ and parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is modeled as:

$$ 
p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{\theta})=\operatorname{Ber}(y \mid \sigma(f(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})))
$$

Here, $f(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})$ is an unconstrained function predicting the mean parameter of the output distribution, and $\sigma(f(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}))$ ensures the probability lies in the range $[0,1]$.
