## Explain the calculation involved in normalizing the joint distribution to convert it into a posterior distribution.

To compute the posterior distribution $p(H=h \mid Y=y)$, you normalize the joint distribution $p(H=h, Y=y)$ by the marginal probability $p(Y=y)$ for each $h$. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
p(H=h \mid Y=y) = \frac{p(H=h, Y=y)}{p(Y=y)}
$$

## How is Bayes rule formulated in the context of posterior, prior, and likelihood?

Bayes rule can be simplified in words as:

$$
\text{posterior} \propto \text{prior} \times \text{likelihood}
$$

This proportionality indicates we ignore the normalizing constant independent of $H$. Bayesian inference uses Bayes rule to update a belief about unknown values, given observed data.

## What is the sensitivity (true positive rate) in the context of the COVID-19 diagnostic test, given $H$ (infection state) and $Y$ (test result)?

The sensitivity, denoted as $p(Y=1 \mid H=1)$, is the probability of a positive test given that the person is actually infected.

$$
\text{Sensitivity} = p(Y=1 \mid H=1) = 0.875
$$

## What is the specificity (true negative rate) in the context of the COVID-19 diagnostic test, given $H$ (infection state) and $Y$ (test result)?

The specificity, denoted as $p(Y=0 \mid H=0)$, is the probability of a negative test given that the person is not infected.

$$
\text{Specificity} = p(Y=0 \mid H=0) = 0.975
$$

## What does the false positive rate (FPR) denote in the context of diagnostic testing, and how is it calculated using the specificity?

The false positive rate (FPR) is the probability of a positive test result given that the person is not infected, calculated as one minus the specificity:

$$
\text{FPR} = 1 - \text{Specificity} = 1 - 0.975 = 0.025
$$

## What does the false negative rate (FNR) denote in the context of diagnostic testing, and how is it calculated using the sensitivity?

The false negative rate (FNR) is the probability of a negative test result given that the person is infected, calculated as one minus the sensitivity:

$$
\text{FNR} = 1 - \text{Sensitivity} = 1 - 0.875 = 0.125
