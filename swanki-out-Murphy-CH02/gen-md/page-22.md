## Explain the behavior of the softmax distribution at different temperatures.

\\(\operatorname{softmax}(\mathbf{a} / T)\\), where \\(\mathbf{a} = (3,0,1)\\), varies its distribution based on temperature \\(T\\). When the temperature is high (e.g., \\(T=100\\)), the distribution is approximately uniform. Conversely, when the temperature is low (e.g., \\(T=1\\)), the distribution has most of its mass concentrated on the largest element.

## What is the multinomial distribution? Provide its definition including relevant variables and terms.

The multinomial distribution for \\(\mathbf{y} \mid N, \boldsymbol{\theta}\\) is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{M}(\boldsymbol{y} \mid N, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \binom{N}{y_{1} \ldots y_{C}} \prod_{c=1}^{C} \theta_{c}^{y_{c}} = \binom{N}{N_{1} \ldots N_{C}} \prod_{c=1}^{C} \theta_{c}^{N_{c}}
$$

where \\(\theta_{c}\\) is the probability that category \\(c\\) occurs, and

$$
\binom{N}{N_{1} \ldots N_{C}} = \frac{N!}{N_{1}!N_{2}!\cdots N_{C}!}
$$

is the multinomial coefficient.

## What does the multinomial coefficient \\(\binom{N}{N_{1} \ldots N_{C}}\\) represent?

The multinomial coefficient

$$
\binom{N}{N_{1} \ldots N_{C}} = \frac{N!}{N_{1}!N_{2}!\cdots N_{C}!}
$$

represents the number of ways to divide a set of size \\(N = \sum_{c=1}^{C} N_{c}\\) into subsets of sizes \\(N_{1}, N_{2}, \ldots, N_{C}\\).

## State the relationship between the multinomial and categorical distributions.

If \\(N=1\\), the multinomial distribution simplifies to the categorical distribution.

## Define the conditional probability distribution used with the softmax function, using the Cat or multinomial notation.

The conditional probability distribution can be defined as:

$$
p(y \mid \boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \operatorname{Cat}(y \mid f(\boldsymbol{x}; \boldsymbol{\theta})) = \mathcal{M}(\boldsymbol{y} \mid 1, f(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}))
$$

where \\( f(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}) \\) represents the predicted probability vector.

## What is the softmax function and its formula?

The softmax function, also known as the multinomial logit, is defined as:

$$
\operatorname{softmax}(\mathbf{a}) \triangleq \left[\frac{e^{a_{1}}}{\sum_{c'=1}^{C} e^{a_{c'}}}, \ldots, \frac{e^{a_{C}}}{\sum_{c'=1}^{C} e^{a_{c'}}}\right]
$$

where \\(\mathbf{a}\\) is the input vector and \\(C\\) denotes the number of classes.
