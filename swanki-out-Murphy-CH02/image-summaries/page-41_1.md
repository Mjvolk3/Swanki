ChatGPT figure/image summary: The first image presented appears to be a cropped screenshot from a mathematical or statistical paper, discussing the central limit theorem. It is likely to show figures or plots demonstrating the central limit theorem in action, though the image itself is not visible based on the context provided.

The second image (a), corresponding to the label "(a)" in the text, would be expected to display a histogram representing the distribution of sample means \(\hat{\mu}_{N}^{s}\) for \( N=1 \) where each \( x_{n s} \) is sampled from a Beta distribution, specifically \( \text{Beta}(1,5) \).

The second image (b), corresponding to the label "(b)" in the text, would typically show the same concept as (a) but for \( N=5 \). The histograms in both images are intended to demonstrate that as the number of samples \( N_{\mathcal{D}} \) grows, the distribution of the sample mean approaches a Gaussian distribution due to the central limit theorem.

The third image (Figure 2.24) is an illustration of the Monte Carlo approximation. It should contain three plots: The leftmost plot probably displays the uniform distribution \( p(x) \) of \( x \) which is the input to the function \( y=f(x)=x^2 \). The middle plot would be the analytic result of the distribution \( p(y) \) of \( y \), which is the square of \( x \) where \( x \) is uniformly distributed between -1 and 1. And the rightmost plot is likely the Monte Carlo approximation of the distribution of \( y \), showing the empirical distribution obtained from squaring many samples drawn from the uniform distribution of \( x \).

However, I am not able to infer the specific contents of the images themselves without visual access to them.
