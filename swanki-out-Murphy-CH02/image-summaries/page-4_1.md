ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows two bar graphs with four bars each, labeled (a) and (b), representing two discrete probability mass functions (pmfs) on the state space \(\mathcal{X} = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\).

In graph (a), there is a uniform distribution with all four bars at the same height, indicating a probability of \( p(x = k) = 1/4 \) for each of the four possible outcomes \( x = 1, 2, 3,\) and \(4\).

In graph (b), there is a degenerate distribution or delta function, where all the probability mass is placed on the outcome where \( x=1 \). This is depicted with the first bar at height 1 and the remaining three bars at height 0.

This image is used to illustrate the concept of discrete distributions, specifically a uniform distribution and a degenerate distribution within the context of the explanatory text.
