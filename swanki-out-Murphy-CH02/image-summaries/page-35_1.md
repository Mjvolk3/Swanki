ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts a graphical representation of a probability density function (pdf) transformation. On the horizontal axis x, there is the original probability density function (pdf) p(x), which appears to be uniform between 0 and 1, with a value of 1 (this suggests a uniform distribution where each outcome in the interval [0,1] is equally likely). Below the x-axis, there's the transformation function f: R â†’ R, f(x) = 2x + 1, which defines how x values are mapped to y values.

The arrows indicate the mapping of the x domain onto the y domain through the transformation function. As a result, the original pdf is stretched and shifted, creating a new pdf p(y) on the vertical y-axis. The p(y) depicts a uniform distribution between 1 and 3 with a value of 0.5, consistent with the transformation of the unit interval [0,1] to [1,3] and the corresponding scaling of the probability density to maintain the total probability mass.
