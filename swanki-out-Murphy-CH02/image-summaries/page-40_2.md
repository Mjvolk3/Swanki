ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a histogram representing the central limit theorem. It illustrates the distribution trend for sample means \(\hat{\mu}_{N}^{s}\) where each \(x_{n s}\) is drawn from a Beta(1,5) distribution. This specific histogram, labeled (b) with \(N=5\), shows the distribution for the sample means when five samples (\(N=5\)) have been averaged together (\(N_{\mathcal{D}}\) times) for a total of 10,000 times (\(s=1:10000\)). As the number of samples used to calculate the mean increases, the distribution of these means will approach a Gaussian distribution, in accordance with the central limit theorem demonstrated in Figure 2.23 of the referenced academic work. This graph is part of a demonstration to visualize the concept.
