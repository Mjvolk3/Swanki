ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image contains three panels, each displaying a different representation of the same data for seven different datasets labeled A to G.

- The left panel, titled "Raw Data," shows scatter plots for datasets A through G. These plots visualize the data points' dispersion and any patterns within each dataset.
- The middle panel, titled "Box-plot of the Data," presents box plots for each dataset. Box plots are statistical graphics showing the median, interquartile range (IQR), and potential outliers of the distributions.
- The right panel, titled "Violin-plot of the Data," shows violin plots corresponding to each dataset. Violin plots combine a kernel density plot, which shows the density of the data at different values, with a box plot. They provide a more nuanced view of the data distribution than box plots. The shape of each violin plot suggests the frequency of data points at different levels within each dataset.

The purpose of showing these distinct visualizations is to convey how different graphical representations can provide various insights into the same data, as all datasets have the same summary statistics but display very unique structures in the scatter plots.
