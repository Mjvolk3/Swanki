ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a set of three bar graphs, representing the softmax distribution over three classes for a given input vector of scores (logits) \(\boldsymbol{a}=(3,0,1)\), at different temperature values (\(T=100\), \(T=2\), and \(T=1\)). These graphs aim to illustrate the effect of temperature on the softmax function.

- On the left, with \(T=100\), the distribution is almost uniform, meaning that all three classes have similar probabilities. This is due to the high temperature, which makes the softmax output less sensitive to differences in the input scores (logits).
  
- In the middle, with \(T=2\), the difference in the scores has a more pronounced effect, resulting in different probabilities for the three classes. The class corresponding to the highest input score (logit of 3) has a higher probability, but the distribution is still relatively smooth due to the temperature not being too low.

- On the right, with \(T=1\), we see the "winner-takes-all" behavior at a low temperature, where the class with the highest input score is assigned a much higher probability compared to the others, with most of the probability mass focused on this class.

Each bar graph effectively demonstrates how the softmax function can act as a "soft" version of the argmax function, especially at lower temperatures.
