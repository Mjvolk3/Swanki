ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a bar chart representing the probability distribution of the sum of two dice rolls. The x-axis is labeled 'S' and represents the possible sums that can be obtained by rolling two six-sided dice, which range from 2 to 12. The y-axis shows two scales: on the left, we have the probability 'p(S)' of each sum occurring, displayed as a decimal fraction, and on the right, the same probabilities are expressed as ratios out of 36, which is the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice (6 sides per die times 2 dice).

Each bar on the chart corresponds to a sum, starting with 2 all the way up to 12. The height of each bar corresponds to its probability of occurrence. On top of the bars, there are visual representations of dice that add up to the sum associated with each bar. For instance, the bar for the sum of 2 is the shortest, corresponding to a probability of 1/36, since there is only one combination of dice that can result in this sum: a pair of ones. As the sums increase toward the middle of the distribution, the probabilities increase, with the sum of 7 having the highest probability of 6/36 (or 1/6), as there are six different dice combinations that produce this sum. The bars then decrease symmetrically, as the sums become less likely toward the extremes of the distribution.

This histogram is commonly used to teach basic probability and demonstrates the concept of a uniform discrete probability distribution for fair dice. The distribution forms a neat symmetric triangle, which is characteristic of the sum of two uniform distributions with the shape approximating a binomial distribution.
