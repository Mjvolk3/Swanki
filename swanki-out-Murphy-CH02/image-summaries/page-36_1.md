ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts two graphs related to an affine transformation applied to a unit square in the context of multivariate distributions. On the left side (labeled "No Scale, Shift Only"), there's a green square representing the original unit square with coordinates on the axes indicated by \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). This square is shifted without scaling to form the blue square, showing the transformation only involves a translation in the space. Arrows indicate the direction and distance of the shift from the original to the transformed square.

On the right side, we see a transformation where a square is not only shifted but also scaled and possibly rotated, resulting in a parallelogram. The area of this parallelogram is given by the expression "ad-bc," which represents the determinant of the transformation matrix. Here, the points \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \) likely represent the columns of the transformation matrix \( A \), and the point \( (a+c, b+d) \) represents the addition of these columns, showing the combined effect of the transformation on one corner of the unit square.

This image is meant to illustrate the change of variables concept, showing how the affine transformation affects the geometry of the given shapes and how it relates to probability density functions (PDFs) in the multivariate case. The area of the transformed shape is indicative of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix, which is a crucial factor in computing the new PDF after the transformation.
