ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image shows two charts, labeled as Figure 2.15 (a) and (b), depicting probability density functions (pdf) and their logarithmic transformations. Specifically, the charts compare the Gaussian distribution with the Student's t-distribution (for \(\nu=1\) and \(\nu=2\)) and the Laplace distribution.

In chart (a), the pdf is plotted along the y-axis against the variable \( x \) on the x-axis. The charts show the shapes of the different distributions, comparing how their probabilities are distributed over the range of \( x \) values. The Gaussian distribution is shown as a dotted line, and the different Student distributions are shown as dashed and dot-dashed lines, respectively, for \( \nu=1 \) and \( \nu=2 \). The Laplace distribution is plotted as a solid line.

In chart (b), the logarithms of the probability density functions (log-pdfs) are plotted, providing a different perspective that emphasizes the distributions' tails. As before, the different lines represent the corresponding distributions, with the same color and line styles as in chart (a).

The purpose of this comparison is to illustrate the differences in behavior between these distributions, particularly in their tailsâ€”the Student's t-distribution, for example, has heavier tails compared to the Gaussian, which implies it assigns more probability to extreme events, potentially making it more robust to outliers in statistical modeling. The figure is likely used to supplement a discussion on these distributions in the context of probabilistic machine learning.
