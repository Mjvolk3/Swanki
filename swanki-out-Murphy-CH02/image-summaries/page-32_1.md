ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image you provided contains two subfigures labeled (a) and (b), displaying different probability density functions (PDFs) for the Beta and Gamma distributions, respectively.

Subfigure (a) shows the PDFs for various parameters of the Beta distribution, specifically labeled for combinations of 'a' and 'b' parameters that shape the curve: (a=0.1, b=0.1), (a=0.1, b=1.0), (a=1.0, b=1.0), (a=2.0, b=2.0), and (a=2.0, b=8.0). Each curve is assigned a different color, and you can observe how the shape of the Beta distribution changes depending on these parameters, ranging from "spike"-like shapes to more bell-shaped, to skewed distributions based on these values.

Subfigure (b) shows various PDFs for Gamma distributions with shape 'a' and rate 'b' parameters as follows: (a=1.0, b=1.0), (a=1.5, b=1.0), (a=2.0, b=1.0), and then again these same 'a' values paired with a higher rate 'b' value of 2.0. The solid lines represent the PDFs with a rate 'b' of 1.0, while the dashed lines represent those with a rate 'b' of 2.0. Different color codes correspond to the different 'a' values. Here, you can see how the PDF shape changes as we vary both the shape parameter 'a' and the rate 'b', with modes ranging from the origin to further along the x-axis.

Both of these plots serve to illustrate the versatility of the Beta and Gamma distributions in modeling data under a variety of conditions and parameterizations.
