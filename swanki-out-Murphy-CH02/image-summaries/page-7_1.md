ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts a graphical representation of the concept where two random variables, \(X\) and \(Y\), are unconditionally (or marginally) independent. The larger grid labeled \(P(X, Y)\) represents the joint probability distribution of \(X\) and \(Y\). Here, \(X\) has 6 possible states (values), and \(Y\) has 5 possible states, which can be inferred from the grid dimensions.

On the right side of the equality, two smaller grids labeled \(P(X)\) and \(P(Y)\) represent the marginal probability distributions of \(X\) and \(Y\) respectively. These marginal distributions are obtained by summing over the rows for \(P(Y)\) and over the columns for \(P(X)\) in the joint probability distribution. The figure illustrates that the joint distribution can be factorized into the product of the two marginal distributions, showing that the variables are independent. This is a visualization of the product rule of probability for independent random variables, which states that \(p(x, y) = p(x) p(y)\) when \(X \perp Y\).
