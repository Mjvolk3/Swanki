ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image displays two bar graphs illustrating examples of the binomial distribution with \( N = 10 \) trials for different values of probability \( \theta \). On the left, graph (a) shows the binomial distribution with \( \theta = 0.25 \), where the probability of success on any individual trial is 0.25. On the right, graph (b) shows the binomial distribution with \( \theta = 0.9 \), where the probability of success is 0.9. The x-axis represents the number of successes ranging from 0 to 10, and the y-axis represents the probability of observing that number of successes in 10 trials. The different shapes of the distributions reflect the different probabilities of success, with (a) having a more spread out distribution peaking around 2 or 3 successes and (b) having a distribution that is heavily weighted towards a higher number of successes, peaking at 9 or 10.
