ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows two graphs side by side. On the left, graph (a) represents the sigmoid or logistic function, which is a smooth and continuous S-shaped curve that maps any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1. It's labeled "sigmoid function." The horizontal axis likely represents the input to the function, ranging from -4 to 4, while the vertical axis represents the output of the sigmoid function, ranging from 0 to 1. This function is commonly used in machine learning for binary classification problems.

On the right, graph (b) represents the Heaviside function, a step function that jumps from 0 to 1 at a certain point on the horizontal axis, which appears to be at zero. It's labeled "Heaviside function." This function is not smooth or continuous and is typically used to model situations where there is a switch from one state to another at a certain threshold.
