ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image displays a geometric illustration of the change of variables from polar to Cartesian coordinates. It shows a small patch of an area in polar coordinates defined by the radius \( r \) and the angle \( \theta \). The region is bound by the curves from \( r \) to \( r + dr \) (indicating a small change in radius) and the lines from \( \theta \) to \( \theta + d\theta \) (indicating a small change in angle).

The shaded area represents the differential area element in polar coordinates, which can be expressed as \( r dr d\theta \). This expression accounts for the area of the infinitesimal sector-shaped patch in a polar coordinate system, where \( dr \) is the change in the radial direction and \( r d\theta \) is the arc length defining the change in the angular direction, with \( r \) being the radius of the arc. The Cartesian axes are also shown, highlighting how the patch relates to these axes in terms of position.
