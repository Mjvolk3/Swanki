ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image displays two plots, labeled as figure 2.16 (a) and (b), which illustrate the effect of outliers on fitting Gaussian, Student, and Laplace distributions to a dataset. 

In both plots, there are histograms representing some data, and three different curves overlaid on the histograms, which correspond to three types of probability density functions (PDFs) fitted to the data:

1. A dotted line representing a Gaussian (or normal) distribution fit.
2. A dashed line representing a Student's t-distribution fit.
3. A solid line representing a Laplace (double-sided exponential) distribution fit.

Plot (a) shows a situation with no outliers, and you can see that the Gaussian and Student t-distribution lines are very close to each other, indicating that they fit the data similarly when there are no outliers present.

Plot (b) shows what happens when outliers are added to the data. In this case, the Gaussian distribution is visibly more affected by the outliers—its curve is drawn towards the tails by the extreme values. Meanwhile, the Student and Laplace distributions are less influenced, with the latter two showing greater robustness to outliers—their shapes do not change as dramatically as the Gaussian's.

The illustration is meant to convey that both the Student's t-distribution and the Laplace distribution are more robust to outliers compared to the Gaussian distribution, which is sensitive to the presence of outliers and can result in a distorted representation of the main trend of the data.
