ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a graph illustrating a probability density function (PDF) of a mixture of two one-dimensional (1D) Gaussians. The x-axis presumably represents the variable $x$, and the y-axis represents the probability density $p(x)$. The graph shows two distinct peaks, which correspond to the two components of the Gaussian mixture, each with its own mean ($\mu$) and variance ($\sigma^2$), as described in the context.

In the mixture, each Gaussian component is weighted—indicated by the text preceding the image—with a mixing coefficient, here both being 0.5 (suggesting an equal contribution from both components). The means of the Gaussians are at 0 and 2, and both have the same variance of 0.5. The bimodal nature of the PDF is represented by the two peaks on the graph, indicating the presence of two distinct Gaussian distributions within the mixture.
