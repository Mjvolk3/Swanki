ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a histogram representing the distribution of sample means of a random variable drawn from a Beta(1,5) distribution, with the number of draws (N) for the sample mean calculation being 1. This histogram is part of a demonstration of the central limit theorem, illustrating that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample means tends toward a Gaussian (normal) distribution. In this particular case (N=1), the histogram shows the frequency of the outcomes on the vertical axis and the sample mean values on the horizontal axis. This is Figure 2.23 labeled with "(a)" in the provided context, indicating that it is the first of a set of similar histograms corresponding to different values of N.
