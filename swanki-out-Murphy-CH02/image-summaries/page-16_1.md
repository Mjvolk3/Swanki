ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image displays a set of conditional probabilities that describe the host's actions in the Monty Hall problem after the contestant has picked door 1. These probabilities define the likelihood of the host opening door 2 or door 3, given the location of the prize behind one of the three doors (H1, H2, or H3):

- If the prize is behind door 1 (H1), the host has an equal chance of opening door 2 or door 3, since he can't reveal the prize or the door picked by the contestant. Therefore, both outcomes have a probability of 1/2.
- If the prize is behind door 2 (H2), the host cannot open door 2 (since the prize is there), and he cannot open door 1 (since that is the door picked by the contestant). Hence, he has no choice but to open door 3, giving P(Y = 3|H2) = 1 and P(Y = 2|H2) = 0.
- If the prize is behind door 3 (H3), similarly, the host is forced to open door 2, leading to P(Y = 2|H3) = 1 and P(Y = 3|H3) = 0.

These probabilities are used in the application of Bayes' theorem to determine the contestant's best strategy in the Monty Hall problem, which—as the earlier text explains—would be to switch doors after the host opens one.
