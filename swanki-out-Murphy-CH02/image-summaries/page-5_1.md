ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows two plots related to the standard normal distribution, often denoted by \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\).

On the left, labeled as (a), there is a plot of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) for the standard normal distribution. The x-axis represents the variable \(x\) ranging from approximately -3 to 3, and the y-axis represents the cumulative probability from 0 to 1. The curve smoothly increases from left to right, illustrating the probability that a random variable \(X\) drawn from the distribution will have a value less than or equal to \(x\).

On the right, labeled as (b), we have a plot of the probability density function (pdf) corresponding to the same standard normal distribution. The x-axis covers the same range, while the y-axis represents the density of the probability. The characteristic bell-shaped curve is shown, peaking at 0 where the mean of the distribution is located. The shaded areas under the curve at both tails represent \(\alpha / 2\), corresponding to the tails of the distribution; these areas are symmetric around the mean. Thus, the unshaded region under the curve represents the probability mass of \(1 - \alpha\), which in the context provided would typically be the range within which the majority of the distribution's values fall (often used in confidence interval calculations).

These plots are standard tools in statistics to illustrate the distribution's properties and are likely found in a chapter discussing normal distributions and related concepts such as cdf, pdf, and quantiles.
