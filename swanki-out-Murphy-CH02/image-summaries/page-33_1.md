ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image showcases two sub-figures labeled (a) and (b), which serve as illustrations related to the empirical probability density function (pdf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) described in the context provided.

Figure (a) represents the empirical pdf with a curve suggesting the underlying probability density being approximated. Overlaying the curve are vertical dashed lines, each topped with an arrow, pointing to the five samples each denoted by `x^{(n)}` where `n` runs from 1 to 5. These are used to approximate the pdf using delta functions, hence the shape of arrows (spikes) representing the delta functions at the respective sample points.

Figure (b) presents the empirical cdf with a staircase function that steps upward at each of the five sample points `x^{(n)}`. Each step has a height of `1/5`, indicated by the fractional values next to the vertical dashed lines, consistent with the cumulative distribution stepping up by `1/N` at every sample when `N` is 5. The sample points are further emphasized with hollow circles, and the incremental steps are represented by filled circles.

These two figures visually demonstrate the concepts of empirical probability distributions discussed in the text, specifically how a pdf and cdf can be approximated from a finite set of samples.
