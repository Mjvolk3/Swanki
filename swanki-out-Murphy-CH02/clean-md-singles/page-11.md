$X=\sum_{y=1}^{K} \pi_{y} \mathcal{N}\left(X \mid \mu_{y}, \sigma_{y}\right)$. In Figure 2.4, we have $\pi_{1}=\pi_{2}=0.5, \mu_{1}=0, \mu_{2}=2, \sigma_{1}=\sigma_{2}=0.5$. Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}[X \mid Y]]=\pi_{1} \sigma_{1}^{2}+\pi_{2} \sigma_{2}^{2}=0.25 \\
& \mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]]=\pi_{1}\left(\mu_{1}-\bar{\mu}\right)^{2}+\pi_{2}\left(\mu_{2}-\bar{\mu}\right)^{2}=0.5(0-1)^{2}+0.5(2-1)^{2}=0.5+0.5=1
\end{aligned}
$$

So we get the intuitive result that the variance of $X$ is dominated by which centroid it is drawn from (i.e., difference in the means), rather than the local variance around each centroid.

2.2.6 Limitations of summary statistics *
}

Although it is common to summarize a probability distribution (or points sampled from a distribution) using simple statistics such as the mean and variance, this can lose a lot of information. A striking example of this is known as Anscombe's quartet [Ans73], which is illustrated in Figure 2.5. This shows 4 different datasets of $(x, y)$ pairs, all of which have identical mean, variance and correlation coefficient $\rho$ (defined in Section 3.1.2): $\mathbb{E}[x]=9, \mathbb{V}[x]=11, \mathbb{E}[y]=7.50, \mathbb{V}[y]=4.12$, and $\rho=0.816 .{ }^{4}$ However, the joint distributions $p(x, y)$ from which these points were sampled are clearly very different. Anscombe invented these datasets, each consisting of 10 data points, to counter the impression among statisticians that numerical summaries are superior to data visualization [Ans73].

An even more striking example of this phenomenon is shown in Figure 2.6. This consists of a dataset that looks like a dinosaur ${ }^{5}$, plus 11 other datasets, all of which have identical low order statistics. This collection of datasets is called the Datasaurus Dozen [MF17]. The exact values of the $(x, y)$ points are available online. ${ }^{6}$ They were computed using simulated annealing, a derivative free optimization method which we discuss in the sequel to this book, [Mur23].

For the former, we have $\mathbb{V}[x]=10.00, \mathbb{V}[y]=3.75$, for the latter, we have $\mathbb{V}[x]=11.00, \mathbb{V}[y]=4.12$. 5.
