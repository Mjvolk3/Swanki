Figure 2.17: (a) Some beta distributions. If $a<1$, we get a "spike" on the left, and if $b<1$, we get a "spike" on the right. if $a=b=1$, the distribution is uniform. If $a>1$ and $b>1$, the distribution is unimodal. Generated by beta_dist_plot.ipynb. (b) Some gamma distributions. If $a \leq 1$, the mode is at 0 , otherwise the mode is away from 0 . As we increase the rate $b$, we reduce the horizontal scale, thus squeezing everything leftwards and upwards. Generated by gamma_dist_plot.ipynb.

2.7.5 Gamma distribution
}

The gamma distribution is a flexible distribution for positive real valued rv's, $x>0$. It is defined in terms of two parameters, called the shape $a>0$ and the rate $b>0$ :

$$
\operatorname{Ga}(x \mid \text { shape }=a, \text { rate }=b) \triangleq \frac{b^{a}}{\Gamma(a)} x^{a-1} e^{-x b}
$$

Sometimes the distribution is parameterized in terms of the shape $a$ and the scale $s=1 / b$ :

$$
\operatorname{Ga}(x \mid \text { shape }=a, \text { scale }=s) \triangleq \frac{1}{s^{a} \Gamma(a)} x^{a-1} e^{-x / s}
$$

See Figure 2.17b for some plots of the gamma pdf.

For reference, we note that the distribution has the following properties:

$$
\text { mean }=\frac{a}{b}, \text { mode }=\frac{a-1}{b}, \text { var }=\frac{a}{b^{2}}
$$

There are several distributions which are just special cases of the Gamma, which we discuss below.

- Exponential distribution. This is defined by

$$
\operatorname{Expon}(x \mid \lambda) \triangleq \operatorname{Ga}(x \mid \text { shape }=1, \text { rate }=\lambda)
$$

This distribution describes the times between events in a Poisson process, i.e. a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate $\lambda$.
