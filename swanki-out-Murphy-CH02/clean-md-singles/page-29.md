Figure 2.15: (a) The pdf's for a $\mathcal{N}(0,1), \mathcal{T}(\mu=0, \sigma=1, \nu=1), \mathcal{T}(\mu=0, \sigma=1, \nu=2)$, and Laplace $(0,1 / \sqrt{2})$. The mean is 0 and the variance is 1 for both the Gaussian and Laplace. When $\nu=1$, the Student is the same as the Cauchy, which does not have a well-defined mean and variance. (b) Log of these pdf's. Note that the Student distribution is not log-concave for any parameter value, unlike the Laplace distribution. Nevertheless, both are unimodal.

The delta function distribution satisfies the following sifting property, which we will use later on:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(y) \delta(x-y) d y=f(x)
$$

2.7 Some other common univariate distributions *
}

In this section, we briefly introduce some other univariate distributions that we will use in this book.

\subsection*{2.7.1 Student $t$ distribution}

The Gaussian distribution is quite sensitive to outliers. A robust alternative to the Gaussian is the Student $t$-distribution, which we shall call the Student distribution for short. ${ }^{9}$ Its pdf is as follows:

$$
\mathcal{T}\left(y \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}, \nu\right) \propto\left[1+\frac{1}{\nu}\left(\frac{y-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}\right]^{-\left(\frac{\nu+1}{2}\right)}
$$

where $\mu$ is the mean, $\sigma>0$ is the scale parameter (not the standard deviation), and $\nu>0$ is called the degrees of freedom (although a better term would be the degree of normality [Kru13], since large values of $\nu$ make the distribution act like a Gaussian).
\footnotetext{
9. This distribution has a colorful etymology. It was first published in 1908 by William Sealy Gosset, who worked at the Guinness brewery in Dublin, Ireland. Since his employer would not allow him to use his own name, he called it the "Student" distribution. The origin of the term $t$ seems to have arisen in the context of tables of the Student distribution, used by Fisher when developing the basis of classical statistical inference.
