Here are six Anki cards based on the provided text chunk, focusing on the scientific details and mathematical equations:

### Card 1

Given a context where we have $M$ orthogonal eigenvectors corresponding to $M$ eigenvalues, how can any $M$-dimensional vector be represented?

Any $M$-dimensional vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the $M$ orthogonal eigenvectors.

### Card 2

What does the equation $\mathbf{U} \mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}} = \mathbf{I}$ indicate about the matrix $\mathbf{U}$?

The equation $\mathbf{U} \mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}} = \mathbf{I}$ indicates that the matrix $\mathbf{U}$ is an orthogonal matrix. This implies that both the rows and columns of $\mathbf{U}$ are orthonormal vectors.

### Card 3

Express the eigenvector equation in matrix form using $\mathbf{U}$ and the eigenvalue matrix $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$.

$$
\mathbf{A U} = \mathbf{U} \boldsymbol{\Lambda}
$$

Here, $\mathbf{A}$ is the original matrix, $\mathbf{U}$ is the orthogonal matrix formed by eigenvectors, and $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ is the diagonal matrix containing eigenvalues.

### Card 4

What transformation does the orthogonal matrix $\mathbf{U}$ perform on a vector $\mathbf{x}$, and how does it affect the length and angle of the vector?

The orthogonal matrix $\mathbf{U}$ transforms the vector $\mathbf{x}$ into a new vector $\widetilde{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{U} \mathbf{x}$. This transformation preserves the length of the vector and the angle between any two vectors. Specifically:

$$
\widetilde{\mathbf{x}}^{\mathrm{T}} \widetilde{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{U} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}
$$

$$
\widetilde{\mathbf{x}}^{\mathrm{T}} \widetilde{\mathbf{y}} = \mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{U} \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{y}
$$

Thus, $\mathbf{U}$ performs a rigid rotation of the coordinate system.

### Card 5

When we diagonalize a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ using an orthogonal matrix $\mathbf{U}$, what equation do we obtain?

If we diagonalize a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ using an orthogonal matrix $\mathbf{U}$, we obtain:

$$
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{U} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$.

### Card 6

What is the equation for the inverse of matrix $\mathbf{A}$ when it is diagonalized by $\mathbf{U}$ and $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$, and what properties do we use?

For the inverse of $\mathbf{A}$ when it is diagonalized by $\mathbf{U}$ and $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$, we use the equation:

$$
\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mathbf{U} \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{-1} \mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

The properties used here include $\mathbf{U}^{-1} = \mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}}$ due to the orthogonality of $\mathbf{U}$.
