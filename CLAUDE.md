## Coding Advice

- Don't be superfluous
- Don't use try except blocks - fail fast minimize other types of exception coding like by using excessive conditionals

## Pydantic Models

- We want to use pydantic models to structure output as much as possible as opposed to controlling output by changing prompts.

## Files

- Tests should go in `tests/`

## Code Execution

- ~/opt/miniconda3/envs/swanki/bin/Swanki python script.py

## Weekly Notes

- When checking off a task in the weekly note, always add a one-sentence summary before the `[[link]]`. Never leave a checked item as just a bare link.

## Change Log

- This is automatically updated. Don't edit it directly.
