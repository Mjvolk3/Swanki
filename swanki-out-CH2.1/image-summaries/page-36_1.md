ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image shows a set of four differently colored cubical dice, each with numbers on their faces. The die colors are orange, red, blue, and green, and they are arranged in a circular order with arrows between them indicating a cycle. Each die has a unique distribution of numbers:

- The orange die has the numbers 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, and 3.
- The red die has 2, 2, 2, 6, 6, and 6.
- The blue die has 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, and 0.
- The green die has 5, 5, 5, 1, 1, and 1.

The circular arrangement suggests that each die is meant to be "competing" against the next one in the cycle (orange against red, red against blue, blue against green, and green against orange). The numbers are assigned in such a way that each die has a 2/3 probability of rolling a higher number than the preceding die in the cycle, illustrating the concept of non-transitive dice as referred to in Exercise 2.2 of the paper. This property is known as non-transitivity because it contradicts the transitive property of conventional dice, where if die A typically rolls higher than die B, and die B typically rolls higher than die C, then die A should also typically roll higher than die C, which is not the case with these dice.
