ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image displays a graph illustrating two curves representing different mathematical functions related to probability. The horizontal axis is labeled as "x", and there are two curves plotted:

1. A blue curve that fluctuates across the graph labeled as "p(x)" which represents a probability density function (pdf). It shows how the probability density varies with the variable x. This curve is not uniform, indicating that the probability density changes across different values of x.

2. A red curve labeled as "P(x)" which represents a cumulative distribution function (CDF). It is a monotonically increasing function that represents the probability that the random variable X will take a value less than or equal to x.

Also, there's a shaded vertical strip labeled as "δx" which is illustrating an infinitesimally small interval around a particular value of x. The probability that the random variable falls within this interval can be approximated by the area under the blue curve (p(x)) over that interval, indicated by the product "p(x) δx" as δx approaches zero. This graphical representation ties into the explanation of probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions described in the text.
