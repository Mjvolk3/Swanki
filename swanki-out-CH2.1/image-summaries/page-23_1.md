ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a three-part comparison illustrating the effect of a nonlinear transformation on a two-dimensional probability distribution. In the top row, we have three different representations:

- On the left side, there is a grid representing the initial coordinate system with the axes labeled \(x_1\) and \(x_2\). This is the space where the original distribution is defined.
- In the middle, there is a heat map of a Gaussian distribution, where the intensity of the color corresponds to the probability density. The distribution is centered and exhibits a radial symmetry, indicating higher density towards the center.
- On the right side, there is a scatter plot of red points, which are samples drawn from the Gaussian distribution shown in the middle figure. These points are densely concentrated near the center of the plot, consistent with the high probability density of the Gaussian distribution.

In the bottom row, the same three types of representation showcase the transformed variables:

- On the left side, there is a grid now representing the transformed coordinate system with axes labeled \(y_1\) and \(y_2\). The grid lines are distorted, indicating that a nonlinear transformation has been applied.
- In the middle, there is another heat map, now showing the transformed distribution, which has become more complex and multimodal as a result of the nonlinear transformation.
- On the right side, there is another scatter plot of red points, representing the same samples from the top right figure but now plotted in the transformed coordinate space. The scatter plot shows that the points are spread out and assume a more complex structure corresponding to the transformed distribution's heat map.

The general impression from this figure is to demonstrate how the nonlinear change of variables distorts the initial Gaussian distribution and how the corresponding samples are dispersed according to this transformation. The precise mathematical transformation applied to the coordinates is not explained in this image alone but would be detailed in the body of the text accompanying this figure.
