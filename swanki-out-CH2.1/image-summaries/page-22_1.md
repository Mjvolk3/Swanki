ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image illustrates a mathematical concept related to the transformation of probability distributions. On the right side of the image, there is a red curve, representing a Gaussian distribution \( p_x(x) \) as a function of the variable \( x \). Below this curve, there is a histogram in blue that represents a sample of data points drawn from this Gaussian distribution.

On the left side, there is a blue curve labeled \( g^{-1}(x) \), which represents the transformation from \( x \) to \( y \) using a logistic sigmoid function, which is the inverse of the function given by \( x = g(y) = \ln(y) - \ln(1-y) + 5 \).

Additionally, there is a green curve on the left side that represents the Gaussian distribution \( p_x(x) \) transformed as a function of \( y \) through the function \( g^{-1} \), labeled as \( p_x(g(y)) \).

Finally, there's a magenta curve, also on the left side, which represents the actual transformed density \( p_y(y) \) over \( y \), according to the transformation property mentioned in the contextual information. This differs from the green curve as it takes into account the change of variables' effect on the density, leading to a different location for the mode (the peak of the density).

This figure aims to display the difference between simply transforming the Gaussian distribution as a function of \( x \) and the actual transformation of the density over \( y \) which includes the Jacobian determinant factor, resulting in the shift of the mode as visualized by the magenta curve. The shaded areas under the curves likely correspond to the probability mass, and hatched regions might serve to emphasize the differences between the histograms and the actual distributions after transformation.
