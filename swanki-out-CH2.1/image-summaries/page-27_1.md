ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows two histograms representing two different probability distributions over 30 bins. Each histogram visualizes the probability distribution of a discrete random variable by depicting the relative frequencies of the variable falling within each bin. The left histogram is more concentrated around fewer bins with a peak at one particular bin, indicating a distribution with a lower degree of spread, and it has an associated entropy (H) of 1.77. The right histogram appears more spread out across many bins, suggesting a more uniform distribution of probabilities, and has a higher entropy value of 3.09. The histograms serve to illustrate that distributions that are more evenly spread across a wide range of values will have higher entropy, supporting the text's explanation of entropy as a measure of the spread or uncertainty in a probability distribution.
