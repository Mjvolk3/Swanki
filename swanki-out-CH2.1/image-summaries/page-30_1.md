ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image illustrates a graph that is being used to describe the property of a convex function. The graph has two axes, an x-axis labeled "x" and a y-axis that is not labeled but is implied to measure the function value "f(x)." On the graph, there is a curve representing the function f(x), which is shown in red. The curve has a convex shape, meaning it curves upwards.

Additionally, there are two vertical dashed lines in green that intersect the x-axis at points labeled "a" and "b," respectively. These points correspond to values where the curve is defined and are used to form a "chord," which is a straight line in blue connecting the points on the curve directly above "a" and "b." The chord represents a linear interpolation between these two points on the function.

The property of convexity is highlighted by the fact that the blue chord always lies above or on the red convex curve between the points "a" and "b." This characteristic is key to identifying a function as convex, as described in the provided text. Additionally, there is a point "x" between "a" and "b" on the x-axis, which helps show that for any point on the function between "a" and "b," the value of the function is always below the line segment (or chord) that connects the values of the function at "a" and "b." 

The illustration serves as a visual aid in understanding the definition and properties of convex functions, a concept discussed in the text excerpt from the paper. Convex functions are a fundamental concept in mathematics and are particularly important in the field of optimization.
