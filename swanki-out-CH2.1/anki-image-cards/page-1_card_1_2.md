Epistemic uncertainty, derived from the Greek word "episteme" meaning knowledge, refers to uncertainty in machine learning that stems from incomplete understanding or lack of knowledge about the model or the environment. It is sometimes also called systematic uncertainty. This type of uncertainty can potentially be reduced as we gain more knowledge or gather more data.
