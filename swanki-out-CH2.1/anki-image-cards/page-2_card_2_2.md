## Based on Figure 2.1(b), describe the relationship between \(x_1\) and the output \(y\) when \(x_2\) is unobserved.

In Figure 2.1(b), the output \(y\) shows a high degree of variance as a function of \(x_1\) due to the unobserved variable \(x_2\). The plot reveals a noisy distribution, where the absence of information about \(x_2\) leads to an increased spread in the data points along the vertical axis. This reflects the complexity and uncertainty in predicting \(y\) from \(x_1\) alone in a two-dimensional problem when one dimension (in this case \(x_2\)) is unobserved.

## Analyze the impact of Gaussian noise on data visualization in the context of Figure 2.1(b).

In Figure 2.1(b), the addition of Gaussian noise to the output \(y\) significantly affects data visualization by creating a scattered pattern of data points. This scattering obscures any underlying trend that might exist between \(x_1\) and \(y\) when \(x_2\) is not accounted for. Gaussian noise, being randomly distributed with a mean of zero, adds variability and makes it more challenging to discern any clear functional relationship from the plot alone, emphasizing the importance of considering all influencing factors or dimensions in data analysis tasks.
