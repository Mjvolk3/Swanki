## How does the unobservance of \( x_2 \) in the provided data points affect the noise level in the output?

The lack of observation of \( x_2 \) results in higher noise levels in the output measurements. This is because the regression model cannot account for the variance caused by \( x_2 \) since it is not observed, leading to a greater spread and dispersal of data points along the output \( y \). This is evident in Figure 2.1(b) where the data points show increased vertical dispersion due to the missed information about \( x_2 \).

## What is represented on the axes of Figure 2.1(b)?

The horizontal axis represents the variable \( x_1 \) while the vertical axis is labeled \( y \), indicating the measured output or target variable. In this plot, 100 data points are depicted where \( x_2 \) is unobserved, influencing the appearance of the noisy distribution of values along \( y \) due to the unobserved variability contributed by \( x_2 \).
