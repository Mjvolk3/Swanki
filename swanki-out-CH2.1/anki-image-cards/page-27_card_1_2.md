## Given the histograms shown, explain why the distribution on the right has a higher entropy value compared to the one on the left?

The distribution on the right appears more uniform across all bins, suggesting a more even spread of probabilities. Higher entropy, noted as $\mathrm{H}=3.09$, quantitatively reflects greater uncertainty or randomness in this distribution compared to the left. In contrast, the left histogram is more peaked and less uniformly distributed, resulting in lower entropy ($\mathrm{H}=1.77$). A more uniform distribution maximizes entropy because it represents the highest level of unpredictability about the outcome.

## What is the formula for entropy $\mathrm{H}$ used in this context and how does it apply to the concept of uniform distribution shown in the histograms?

The formula for entropy $\mathrm{H}$ given a set of probabilities $p(x_i)$ where $x_i$ are discrete states is:
$$
\mathrm{H} = -\sum_i p(x_i) \log p(x_i)
$$
Applying this to a uniform distribution where each $p(x_i) = \frac{1}{M}$ (with $M$ being the number of states or bins, here 30), the entropy is maximized and given by:
$$
\mathrm{H} = -\sum_{i=1}^M \frac{1}{M} \log \frac{1}{M} = \log M
$$
For the uniform distribution in the histogram (right), since all probabilities $p(x_i)$ are equal, entropy is at its maximum, calculated as $\log(30) \approx 3.40$, close to the displayed value of $3.09$, which indicates a near-maximum entropy state for a nearly uniform distribution.
