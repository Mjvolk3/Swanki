The convexity condition shown in the graph is mathematically expressed as:

$$
f(\lambda a + (1 - \lambda) b) \leq \lambda f(a) + (1 - \lambda) f(b)
$$

where $\lambda$ is a scalar such that $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$, and $a$ and $b$ are points on the $x$ axis.

## What property must the second derivative of a convex function satisfy according to the details surrounding Figure 2.15, and what are some examples?

According to the detailed analysis surrounding Figure 2.15, the second derivative of a convex function must be everywhere positive. This condition helps ensure the function's curvature is always in the upward direction. Examples of convex functions include:

1. $x \ln x$ for $x > 0$ 
2. $x^2$

These functions meet the convexity condition as their second derivatives, $1/x$ and $2$, respectively, are always positive for the specified domains.
