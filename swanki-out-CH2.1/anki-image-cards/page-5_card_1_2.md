The marginal probability of a random variable $X$, denoted as $p(X=x_i)$, in the context of a two-dimensional probability distribution table, is obtained by summing the joint probabilities of $X=x_i$ with all possible values of the other random variable $Y$. Mathematically, the marginal probability is given by:

$$
p\left(X=x_{i}\right) = \sum_{j=1}^{M} p\left(X=x_{i}, Y=y_{j}\right)
$$

where $M$ is the number of possible values $Y$ can take. This operation is referred to as "marginalizing over $Y$".

## Explain the significance of the sum rule of probability depicted in the tableau for a random variable $X$.

The sum rule of probability illustrated in the tableau is essential as it asserts that the total probability for a random variable $X$ across all its possible outcomes equals one ($\sum_{i=1}^{L} p\left(X=x_{i}\right)=1$). This principle ensures the completeness of the probability model and the normalization condition, indicating that the probabilities are well-defined over the entire sample space. In the given context, the sum rule is visually represented by the sum of the marginal probabilities of $X$, which are derived by summing over all corresponding values of another variable $Y$. The sum rule confirms that all possible scenarios for $X$ have been accounted for, reflecting the fundamental axiom of probability theory.
