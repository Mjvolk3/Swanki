The image illustrates the geometric interpretation of a convex function $f(x)$. It shows two points, \(a\) and \(b\), on the x-axis, and a chord (in blue) connecting the points \((a, f(a))\) and \((b, f(b))\). The red curve represents the graph of the function $f(x)$, which by definition of convexity, lies entirely below or on the chord between any two points \(a\) and \(b\). This characteristic ensures that for any \(\lambda\) in \([0,1]\),

$$
f(\lambda a+(1-\lambda) b) \leq \lambda f(a)+(1-\lambda) f(b)
$$

## How does the convexity condition for a function $f(x)$ relate to its second derivative, as illustrated by the graph?

The convexity condition, as illustrated, implies that the second derivative of the function $f(x)$, when it exists, must be non-negative across its domain. The geometric implication shown in the graph is that the function curve never falls below any of its chords, meaning it is consistently "bending upwards". Analytically, if $f''(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$ in its domain, this condition ensures the curve does not exhibit any concavity, hence maintaining its convex nature. For example, functions like \(x^2\) and \( x \ln(x) \) for \(x>0\), which have non-negative second derivatives, clearly exemplify this behavior.
