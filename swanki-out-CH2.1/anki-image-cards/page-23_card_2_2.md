The transformation from \(x\) space to \(y\) space, as illustrated in Figure 2.13, distorts the regular grid pattern into a nonlinear one. This reflects how the Gaussian distribution, initially symmetric and uniformly spread in \(x_1\) and \(x_2\), becomes variably dense and asymmetric in \(y_1\) and \(y_2\). The regions where grid lines concentrate signify higher probabilities, indicating changes in distribution densities and possibly the position of its mode due to the nonlinear transformation. Such transformations frequently involve calculating the determinant of the Jacobian matrix to preserve total probability.

## What principle underlies the equality of probability masses in different variable spaces as shown in Figure 2.13?

According to the principle demonstrated in Figure 2.13, the underlying concept ensuring the equality of probability masses before and after the variable transformation is the conservation of total probability. When variables are changed from \(x\) to \(y\) space, the probability mass contained within any region \( \Delta x \) must equal the probability mass within the corresponding region \( \Delta \mathbf{y} \), as stated in the associated text. This is mathematically supported by the transform formula involving the determinant of the Jacobian matrix \( \left|\frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial \mathbf{y}}\right| \) which adjusts the density function to compensate for the volume change induced by the transformation.
