The leftmost column of Figure 2.13 visually demonstrates the concept of variable transformation by showing two grids: the upper part with a regular grid under the $x_1$, $x_2$ coordinate system, and the lower part under the transformed $y_1$, $y_2$ coordinate system with distorted grid lines. This illustrates how a nonlinear transformation affects the coordinate system, indicating the change in variable domains from $\mathbf{x}$ to $\mathbf{y}$.

## Describe the effects of the nonlinear transformation on the Gaussian distribution as illustrated in Figure 2.13.

In Figure 2.13, the effects of the nonlinear transformation on the Gaussian distribution are depicted in the middle column. The top row shows a symmetrical Gaussian distribution with radial symmetry in the original $x_1-x_2$ plane. After the transformation, shown in the bottom row, the Gaussian distribution becomes more complex and multimodal, indicating a distortion that alters the density and spreads out its probability mass in the transformed $y_1-y_2$ space. This visually represents the impact of the transformation on the distribution's shape and probability density.
