The red curve in Figure 2.9 represents the likelihood function of a Gaussian distribution. The likelihood function, as a function of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$, demonstrates how probable different sets of values for these parameters are, given the observed data set $\{x_n\}$.

## How do the green vertical lines in Figure 2.9 contribute to understanding the likelihood function for the Gaussian distribution?

The green vertical lines in Figure 2.9 connect each data point $\{x_n\}$, marked by grey points along the horizontal axis, to their corresponding values of the probability density function $p(x)$, indicated by blue points on the Gaussian likelihood curve. These lines visually represent how each data point contributes to the calculation of the likelihood function by showing where the observed values $x_n$ fall under the Gaussian curve for given parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$, and thus how they contribute to the overall likelihood of these parameters.
