In Figure 2.5, the scatter plot in the top left quadrant effectively visualizes the joint distribution \( p(X, Y) \). It features 60 data points distributed across nine distinct values of \( X \) and two distinct values of \( Y \). The horizontal columns, separated by red grid lines, represent the values of \( Y \) (1 and 2), while each column within these rows depicts the possible values of \( X \). This distribution allows us to observe how the combinations of \( X \) and \( Y \) occur together within a given dataset.

## Analyze data from the histogram of conditional distribution p(X|Y=1) in Figure 2.5

The histogram in the bottom right quadrant of Figure 2.5 represents the conditional distribution \( p(X \mid Y=1) \). This bar graph estimates how likely different values of \( X \) are given that \( Y=1 \), based solely on the lower row of data points from the joint distribution scatter plot. Each bar's height corresponds to the proportion of data points with \( Y=1 \) for each value of \( X \), demonstrating how \( X \) is distributed under the condition \( Y=1 \).
