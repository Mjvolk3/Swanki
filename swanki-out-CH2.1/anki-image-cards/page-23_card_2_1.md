Figure 2.13 illustrates the concept of variable transformation from a regular Cartesian grid in $(x_1, x_2)$ space to a distorted grid in $(y_1, y_2)$ space. This transformation visually represents a nonlinear mapping, which affects the probability distribution by altering the spacing and curvature of the grid lines, thus impacting the distribution density and the positioning of its mode.

## How does the concept of change of variables apply to the probability distribution in Figure 2.13 and what mathematical principle relates the areas in spaces $x$ and $y$?

In Figure 2.13, the concept of change of variables is applied to transform a probability distribution from one coordinate system to another. This transformation is governed by the mathematical principle that the probability mass in a region $\Delta x$ in the original space must be equal to the probability mass in the corresponding region $\Delta y$ in the transformed space. This is conceptualized through the formula (2.77) in the figure's context, which likely involves the Jacobian determinant to adjust for the difference in area scaling due to the nonlinear transformation.
