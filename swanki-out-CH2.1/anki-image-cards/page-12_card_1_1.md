The red plot represents a uniform distribution over the range $(-1, 1)$. It is constant within this interval and zero elsewhere, with a height adjusted so that the total area under the plot sums to 1, indicating a normalized probability distribution.

## How does the exponential distribution function $p(x \mid \lambda)$ change with varying $\lambda$?

The function $p(x \mid \lambda) = \lambda \exp(-\lambda x)$ for the exponential distribution indicates that as $\lambda$ increases, the decay of the function becomes faster, leading to a steeper drop. For smaller values of $\lambda$, the graph shows a slower decay and a more gradual slope. This behavior highlights the inverse relationship between $\lambda$ and the rate at which the function approaches zero.
