## How does the transformation of the probability density function \( p_x(x) \) as a function of \( y \) using a nonlinear change of variables compare to its mode in \( x \)?

When \( p_x(x) \) is transformed as a function of \( y \) using the nonlinear transformation given by \( g(y) \), the mode of the density shifts. This is illustrated by the green curve \( p_x(g(y)) \) which has its mode at a different location compared to the original density's mode in \( x \) shown by the red curve. This shift results from the properties of the nonlinear transformation used.

## How is the actual transformation of the density over \( y \) represented in Figure 2.12, and how does it relate to the green curve \( p_x(g(y)) \)?

The actual transformation of the density over \( y \), \( p_y(y) \), is represented by the magenta curve in Figure 2.12. This curve is derived by incorporating the correct transformation of variables, which includes the Jacobian determinant of the transformation from \( x \) to \( y \). The magenta curve's mode is shifted relative to the mode of the green curve \( p_x(g(y)) \) because it correctly accounts for the change in the density distribution due to the nonlinear characteristics of the transformation and the scaling effect of the Jacobian determinant.
