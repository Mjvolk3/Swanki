## Explain the impact of using maximum likelihood for estimating the variance of a Gaussian distribution as demonstrated in Figure 2.10.

When using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to determine the variance of a Gaussian distribution from a small sample size, the variance tends to be underestimated. This systematic error arises because the variance is measured relative to the sample mean instead of the true mean. For example, the MLE results from equations (2.57) and (2.58) in a Gaussian setting where $$ \hat\sigma^2_{MLE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \hat\mu_{MLE})^2 $$ and $$ \hat\mu_{MLE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i $$ show this underestimation, as illustrated by the three datasets in Figure 2.10.

## How does the number of data points $N$ influence the bias in maximum likelihood estimation for variance in the Gaussian case?

In the scenario of Gaussian distributions, the bias in variance estimation via maximum likelihood becomes negligible as the number of data points $N$ increases. In the limit as $$ N \rightarrow \infty $$, the maximum likelihood estimate of variance equals the true variance of the underlying distribution. This property highlights that, for sufficiently large datasets in Gaussian settings, the MLE provides accurate and unbiased variance estimates, contrasting with its performance on smaller samples.

## Describe the probabilistic perspective of linear regression and its formulation using Gaussian distributions.

In the probabilistic view of linear regression, the uncertainty about the target variable $t$, given an input $x$, is modeled with a Gaussian distribution. The mean of this distribution is given by the polynomial regression model $$ y(x, \mathbf{w}) $$, where $\mathbf{w}$ represents the polynomial coefficients. The variance is represented by $$ \sigma^2 $$. Mathematically, this is expressed as
$$
p\left(t \mid x, \mathbf{w}, \sigma^{2}\right)=\mathcal{N}\left(t \mid y(x, \mathbf{w}), \sigma^{2}\right)
$$
This formulation articulates how we express our uncertainty in predictions and integrate both the regression curve and the variability of data around this curve.

## How does the number of parameters in a model influence the severity of bias issues in maximum likelihood estimation?

In complex models possessing many parameters, such as neural networks, the issues of bias associated with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) become more pronounced compared to simpler models. This augmentation in bias is fundamentally related to the problem of over-fitting, where the model too closely fits the limited training data, not generalizing well to new data. Thus, in contexts with extensive parameter sets and smaller datasets, MLE may not only provide biased estimates but also lead to performance degradations on unseen data.

## Explain the relationship between maximum likelihood estimation and error minimization in linear regression.

From a probabilistic perspective, the linear regression problem can be seen as an application of maximum likelihood estimation where the target variable $t$, given an input $x$, follows a Gaussian distribution with a mean given by the regression function and a specified variance. The MLE approach essentially minimizes the error between the predicted values and the actual values in the training data, where the 'error' is quantified as the negative log-likelihood of the Gaussian model. This understanding bridges the classical approach of error minimization in regression with probabilistic modeling, highlighting an underlying unity in statistical estimation techniques.
