## What formula can be used to calculate the expectation $\mathbb{E}[f]$ of a function $f$ over a continuous variable?

The formula to calculate the expectation $\mathbb{E}[f]$ for a continuous variable can be represented as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[f]=\int p(x) f(x) \mathrm{d} x
$$

Here, $p(x)$ denotes the probability density of the variable $x$, and $f(x)$ is the function whose expectation is being calculated. The integral is evaluated over the entire range of $x$.

## How can the expectation $\mathbb{E}[f]$ be approximated when $N$ finite points are drawn from the distribution?

When given a finite number $N$ of data points ($x_n$), the expectation $\mathbb{E}[f]$ can be approximated as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[f] \simeq \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} f\left(x_{n}\right)
$$

This approximation becomes exact as $N$ approaches infinity ($N \rightarrow \infty$). Each $x_n$ is a realization from the probability distribution or density $p(x)$.

## What notation and calculation method are used for the expectation $\mathbb{E}_{x}[f(x, y)]$ with respect to the distribution of $x$?

The notation $\mathbb{E}_{x}[f(x, y)]$ is used to denote the expectation of a function $f(x, y)$ with respect to the distribution of $x$, and can be either a sum or integral depending on whether $x$ is discrete or continuous:

$$
\mathbb{E}_{x}[f(x, y)]
$$

Here, $\mathbb{E}_{x}[f(x, y)]$ will be a function of the other variable $y$, depending on the nature of $f$ and the dependency of $x$ and $y$. This reflects averaging over the values of $x$ while treating $y$ as a constant.

## How is the variance $\operatorname{var}[f]$ of a function $f(x)$ defined and calculated?

The variance $\operatorname{var}[f]$ of a function $f(x)$ is defined and calculated as:

$$
\operatorname{var}[f]=\mathbb{E}\left[(f(x)-\mathbb{E}[f(x)])^{2}\right]
$$

which can also be expressed by the formula:

$$
\operatorname{var}[f]=\mathbb{E}\left[f(x)^{2}\right]-\mathbb{E}[f(x)]^{2}
$$

This variance measures how much $f(x)$ varies around its mean $\mathbb{E}[f(x)]$, thus offering a quantitative assessment of dispersion or spread.

## How can you define and calculate the covariance between two random variables $x$ and $y$?

Covariance between two random variables $x$ and $y$, denoted as $\operatorname{cov}[x, y]$, is defined and calculated by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{cov}[x, y] &= \mathbb{E}_{x, y}[\{x-\mathbb{E}[x]\}\{y-\mathbb{E}[y]\}] \\
&= \mathbb{E}_{x, y}[x y]-\mathbb{E}[x] \mathbb{E}[y]
\end{aligned}
$$

Covariance measures the extent to which $x$ and $y$ vary together. A positive covariance indicates that $x$ and $y$ tend to increase or decrease together, whereas a negative covariance indicates that one increases when the other decreases.
