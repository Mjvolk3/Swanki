## Explain why $-\ln x$ is considered a strictly convex function.

$-\ln x$ is considered strictly convex because its second derivative, $\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(-\ln x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$, is positive for all $x > 0$. In convex analysis, a function is termed strictly convex if its second derivative is positive over the interval of interest, which implies that the curve lies above any secant line joining two points on the graph, and equality only holds at those two points.

## What does the normalization condition $\int q(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}=1$ signify in the context of probability distributions?

The normalization condition $\int q(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} = 1$ ensures that $q(\mathbf{x})$ qualifies as a probability distribution. It represents the total probability distributed across all possible outcomes and must sum to one. This is a fundamental property of any probability distribution, confirming that it correctly assigns a measure to the set of all possible outcomes in a sample space.

## Derive the expression for Kullback-Leibler divergence approximation using a finite sample set.

Given a target distribution $p(\mathbf{x})$ and an approximating distribution $q(\mathbf{x} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta})$, the Kullback-Leibler divergence can be approximated as:

$$
\mathrm{KL}(p \| q) \simeq \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{-\ln q\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}\right)+\ln p\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}\right)\right\}
$$

Here, $N$ is the number of observed data points, $\mathbf{x}_{n}$, drawn from $p(\mathbf{x})$. This approximation arises from the empirical average of the log ratio of the probabilities according to $p$ and $q$, with the dependence on $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ prominent in the first term representing the log likelihood of the observed data under $q$.

## How does the relationship $\mathrm{H}[\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}]=\mathrm{H}[\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{x}]+\mathrm{H}[\mathbf{x}]$ encapsulate the properties of entropy in information theory?

This relationship indicates that the total entropy $\mathrm{H}[\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}]$, representing the uncertainty in joint random variables $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, is the sum of the entropy $\mathrm{H}[\mathbf{x}]$ (uncertainty of $\mathbf{x}$ alone) and the conditional entropy $\mathrm{H}[\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{x}]$ (uncertainty of $\mathbf{y}$ given $\mathbf{x}$ has occurred). This aligns with the fundamental principle that joint entropy can be decomposed into the sum of marginal entropy and conditional entropy, bridging marginal and conditional distributions in a quantifiable expression of uncertainty.

## Analyze the equation $\mathrm{H}[\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{x}]=-\iint p(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{x}) \ln p(\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{y} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}$ in terms of its components and implications.

The equation defines the conditional entropy of $\mathbf{y}$ given $\mathbf{x}$. Conditional entropy quantifies the expected amount of information required to describe $\mathbf{y}$ once $\mathbf{x}$ is known. Each component $p(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{x})$ signifies the joint probability, and $\ln p(\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{x})$ is the natural logarithm of the conditional probability of $\mathbf{y}$ given $\mathbf{x}$. The integral calculates the expected value of this logarithmic measure across the joint distribution, essentially measuring the average surprise or uncertainty in $\mathbf{y}$ after $\mathbf{x}$ is observed.
