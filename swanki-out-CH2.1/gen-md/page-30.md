## What characterizes a function as convex according to the provided description and equations?

A function $f(x)$ is characterized as convex if for any two points \(a\) and \(b\), and for any \(\lambda \in [0, 1]\), the inequality $$f(\lambda a + (1-\lambda) b) \leq \lambda f(a) + (1-\lambda) f(b)$$ holds. This condition states that the line segment (chord) between any two points on the function lies above or on the graph of the function.

## What is meant by a function being "strictly convex"?

A function is termed strictly convex if the inequality $$f(\lambda a + (1-\lambda) b) < \lambda f(a) + (1-\lambda) f(b)$$ is true for all \(\lambda \in (0, 1)\) and for all distinct points \(a\) and \(b\). This indicates that the chord connecting any two points on the function's graph lies strictly above the graph, except at the endpoints \(a\) and \(b\).

## Explain Jensen's inequality as it applies to a convex function $f(x)$.

Jensen's inequality states that for a convex function $f(x)$, if $\{\lambda_i\}$ are non-negative real numbers that sum to 1, and $\{x_i\}$ are any points, then $$f\left(\sum_{i=1}^M \lambda_i x_i\right) \leq \sum_{i=1}^M \lambda_i f(x_i)$$ holds. This inequality suggests that the value of the function at a weighted average is less than or equal to the weighted average of the function values at those points.

## How does Jensen's inequality extend to expectations for random variables?

Jensen's inequality extended to expectations states that for a convex function $f(x)$, $$f(\mathbb{E}[x]) \leq \mathbb{E}[f(x)]$$ where $\mathbb{E}[x]$ represents the expected value of the random variable $x$. This formulation shows that the function value at the expectation of $x$ is less than or equal to the expectation of the function values of $x$.

## Apply Jensen's inequality to derive the non-negativity of Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Given the convex function \( -\ln x \) and using Jensen's inequality in the form $$f\left(\int \mathbf{x} p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}\right) \leq \int f(\mathbf{x}) p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}$$ applied to Kullback-Leibler divergence leads to $$\mathrm{KL}(p \| q) = -\int p(\mathbf{x}) \ln \left\{\frac{q(\mathbf{x})}{p(\mathbf{x})}\right\} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \geq -\ln \int q(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} = 0.$$ This shows that the KL divergence is always non-negative due to the convexity of the negative logarithm function.
