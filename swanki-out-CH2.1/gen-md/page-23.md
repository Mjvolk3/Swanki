## What is the motivation behind using the modulus in the change of variables formula in probability theory?

The modulus in the change of variables formula in probability theory is used to ensure that the density remains nonnegative. This is crucial because probability densities, by definition, must not be negative as they represent probabilities.

## How does the transformation formula from $\mathbf{x}$ to $\mathbf{y}$ define $y_1$ and $y_2$?

The transformation from $\mathbf{x}$ to $\mathbf{y}$ is defined as:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& y_{1}=x_{1}+\tanh \left(5 x_{1}\right) \\
& y_{2}=x_{2}+\tanh \left(5 x_{2}\right)+\frac{x_{1}^{3}}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$
This transformation incorporates both linear and non-linear components, combining straightforward shifts and scaling with non-linear functions like the hyperbolic tangent and a cubic term.

## Describe the effect of the transformation shown in Figure 2.13 on a Gaussian distribution using the specified change of variables.

Figure 2.13 demonstrates the effect of a non-linear transformation on a Gaussian distribution through the transformation equations:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& y_{1}=x_{1}+\tanh \left(5 x_{1}\right) \\
& y_{2}=x_{2}+\tanh \left(5 x_{2}\right)+\frac{x_{1}^{3}}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$
These changes lead to distortions in the shape and spread of the Gaussian distribution, as the mapping introduces skewness and changes in variance due to the non-linear and cubic components of the transformation.

## Explain the principle of equal probability mass in the context of changing variables in probability distributions.

The principle of equal probability mass implies that when transforming variables within a probability distribution, the total probability mass in any region of the original variable space ($\Delta x$) is preserved in the transformed variable space ($\Delta \mathbf{y}$). This principle is foundational for the correct application of change of variables in probability distributions, ensuring that the total probability across the distribution remains consistent.

## How would you apply the concept of change of variables to a simple Gaussian distribution using the transformation given?

To apply the change of variables concept to a Gaussian distribution with the transformation:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& y_{1}=x_{1}+\tanh \left(5 x_{1}\right) \\
& y_{2}=x_{2}+\tanh \left(5 x_{2}\right)+\frac{x_{1}^{3}}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$
You would compute the Jacobian of the transformation to find the new density function. The Jacobian matrix is determined by the derivatives of the transformation functions with respect to each variable, which modifies the original Gaussian density accordingly. This application demonstrates how a Gaussian distribution's density reacts under complex variable mappings.
