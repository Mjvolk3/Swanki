## How does Bayes' theorem calculate the probability of having cancer given a positive test result? 

To determine the probability of having cancer given a positive test result, Bayes' theorem is applied as follows:

$$
p(C=1 \mid T=1) = \frac{p(T=1 \mid C=1) p(C=1)}{p(T=1)}
$$

Here,
- $p(C=1 \mid T=1)$ is the posterior probability of having cancer given a positive test,
- $p(T=1 \mid C=1)$ is the likelihood of testing positive if the person has cancer,
- $p(C=1)$ is the prior probability of having cancer,
- $p(T=1)$ is the probability of testing positive.

In the example given, the values are calculated as follows:

$$
p(C=1 \mid T=1) = \frac{90}{100} \times \frac{1}{100} \times \frac{10,000}{387} = \frac{90}{387} \simeq 0.23
$$

Thus, there is approximately a 23% probability of actually having cancer given a positive test result.

## What is the probability of not having cancer given a positive test result?

Given the posterior probability of having cancer, the probability of not having cancer given a positive test result can be found by subtracting the posterior probability from 1:

$$
p(C=0 \mid T=1) = 1 - p(C=1 \mid T=1)
$$

Using the values from the prior question:
$$
p(C=0 \mid T=1) = 1 - \frac{90}{387} = \frac{297}{387} \simeq 0.77
$$

So, there is approximately a 77% chance that the person does not have cancer despite the positive test.

## Define and differentiate between prior and posterior probabilities in the context of Bayesian statistics.

In Bayesian statistics:
- **Prior probability**, denoted as $p(C)$, is the probability of an event before any new evidence is considered. It reflects the initial belief before any additional information is provided.

$$
p(C) = 1\% \quad (\text{prior probability of cancer})
$$

- **Posterior probability**, denoted as $p(C \mid T)$, is the probability of an event given the new evidence. It is calculated using Bayes' theorem to update the prior belief based on new information.

$$
p(C \mid T) = 23\% \quad (\text{posterior probability of cancer given a positive test})
$$

The prior probability in this case was 1% for cancer, which increases to a posterior probability of 23% upon obtaining the positive test result, showing an adaptation based on new, specific information.

## What is the significance of understanding the difference between prior and posterior probabilities in medical contexts?

Understanding the distinction between prior and posterior probabilities is crucial in medical contexts as it helps in:
- Interpreting diagnostic test results correctly,
- Adjusting the likelihood of health conditions based on specific individual tests,
- Making informed decisions about further diagnostic actions or treatments.

It illustrates how Bayesian reasoning can yield very different probabilities from intuitive expectations, especially in cases like cancer screening, where despite a 'reasonable' test accuracy, the actual probability of having cancer after a positive test might still be low (23%) due to the initial low incidence rate (1%).

## Explain the concept of independence in probability and cite an example using cancer screening.

Two events or variables are considered independent in probability if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other. This is mathematically expressed as the factorization of their joint distribution:

$$
p(X, Y) = p(X)p(Y)
$$

From this, it follows that:

$$
p(Y \mid X) = p(Y)
$$

In a cancer screening context, if testing positive for cancer ($T$) is independent of actually having cancer ($C$), then:

$$
p(T \mid C) = p(T)
$$

and by Bayes' theorem:

$$
p(C \mid T) = p(C)
$$

This would imply that the test is ineffective as the result does not provide any information about the condition (i.e., having cancer).
