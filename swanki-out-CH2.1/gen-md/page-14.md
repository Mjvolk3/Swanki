## How does the covariance matrix between two vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ look?
The covariance matrix between two vectors, $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, is defined by: 
$$
\operatorname{cov}[\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}] = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}}\left[\{\mathbf{x}-\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}]\}\left\{\mathbf{y}^{\mathrm{T}}-\mathbb{E}\left[\mathbf{y}^{\mathrm{T}}\right]\right\}\right] 
= \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}}\left[\mathbf{x} \mathbf{y}^{\mathrm{T}}\right]-\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}] \mathbb{E}\left[\mathbf{y}^{\mathrm{T}}\right]
$$
This matrix measures the linear dependence between the components of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$.

## How is the covariance of a single vector $\mathbf{x}$ with itself represented and calculated?
The covariance of a vector $\mathbf{x}$ with itself, written as $\operatorname{cov}[\mathbf{x}]$, simplifies to:
$$
\operatorname{cov}[\mathbf{x}] \equiv \operatorname{cov}[\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}]
$$
This is effectively the covariance matrix of the vector with itself, capturing the variances and covariances of the components of $\mathbf{x}$.

## What is the significance of the Gaussian distribution described by $\mathcal{N}\left(x \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right)$, and how is it defined mathematically?
The Gaussian, or normal, distribution plays a critical role in the statistical analysis of continuous variables. It is mathematically defined as:
$$
\mathcal{N}\left(x \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right) = \frac{1}{\left(2 \pi \sigma^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}} \exp \left\{-\frac{1}{2 \sigma^{2}}(x-\mu)^{2}\right\}
$$
This expression maps any real value $x$ to a probability, governed by the mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ of the distribution.

## What is the rationale behind defining the variance inversely as precision in the context of Gaussian distributions?
In Gaussian distributions, the precision, denoted as $\beta$, is defined as the reciprocal of the variance:
$$
\beta = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}
$$
This measure reflects how concentrated the distribution is around the mean. A higher precision (lower variance) implies a tighter, more focused distribution about the mean $\mu$, emphasizing the role of variance in controlling the spread of the distribution.

## What mathematical property of the Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}\left(x \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right)$ assures its positivity and relevance in probability and statistics?
The Gaussian distribution is always positive, a property crucial for any probability density function, which is described by the inequality:
$$
\mathcal{N}\left(x \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right) > 0
$$
This characteristic ensures that the Gaussian function is a valid probability density function across the real number line, contributing to its extensive use in statistical modeling and inference.
