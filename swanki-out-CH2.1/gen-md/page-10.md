## Define the concept of a probability density for a continuous variable.

Probability density $p(x)$ for a continuous variable $x$ is defined such that the instantaneous probability of $x$ falling within an infinitesimally small interval around $x$ is given by $p(x) \delta x$, where $\delta x \rightarrow 0$.

## Explain how the probability that a continuous variable $x$ lies within an interval $(a, b)$ is calculated.

The probability that $x$ lies within the interval $(a, b)$ is computed as the integral of the probability density $p(x)$ over the interval, represented as:

$$
p(x \in(a, b))=\int_{a}^{b} p(x) \mathrm{d} x
$$

This integral sums the probability densities over the range from $a$ to $b$, thereby calculating the total probability of $x$ falling within this range.

## What conditions must the probability density function $p(x)$ satisfy?

The probability density function $p(x)$ must satisfy two primary conditions:
1. Non-negativity: $p(x) \geqslant 0$ for all $x$.
2. Normalization: The total area under the probability density curve must equal 1, represented by the integral:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \mathrm{d} x=1
$$

These conditions ensure that $p(x)$ is a proper representation of probabilities over the real axis.

## Define the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) $P(z)$ for a continuous variable.

The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), $P(z)$, for a continuous variable $x$ is defined by the integral of the probability density function $p(x)$ from negative infinity to $z$, as:

$$
P(z)=\int_{-\infty}^{z} p(x) \mathrm{d} x
$$

The CDF $P(z)$ represents the probability that the variable $x$ assumes a value less than or equal to $z$.

## Discuss the extension of probability concepts from discrete to continuous variables, focusing on the challenges of defining probabilities in continuous settings.

In a continuous setting, unlike discrete settings, the probability of observing any specific exact value is zero because of the infinite possibilities within any range. This necessitates the concept of a probability density, which allows for the determination of probabilities over intervals, instead of discrete points, to effectively manage and quantify uncertainty in continuous variables.

This transition involves understanding and utilizing differential calculus and integrals to define and compute probability measures in continuous domains.
