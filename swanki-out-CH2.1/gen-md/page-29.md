## Derive the functional form of $p(x)$ using the calculus of variations and given constraints
Given the constraints in a calculus of variations problem, the functional form of $p(x)$ maximizing entropy without explicitly requiring non-negativity is found to be $$ p(x)=\exp \left\{-1+\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2} x+\lambda_{3}(x-\mu)^{2}\right\}.$$ Determine and discuss the implications of the resulting form after implicating given Lagrange multipliers.

The resulting distribution, given by $$p(x)=\frac{1}{\left(2 \pi \sigma^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}} \exp \left\{-\frac{(x-\mu)^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}}\right\},$$ will be identified as the Gaussian distribution. It highlights that the maximum entropy under the constraints leads to a Gaussian shape, establishing a critical connection between entropy maximization and Gaussian distributions in probabilistic models. Notably, the problem stipulates entropy maximization without the need for a non-negativity constraint, which aligns with the inherent properties of the exponential function ensuring non-negativity.

## Explain how the differential entropy of the Gaussian distribution is calculated
Given the Gaussian distribution $$ p(x)=\frac{1}{\left(2 \pi \sigma^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}} \exp \left\{-\frac{(x-\mu)^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}}\right\},$$ calculate and interpret the expression for its differential entropy.

The differential entropy $H[x]$ for a Gaussian distribution is derived as $$ \mathrm{H}[x]=\frac{1}{2}\left\{1+\ln \left(2 \pi \sigma^{2}\right)\right\}. $$ This calculation reflects that entropy increases with the spread of the distribution, measured by $\sigma^2$. It also illustrates that differential entropy, unlike its discrete counterpart, can be negative, emphasizing that the behavior of continuous entropy metrics can differ fundamentally from those for discrete variables.

## Define and interpret the Kullback-Leibler divergence in information theory
The Kullback-Leibler divergence, or KL divergence, quantifies the extra information needed when an approximate distribution $q(\mathbf{x})$ is used instead of the true distribution $p(\mathbf{x})$. Formally, it is given by $$ \mathrm{KL}(p \| q) =-\int p(\mathbf{x}) \ln \left\{\frac{q(\mathbf{x})}{p(\mathbf{x})}\right\} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}.$$

This metric is crucial in assessing the "distance" or divergence between two probability distributions, emphasizing that it is not symmetric. KL divergence is extensively used in statistical inference and machine learning to measure how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution.

## Demonstrate the non-negativity of the Kullback-Leibler divergence using convexity
Illustrate why the Kullback-Leibler divergence $$ \mathrm{KL}(p \| q) $$ always yields non-negative values by leveraging the property of convex functions.

The proof utilizes the Jensen's Inequality, which is applicable due to the convex nature of the $-\log(x)$ function. Essentially, $$ \mathrm{KL}(p \| q) \geqslant 0 $$ holds, with equality if and only if $p(\mathbf{x}) = q(\mathbf{x})$. This demonstrates the intrinsic mathematical properties governing the behavior of KL divergence and further solidifies its foundational role in assessing the effectiveness of statistical estimations and machine learning predictions.

## Discuss the relation between the spread of Gaussian distribution and its differential entropy
Explain the relationship between the spread (variance) of a Gaussian distribution and its differential entropy, noting the condition under which the entropy can be negative.

The broader the Gaussian distribution, as indicated by an increase in $\sigma^2$, the greater its differential entropy. This relationship is quantified by $$ \mathrm{H}[x]=\frac{1}{2}\left\{1+\ln \left(2 \pi \sigma^{2}\right)\right\}. $$ Importantly, if $\sigma^2 < 1/(2 \pi e)$, then the differential entropy $H[x]$ becomes negative. This highlights unique properties of continuous entropy measures compared to discrete entropy, where entropy values are inherently non-negative.
