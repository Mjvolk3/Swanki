## How is the Gaussian distribution normalized?

The Gaussian distribution is normalized, indicated by the integral across the entire real line equating to unity:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathcal{N}\left(x \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right) \mathrm{d} x=1
$$

This integral confirms the property that the total probability under the Gaussian curve sums to $1$, a fundamental requirement for it to be a probability density function.

## What does the mean of a Gaussian distribution represent?

The mean of a Gaussian distribution, denoted as $\mu$, is the expected value of $x$ under this distribution. Mathematically, it is given by:

$$
\mathbb{E}[x]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathcal{N}\left(x \mid \mu, \sigma^{2}\right) x \mathrm{~d} x=\mu
$$

Here, $\mathbb{E}[x]$ is the first-order moment, reflecting the average or central tendency where the data points are most likely to cluster around.

## How is the variance of a Gaussian distribution computed?

The variance of a Gaussian distribution is given by the formula:

$$
\operatorname{var}[x]=\mathbb{E}\left[x^{2}\right]-\mathbb{E}[x]^{2}=\sigma^{2}
$$

Here, $\operatorname{var}[x]$ defines the spread of the distribution around the mean, $\mu$. The variance, $\sigma^2$, represents the average of the squared differences from the Mean, providing a measure of how much the values of $x$ spread out from the mean.

## Define the likelihood function in the context of Gaussian density estimation from a dataset.

The likelihood function for Gaussian density estimation when the observations $\mathbf{x}=(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{N})$ are assumed to be independently drawn from a Gaussian distribution is essential in determining the unknown parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^{2}$. This function reflects how probable it is to obtain the observed data under different parameterizations of the Gaussian model.

Understanding this concept is critical in statistics and helps in fitting statistical models to data, under the assumption of normality.

## What does independence and identical distribution (i.i.d.) imply in the context of statistical data analysis?

In statistical data analysis, assuming that data points are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) means that each data point is drawn from the same probability distribution and that each draw is independent of others. This assumption simplifies the analysis significantly, as the joint probability of a dataset can then be expressed as the product of individual probabilities:

$$
p(\mathbf{x}) = p(x_1) \times p(x_2) \times \ldots \times p(x_N)
$$

Understanding this assumption is fundamental when constructing models based on data since it influences the formulation of likelihood functions and other statistical measures.
