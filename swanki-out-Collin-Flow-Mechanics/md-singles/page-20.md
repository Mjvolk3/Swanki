mounted on the Mars 2020 capsule. Data from that lander are currently being analyzed. The data from MEDLI (Bose et al. 2014) provided the first flight data for in-depth response of the TPS temperature. Insight into the location of the boundary layer transition during Mars entry was achieved from the change in slope in the time evolution of the temperature profiles (Bose et al. 2014). Detailed analysis of the data shows that refinement of current models of boundary layer transition estimates and in-depth material response are needed.

The MEDLI data are still being used intensively to provide insight into the physics during atmospheric entry and to address the inherent uncertainty of existing models (Mahzari et al. 2015). The heatshield of MSL was built with PICA tiles with room-temperature-vulcanizing (RTV)-silicon-filled gaps in between them. Differential recession between the RTV and PICA (see Figure 7) results in discontinuities of the surface that may play a large role in the transition of the boundary layer from laminar to turbulent flows. This area of research has not been addressed to the extent necessary to provide an educated input to risk analysis.

In the next decade, several missions are planned and are being coordinated to bring back samples from Mars. Some of these missions will have instrumented heatshields that will enable refinement of aerothermal models of the Mars atmosphere as well as data within the porous heatshields. The efforts in the coming decade will culminate with the Mars sample return mission, which will bring back and release the Earth entry vehicle with an instrumented heatshield. The Earth entry vehicle is scheduled to return to Earth in 2031.

SUMMARY POINTS
}

1. Reviewing the scientific advancements and technological achievements of the 1960s and 1970s in support of space exploration leaves one in admiration of the scientists of that period. A large portion of advancements made during that period remain relevant and are in current practice. Their reports show that they understood the limitation of their methods given the available technology at the time.

2. Fast progress is observed in direct numerical simulations (DNS) of fully coupled free-stream/porous wall flows for incompressible flows that take advantage of modern
