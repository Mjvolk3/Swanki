## Explain how the data from MEDLI contributed to the understanding of the TPS temperature response during Mars entry.

The Mars Science Laboratory Instrument (MEDLI) data provided the first flight data for in-depth response of the thermal protection system (TPS) temperature. This data gave insight into the boundary layer transition during Mars entry.

## What are the materials used in the heatshield of the MSL, and why is the gap filling significant?

The MSL heatshield was built with Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) tiles and room-temperature-vulcanizing (RTV) silicone-filled gaps. The differential recession between RTV and PICA results in surface discontinuities which influence the boundary layer's transition from laminar to turbulent flows.

## How is differential recession between RTV and PICA visually represented in the paper?

In the paper, differential recession is illustrated in Figure 7, showing predicted surface temperature and differential recession at 70 seconds after Mars Science Laboratory's atmospheric entry interface.

## Describe the significance of understanding the location of the boundary layer transition during Mars entry.

The location of the boundary layer transition is significant as it affects thermal loads and aerodynamic forces on the spacecraft. Understanding this transition can refine models and improve risk analysis for future missions.

## What are the future missions' goals regarding the heatshields and aerothermal models?

Future missions aim to have instrumented heatshields on returning samples, which will enable the refinement of aerothermal models of the Mars atmosphere and data within porous heatshields, ultimately aiding in better understanding and risk assessment for the Mars sample return mission scheduled for 2031.
