## Describe the approach for determining the heat capacity and heat of pyrolysis of materials and name a reference for this method.

The heat capacity and heat of pyrolysis of materials are determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This method measures the heat flow required to increase the temperature of a sample and derives these thermal properties.

## What is Knudsen regime permeability and why is it of particular interest to TPS applications?

Knudsen regime permeability is relevant when the material pore scale is of the same order as the mean free path of the permeating gases. It is of particular interest to TPS (Thermal Protection System) applications because such conditions are typical in these materials.

## What happens to permeability as the Knudsen number increases, and what is observed in the transition regime?

As the Knudsen number increases, permeability decreases but reaches a minimum in the transition regime.

The Knudsen number ($K_n$) is defined as:
$$
K_n = \frac{\lambda}{L}
$$
where $\lambda$ is the mean free path of the molecules and $L$ is the characteristic length scale of the system.

## How is the DSMC method utilized in the context of porous materials, and at what Knudsen number regime does it become computationally intensive?

The DSMC (Direct Simulation Monte Carlo) method is used with $\mu$-CT (micro computed tomography) rendering of porous materials. It is computationally intensive at low Knudsen numbers but has proven accurate in comparison with experimental data for these conditions.

## What experimental setup is used to determine the intrinsic $\underline{\mathbf{K}}_{0}$ permeability and the Knudsen correction factor $\underline{\mathbf{b}}$?

The intrinsic $\underline{\mathbf{K}}_{0}$ permeability and the Knudsen correction factor $\underline{\mathbf{b}}$ can be determined from differential pressure measurements across porous samples at increasing mass flows and average pressure. This setup allows for direct measurement of these properties under controlled conditions.
