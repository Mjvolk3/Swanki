## Explain the significance of the bondline temperature in the design of the Thermal Protection System (TPS).

The bondline temperature is a design driver when sizing the thickness of the TPS. This temperature determines how thick the TPS needs to be to protect the underlying structure from excessive heat.

## What are the major contributors to thermal diffusivity in high-porosity insulators used in lightweight ablators?

The effective thermal diffusivity in high-porosity insulators is the result of combined solid conduction, gas conduction, and radiative transfer. These processes are closely coupled to the forced convection caused by pressure gradients due to pyrolysis gases.

## How do Knudsen effects influence thermal transport at the gas-solid interface in lightweight ablators?

Knudsen effects become prominent at low pressures and high temperatures, altering transport at the gas-solid interface. This effect often necessitates correcting the gas thermal conductivity based on the Knudsen number.

## What are some common experimental methods used to determine the effective thermal properties of ablators?

Some standard methods to determine the effective thermal properties of ablators include laser flash analysis, guarded hot plate, and comparative-longitudinal heat flow techniques. These methods, however, involve substantial approximations to actual flight conditions.

## Discuss theoretical approaches used to estimate the effective thermal conductivity of porous materials.

Theoretical approaches such as homogenization and volume averaging are used to estimate the effective conductivity of porous materials. Notable works in this area include those by Hornung (1997), Whitaker (1999), Leroy et al. (2013), and Quintard (2015).
