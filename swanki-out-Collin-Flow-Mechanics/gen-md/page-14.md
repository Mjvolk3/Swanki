## Using the driving forces to estimate bulk diffusion fluxes involves what key variables and equations?

The bulk diffusion fluxes of mass $\mathcal{F}$ and energy $\mathcal{Q}_i$ are estimated using the driving forces and considering the porosity, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}$, and tortuosity, $\eta$, of the medium. The equations are:

$$
\mathcal{F}=\frac{\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}}{\eta} \mathcal{F}^{*}
$$

and

$$
\mathcal{Q}_{i}=\frac{\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}}{\eta} \mathcal{Q}_{i}^{*}
$$

Here, $\eta$ is the material tortuosity factor.

## Define the material tortuosity factor $\eta$ in the context of bulk diffusion in porous media.

The material tortuosity factor $\eta$ represents the complexity of the pathways that fluid must navigate through a porous medium. In the context of bulk diffusion, $\eta$ modifies the intrinsic diffusion flux $\mathcal{F}^{*}$ and energy flux $\mathcal{Q}^{*}$ as follows:

$$
\mathcal{F}=\frac{\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}}{\eta} \mathcal{F}^{*}
$$

and

$$
\mathcal{Q}_{i}=\frac{\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}}{\eta} \mathcal{Q}_{i}^{*}
$$

where $\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}$ is the porosity.

## Explain the importance of the multipoint flux approximation in thermal transport modeling.

The multipoint flux approximation (MPFA) is crucial in thermal transport modeling because it ensures the continuity of temperature and heat flux at the surface of each voxel. This method is both efficient and accurate, as discussed in various studies (Semeraro et al. 2021, Aavatsmark 2002).

## What are $\mu$-CT images used for in the context of ablator microstructure analysis?

$\mu$-CT (X-ray computed microtomography) images are used to capture the microstructure of ablators, providing detailed quantitative information on properties such as bulk porosity, fiber orientation, and anisotropic pore size. These images offer a 3D grid of stacked gray images where voxel intensity relates to local material X-ray absorption.

## How do morphological and transport properties inform the closure model formulations of ablators?

Morphological and transport properties such as volume fraction, material anisotropy, surface area, and porosity are critical for closure model formulations. These properties, often obtained through $\mu$-CT imaging and DNS, help create accurate models of multiphysics processes within ablators, as discussed in Section 3.4.

## Discuss the role of image segmentation in analyzing $\mu$-CT images of strongly anisotropic materials.

Image segmentation is essential for determining the phases and fiber orientation in $\mu$-CT images of anisotropic materials. Accurate segmentation methods help calculate effective properties and address challenges such as segmentation errors, which impact the calculated properties' uncertainty (Krygier et al. 2021).
