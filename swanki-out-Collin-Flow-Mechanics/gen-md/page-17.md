## Explain how values at high temperatures can be estimated for permeability corrections.

Values at high temperatures are estimated by scaling the effective permeability with gas viscosity, temperature, and molar mass to the values at room temperature, and corrections can be made to account for variability in material density.

## Describe the method used for inferring the tortuosity factors of fibrous ablators.

Tortuosity factors of fibrous ablators are inferred using image-based simulations with both simplified geometries and 3D microtomography images. The factor is computed at all Knudsen regimes (from continuum to rarefied) using Brownian motion diffusion and methods like random walk particle methods, DSMC, and finite-volume solutions of the diffusion equation.

## What techniques are conventionally used to measure pyrolysis decomposition?

Conventional measurements of pyrolysis decomposition use thermogravimetric analysis and gas analysis techniques such as gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. These techniques provide material density variation as a function of time and temperature and quantification of gaseous products.

## Discuss the dependency of molar yields from the thermal decomposition of phenolic resin SC-1008 as found by Bessire & Minton (2017).

Bessire & Minton (2017) demonstrated that molar yields from the thermal decomposition of the phenolic resin SC-1008, used in most carbon/phenolic ablators, are dependent on the heat rate. This suggests that pyrolysis of PICA is a nonequilibrium process.

## Compare old models with new finite-rate ablation models for the carbon-air system in terms of their predictions.

Old models (e.g., Park 1976, Zhluktov & Abe 1999) tend to favor the formation of $\mathrm{CO}_2$ over $\mathrm{CO}$, which affects the temperature and recession. New finite-rate ablation models tend to favor $\mathrm{CO}$ formation, leading to higher temperatures and lower recession. These newer models show better agreement with experimental data (Candler 2019).

## How do image-based simulations contribute to modeling the surface roughness during ablation? Provide an example of their application.

Image-based simulations model surface roughness during ablation by capturing differences in ablation depth, differential reaction of matrix and fibers, and competing diffusion-reaction processes in rate-limited regimes. First developed for carbon/carbon ablators, these simulations are verified against analytical solutions and extended to porous carbon preforms.
