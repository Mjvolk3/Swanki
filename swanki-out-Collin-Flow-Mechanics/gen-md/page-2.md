## Which theory led to the development of ablative heatshields, and what are they used for?

The blunt body theory, introduced by H. Julian Allen, led to the development of ablative heatshields. They are used to protect spacecraft from extreme aerodynamic heating during atmospheric entry.

## Describe the primary function of NASA's phenolic impregnated carbon ablator (PICA).

NASAâ€™s phenolic impregnated carbon ablator (PICA) functions by providing superior insulation performance, reducing through-thickness heat transfer, and producing endothermic chemical processes that blow cool gases through the material into the boundary layer.

### 
## What are the components of PICA, and what object used it for its heatshield while returning samples?

PICA is composed of a rigid carbon fiber preform (FiberForm) infused with a cross-linked phenolic resin (SC-1008). The Stardust sample return capsule used PICA for its heatshield while returning samples from the Wild 2 comet.

### 
## What important parameters drive material selection for heatshields during atmospheric entry system design?

Maximum heat flux $\dot{q}_{\max }$, maximum surface-averaged heat flux $\bar{q}_{\text{max}}$, and the time-integrated heat input (heat load) $Q$ are essential parameters.
