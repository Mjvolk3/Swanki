## What is the extended momentum equation for compressible flow in the fluid phase with a moving boundary?

Here is the extended momentum equation:

$$
\left(\rho^{\mathrm{f}} \mathbf{u}^{\mathrm{f}}\right)_{, t}+\nabla_{\mathcal{E}} \cdot\left(\rho^{\mathrm{f}} \mathbf{u}^{\mathrm{f}} \otimes \mathbf{u}^{\mathrm{f}}\right)=\nabla_{\underline{E}} \cdot\left(-p^{\mathrm{f}} \underline{\mathrm{I}}+\underline{\boldsymbol{\tau}}^{\mathrm{f}}\right)+\mathbf{F}^{\Sigma_{\mathrm{f}}}
$$

## Given the momentum equation for compressible flow in the fluid phase with moving boundaries, what is the term $\mathbf{F}^{\Sigma_{\mathrm{f}}}$?

$$
\mathbf{F}^{\Sigma_{\mathrm{f}}}=\left(\rho_{\mathrm{f}} \mathbf{u}_{\mathrm{f}} \otimes \mathbf{w}-\rho_{\mathrm{f}} \mathbf{u}_{\mathrm{f}} \otimes \mathbf{u}_{\mathrm{f}}-p_{\mathrm{f}} \underline{I}+\underline{\boldsymbol{\tau}}_{\mathrm{f}}\right) \cdot \boldsymbol{n}^{\mathrm{f}} \delta\left(\boldsymbol{\xi}-\xi^{\Sigma_{\mathrm{f}}}\right)
$$

This term corresponds to the boundary forces appearing in the governing equations.

## How do you extend a governing equation from $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{f}}^{3}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ by using the phase-mask?

To extend a governing equation from $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{f}}^{3}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, you multiply the equation by the phase-mask of the fluid phase, $(\gamma^{\mathrm{f}})^3$. Using the differentiation by parts and the properties of the gradients of the phase-mask function, you can rearrange the terms to define all dependent variables in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.

## What is Volume Averaging Method (VAM), and how does it define superficial averaged quantities?

Volume Averaging Method (VAM) defines superficial averaged quantities of interest by averaging the variables over an arbitrary elementary volume (AEV), $\mathcal{V}$. It is used for dependent variables that vary rapidly in space.

## What is the significance of using $n=3$ when multiplying by $(\gamma^{\mathrm{f}})^{n}$?

The use of $n=3$ ensures that all dependent variables in the nonlinear terms are formally defined in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Boundary forces in the governing equations should be interpreted in an integral sense, which is essential for the immersed boundary method (IBM) framework.

## How is the surface between a phase-p and its surrounding phases represented in the context of Volume Averaging?

The surface between phase-p and its surrounding phases within the averaging volume $\mathcal{V}$ is denoted by $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{p}}$. The normal unit vector on the surface is given by $\boldsymbol{n}^{\mathrm{p}}$.
