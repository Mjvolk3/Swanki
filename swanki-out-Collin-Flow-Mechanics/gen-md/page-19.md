## What is one of the main challenges that need to be addressed to mature the closure models and numerical solution methods of volume-averaged governing equations in simulations?

One of the main challenges is developing mesoscale models that reflect fiber pitting, melt flows, and robust numerical methods that handle all-Mach-number flows.

## What is the purpose of coupling finite-rate chemistry in interpreting arc jet data?

Coupling finite-rate chemistry is vital for interpreting arc jet data accurately because it allows the hypersonic flow solver and the ablative material solver to interact and produce realistic simulations of atmospheric reentry conditions.

## What computational approaches were used in the late 1960s for loosely coupled modeling of planetary entry environments?

In the late 1960s, loosely coupled modeling used Boundary Layer Implicit (BLIMP) code for solving the boundary layer equations for fluids and Charring Material Thermal Response and Ablation Program (CMA) for the material thermal response.

## How does the current approach estimate heat transfer at the wall in simulations of planetary entry?

The current approach derives coefficients from detailed CFD solutions, using Stanton numbers for mass $\left( C_{M} \right)$ and heat $\left( C_{H} \right)$ transfer, and the values at the boundary layer edge for species and temperature to estimate heat transfer at the wall.
