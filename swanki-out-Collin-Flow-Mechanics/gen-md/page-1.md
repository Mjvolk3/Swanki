## What has renewed interest in ablative thermal protection systems, and what are they used for?

The retirement of NASA's Space Shuttle fleet and a US presidential mandate for space exploration beyond low Earth orbit have renewed interest in ablative thermal protection systems. These systems are used for protecting spacecraft by employing blunt body architecture and ablators in mission planning to withstand high temperatures during re-entry.

## Explain how modern predictive tools for ablative material response are being developed.

Modern predictive tools for ablative material response are being developed by leveraging progress in the theory of flows in porous media, advanced experimental techniques, and high-end computing. This allows for $3 \mathrm{D}$ macroscale models with realistic closure coefficients derived from direct numerical simulations of $3 \mathrm{D}$ microscale geometries of actual materials.

## Describe the role of high-end computing in developing predictive tools for ablative materials.

High-end computing enables the development of $3 \mathrm{D}$ macroscale models by providing the computational power necessary for direct numerical simulations of $3 \mathrm{D}$ microscale geometries of actual materials. These simulations help derive realistic closure coefficients used in predictive models for ablative material responses.

## Why is flight data critical for improving models of ablative material responses?

Flight data is critical for refining and validating closure models of ablative material responses because current flight data quantifying these responses remain sparse. Instrumented spacecraft in future missions are expected to provide the needed data.
