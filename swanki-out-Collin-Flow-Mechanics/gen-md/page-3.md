### Card 1
## What marked the renewed interest in the development of ablation response codes and improved ablation models?

The renewed interest in the development of ablation response codes and improved ablation models was driven by the retirement of NASA's Space Shuttle fleet and the availability of new flight data for model assessment and validation.

### Card 2
## Discuss the importance of the Stardust heatshield recovery to ablation model development.

The recovery of the Stardust heatshield enabled in-depth postflight analysis of PICA material. This analysis demonstrated in-depth density variations and volume ablation, which have been crucial for assessing and validating ablation models.

### Card 3
## What data from MSL Entry, Descent, and Landing Instrumentation (MEDLI) revealed discrepancies?

The data from MEDLI and MEDLI-2 provided time traces of in-depth thermal responses of PICA, revealing discrepancies between flight data and engineering predictions.

### Card 4
## What are $\epsilon_{\text{fiber}}$, $d_{\text{pore}}$, and $d_{\text{fiber}}$ in the context of a PICA-class ablator?

Given the text:

- $\epsilon_{\text{fiber}} \simeq 0.1$
- $d_{\text{pore}} \simeq 50-100 \mu \text{m}$
- $d_{\text{fiber}} \approx 5-10 \mu \text{m}$

These variables describe:
- $\epsilon_{\text{fiber}}$: Volume fraction of the carbon-bonded carbon fiber in the preform.
- $d_{\text{pore}}$: Pore diameters in the ablator.
- $d_{\text{fiber}}$: Diameter of the carbon fibers.

### Card 5

## What is the porous structure composition of a low-density carbon/phenolic ablator?

The porous structure of a low-density carbon/phenolic ablator consists of:
- A carbon-bonded carbon fiber preform (skeleton).
- Volume fractions: $\epsilon_{\text{fiber}} \simeq 0.1$.
- Pore diameters: $d_{\text{pore}} \simeq 50-100 \mu \text{m}$.
- Characteristics of carbon fibers: $d_{\text{fiber}} \approx 5-10 \mu \text{m}$.
- Nano-dispersed high-surface-area resin matrix with pore scales: $d_{\text{resin}} \simeq 1-100 \text{~nm}$.
- Volume fraction of matrix: $\epsilon_{\text{resin}} \simeq 0.05-0.15$.

### Card 6
## How is rigidity achieved in a PICA-class ablator's preform?

Rigidity of the preform in a PICA-class ablator is achieved by bonding at fiber intersections using discrete regions of a carbon matrix. This rigidity is coupled with a preferential $\left( \pm 20^{\circ}\right)$ alignment of fibers along a plane of isotropy.
