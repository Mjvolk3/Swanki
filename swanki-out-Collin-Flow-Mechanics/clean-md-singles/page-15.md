4.1. Thermal Transport
}

The effectiveness of lightweight ablators is sensitive to the conductivity of both the condensed phase and the gas phase. The large porosity limits the effective thermal conductivity to low values (typically below $1 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ at room temperature), hindering conduction and limiting the temperature at the bondline between the TPS and the underlying structure. This bondline temperature is a design driver when sizing the thickness of the TPS. The microstructure of low-density ablators is highly anisotropic, usually transverse isotropic, optimized to minimize conductivity in the direction normal to the aeroshell interface with the environment, also known as the outer mold line (Panerai et al. 2017). The effective thermal diffusivity through high-porosity insulators is the result of combined solid conduction, gas conduction, and radiative transfer. These processes are closely coupled to the forced convection imposed by pressure gradients generated by the production of pyrolysis gases. Both radiation and conduction are important in the gas phase. The former is due to high temperatures and their large gradients experienced by ablators during flight. The latter is significant simply because the gas volume fraction is large in high-porosity materials. These transfer modes are both temperature and pressure dependent. Knudsen effects become prominent at low pressures and high temperatures that alter transport at the gas-solid interface. This is often accounted for by correcting the gas thermal conductivity based on the Knudsen number (Daryabeigi et al. 2011, Penide-Fernandez \& Sansoz 2021). A common approach to determining the effective thermal properties of ablators consists of using standard methods such as laser flash analysis, guarded hot plate, or comparative-longitudinal heat flow techniques at the expense of substantial approximations to actual flight conditions. Theoretical developments such as homogenization and volume averaging provide estimates of the effective conductivity of porous materials (Hornung 1997, Whitaker 1999, Leroy et al. 2013, Quintard 2015). These methods are
