(a) Illustration of the ablation phenomenon. The background image is an ablation experiment in the Plasmatron facility at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics. (b-d) Micrographs of different stages of ablation: (b) surface, (c) partially pyrolyzed, and (d) virgin phenolic impregnated carbon ablator (PICA).

Typical heatshield thicknesses range between 3 and $8 \mathrm{~cm}$ depending on the mission. For example, MSL PICA tiles were $3.2 \mathrm{~cm}$ thick, while Stardust used a 6.5 -cm-thick monolithic aeroshell. Other ablators within the lightweight class feature different microstructures and solid phase combinations. For example, AVCOAT, used on Apollo and Orion, is made of polymer microballoons mixed with silica fibers, such that large volume fractions of the material consist of closed porosity, where gas transport is limited. The silicon impregnated reusable ceramic ablator (SIRCA), a lightweight material often used as backshell TPS, is made of a fibrous silica substrate with a silicone impregnant. Cork and certain super-lightweight ablators (SLAs) feature rectangular and honeycomb cells. Length scales in those media are similar to those in PICA. These length scales, together with the tailored fiber arrangement, drive all transport phenomena described hereafter.

During atmospheric entry, the ablative TPS progressively heats up as it encounters a denser atmosphere. Increasing temperatures modify the degree of cross-linking of the polymeric matrix, leading to progressive thermal degradation via pyrolysis. This decomposition process (charring)
