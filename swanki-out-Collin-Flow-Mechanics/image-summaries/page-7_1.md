ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image contains a schematic representation related to the volume averaging method (VAM) that's described in the paper. The figure shows a cross-sectional view of a two-phase system with distinct phase-mask functions represented for two different phases, labeled as α (alpha) and β (beta). The phase-mask functions, denoted as γα and γβ, have values that indicate the presence of a particular phase: they are marked as '1' within the domain of their respective phase, '1/2' at the interface, and '0' elsewhere.

The image also demonstrates how the surface of interface, labeled as Σα, is represented with a normal vector nα pointing outward. There is an indication of a Dirac delta function δ(ξ − ξΣα) along the interface, and its gradient, shown symbolically and represented with arrows, indicates the direction and magnitude of change.

At the bottom of the image, there are plots of the phase-mask functions as a function of position, showing the values transitioning from '1' to '0' along an arbitrary line A-A across the phases, which likely represents a 1D slice through the 3D volume depicted above.

The right side of the image shows a magnified view of an interface with the wall velocity vector w represented by dashed lines with arrowheads, and the effect of the wall on the interface, producing a change in the phase-mask function over time (∂γα/∂t). The Dirac delta function and its interaction with the wall velocity and the normal vector are illustrated.

Overall, the figure visualizes how one defines and uses phase-mask functions in the context of the VAM framework for dealing with multi-phase systems, which is important in the study of ablative porous materials discussed in the paper.
