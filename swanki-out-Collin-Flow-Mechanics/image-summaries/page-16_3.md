ChatGPT figure/image summary: The first set of images from Figure 4:

a. Displayed is a $\mu$-CT voxel image of FiberForm, a material used in thermal protection systems (TPS). The image likely showcases its fibrous and porous structure, which contributes to its thermal insulation properties. Unfortunately, the image itself is not visible in the context you've provided, but based on the description, it would depict the intricate microstructure of FiberForm.

b. This image would be a $\mu$-CT voxel image of carbonized felt, another material used in TPS. Carbonized felt is known for its heat resistance and insulating capabilities. Just like with the previous image, the actual image is not presented here, but it would typically show a carbonized, porous textile structure.

As for the second set of images from Figure 5:

a. This would be an image-based simulation of flow transport within a porous material, which might illustrate how fluids move through the microscopic channels and voids within the material. The image should reveal pathways that allow for the transfer of gases or liquids.

b. This image would depict a simulation for thermal transport. It is likely to visualize the heat distribution and flow within a material, shedding light on how well the material conducts heat or how it traps and insulates against heat transfer.

c. The final image would be related to chemical transport and reactions within a material. This could include illustrations of how chemical reactions occur on a microscopic scale within the structure of the material or how chemicals might distribute within the pores.
