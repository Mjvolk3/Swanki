ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows two representations of a fibrous material as derived from microtomography ($\mu$-CT) data. In the upper image (labeled as 'c'), we see a 3D rendering of the material's fibers, visualized as a cube with numerous elongated, cylindrical components intersecting each other, creating a complex and entangled network that illustrates the material's porous structure. In the lower image (labeled as 'd'), there is a close-up, 2D view of the fibers, providing detail on individual fiber morphology, such as the fiber diameter and the texture of the fiber surfaces. These images help researchers understand the physical characteristics of fibrous materials, like porosity and anisotropy, and are critical for simulations and models that predict the material's properties. The indication of a scale (25 Âµm) in the lower image provides a reference for the size of the features shown.
