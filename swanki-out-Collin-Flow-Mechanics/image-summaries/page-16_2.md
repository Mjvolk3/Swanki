ChatGPT figure/image summary: In the image, you are looking at a 3D numerical simulation that represents the thermal transport in a fibrous porous material used as a Thermal Protection System (TPS). The image shows a complex network of fibers, with different colors on one face of the cube indicating a temperature gradient. This gradient is applied to understand how heat flows through the material's microstructure. The fibers appear in shades of gray and white, suggesting different levels of temperature or perhaps highlighting the complicated paths through which heat can transfer. The blue region around the fibers likely represents the cooler areas within the simulation, while warmer areas transition from green to red as the temperature increases, based on the typical convention used in heat maps.
