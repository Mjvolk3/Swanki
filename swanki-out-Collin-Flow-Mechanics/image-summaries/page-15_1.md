ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a computed microtomography (Âµ-CT) of a porous material with a complex three-dimensional fibrous structure. The upper part of the image illustrates the entire sample volume with a scale indicating that the sides of the cube measure 330 micrometers across, establishing the scale of the porous medium. The lower part of the image provides a close-up view that reveals the intricate web of fibers and the porosity within the material at a higher magnification, marked by a scale of 25 micrometers. This type of detailed imaging is crucial for analyzing the microstructure of materials, such as FiberForm or carbonized felt, and for informing simulations and models related to their physical properties, like thermal and mass transport.
