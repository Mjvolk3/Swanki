ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shared here is displaying a set of mathematical expressions and diagrams related to the text provided. From the context, it seems that the image would contain graphs or illustrations of phase-mask functions, γₚ, possibly graphs showing their values across different domains representing different phases, and maybe even their gradients or time derivatives. These would be related to the mathematical definitions given in the text for the phase-mask functions used in modeling multiphase systems, where phases could include solid, liquid, and gaseous states.

The diagrams could illustrate how the phase-mask value is 1 within the domain of a particular phase, 1/2 at the boundary between phases, and 0 outside the domain. Unfortunately, without seeing the specific image, I can't describe its exact content, but it likely includes visual representations of these concepts to aid in understanding the mathematical definitions and operations explained in the paper.
