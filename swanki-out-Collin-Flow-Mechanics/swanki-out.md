The specific surface area $\sigma_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x})$ is defined as:

$$
\sigma_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x})=\oint_{\Sigma_{\mathrm{p}}} \widehat{G}\left(\mathbf{x}-\xi^{\Sigma}\right) \mathrm{d} \xi^{\Sigma}
$$

## Use the compact support property of the filter function $\widehat{G}$ to simplify the volume average of the gradient operator.

The volume average of the gradient operator given by

$$\overline{\nabla_{\xi} q}=\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \bar{q}-\oint_{\Gamma} q\left(\xi^{\Gamma}\right) \widehat{G}\left(\mathbf{x}-\bar{\xi}^{\Gamma}\right){\mathrm{d} \xi^{\Gamma}}^{0}$$

can use the filter's compact support property $\widehat{G}\left(\mathbf{x}-\xi^{\Gamma}\right)=0$ to drop the surface integral term, simplifying to:

$$
\overline{\nabla_{\xi} q}=\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \bar{q}
$$

- #mathematics, #volume-average

## Explain Leonard's approach to splitting the dependent variables with a focus on large and small eddies.

Leonard's approach involves splitting the dependent variable $\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{x}+\xi)$ into its average part and a fluctuation part:

$$
\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{x}+\xi)=\overline{\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{x}+\xi)+\mathbf{q}^{\prime}(\mathbf{x}+\xi)
$$

This method effectively separates large eddies (represented by the average $\overline{\mathbf{q}}$) from small eddies (represented by the fluctuation $\mathbf{q}^{\prime}$).

- #fluid-dynamics, #eddy-decomposition

## Derive the split of dependent variables for multiphase problems as given.

Given that $\mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{p}}$ is defined only in phase-p, dependent variables are split as:

$$
\mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x}+\xi)=\gamma^{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x}+\xi)\left\langle\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}\right\rangle(\mathbf{x})+\mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{p}}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{x}+\xi)
$$

Here:

- $\mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x}+\xi)$ is the dependent variable in phase-p.
- $\gamma^{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x}+\xi)$ is the phase-p indicator function.
- $\left\langle\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}\right\rangle(\mathbf{x})$ represents the intrinsic average.
- $\mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{p}}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{x}+\xi)$ is the deviation from the intrinsic average.

- #multiphase.flow, #dependent-variables.split, #phase.compute

## What does volume-averaging of the split dependent variables in phase-p yield, and what simplification occurs in practice?

Multiplying Equation 15 by $\gamma^{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x}+\boldsymbol{\xi}) \widehat{G}(\xi)$ and volume averaging yields:

$$
\overline{\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}}=\epsilon_{\mathrm{p}}\left\langle\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}\right\rangle=\epsilon_{\mathrm{p}}\left\langle\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}\right\rangle+\overline{\left(\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}\right)^{\prime \prime}} \Rightarrow \overline{\left(\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}\right)^{\prime \prime}}=0
$$

In practice, order-of-magnitude analysis in porous media cases results in simplifications showing that differences between the two splits can be neglected.

- #volume-average, #porous-media.analysis, #dependent-variables.split

## What are the differences between the splits of dependent variables as outlined in the text, and in what applications is this difference significant?

## Describe the early resin pyrolysis models and the advancement introduced by Goldstein in 1965.

Early resin pyrolysis models used a single kinetic equation of the Arrhenius form to represent decomposition as a function of temperature (Scala \& Gilbert 1962). Goldstein (1965) introduced a two-reaction model, immediately adopted by the community and still in use today.

- #resin-pyrolysis.models, #Arrhenius.equation, #Goldstein.two-reaction.model

## Explain the temperature-dependent advancement of the pyrolysis reaction $\chi_{\mathrm{p}, c}$ in the context of solid phase decomposition using the Arrhenius law.

The advancement of the pyrolysis reaction $\chi_{\mathrm{p}, c}(t)$ is modeled using an Arrhenius law:

$$
\frac{1}{\left(1-\chi_{\mathrm{p}, c}\right)^{m_{\mathrm{p}, c}}} \frac{\partial \chi_{\mathrm{p}, c}}{\partial t} = T^{n_{\mathrm{p}, c}} \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{p}, c} \exp \left(-\frac{\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{p}, c}}{\mathcal{R} T}\right), \quad \forall \mathrm{p} \in \left[1, N_{\mathrm{p}}\right], \forall c \in \left[1, N_{\mathrm{p}, c}\right]
$$

Here, $\chi_{\mathrm{p}, c}=1$ initially and $\chi_{\mathrm{p}, c}=0$ when the subphase is consumed.

The stoichiometric coefficients $\zeta_{\mathrm{p}, c, k}$ quantify the proportions of elements or species $A_{k}$ produced by the decomposition of solid subphases in the chemical system:

$$
M P_{\mathrm{p}, c} \longrightarrow \sum_{k \in \left[1, N_{\mathrm{g}}\right]} \zeta_{\mathrm{p}, c, k} A_{k}, \quad \forall \mathrm{p} \in \left[1, N_{\mathrm{p}}\right], \forall c \in \left[1, N_{\mathrm{p}, c}\right]
$$

## What equation models the conservation of element mass fractions $z_{k}$ in equilibrium chemistry and its boundary conditions?

The equation for conservation of element mass fractions $z_{k}$ under equilibrium chemistry is:

$$
\frac{\partial \epsilon_{\mathrm{g}} \left\langle \rho^{\mathrm{g}} z_{k}^{g} \right\rangle}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot \left(\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}} \left\langle \rho^{\mathrm{g}} z_{k}^{\mathrm{g}} \mathbf{u}^{g} \right\rangle \right) + \nabla \cdot \epsilon_{\mathrm{g}} \left\langle \mathcal{F}_{k}^{g} \right\rangle = \epsilon_{\mathrm{g}} \left\langle \pi_{k}^{\mathrm{g}} \right\rangle, \quad \forall k \in N_{\mathrm{g}}^{e}
$$

- #element-conservation, #chemical-equilibrium

## Describe the boundary conditions used in the derivation of the volume-averaged conservation of energy for multiphase systems.

The boundary conditions include continuity of temperature and heat flux at the interface between phases. Summing the averaged energy equations for all phases eliminates the coupling terms, resulting in the conservation of total volume-averaged energy:

The associated no-surface-accumulation interface boundary conditions for two phases (gas phase $\mathrm{f}$ and bulk phase $\mathrm{b}$) are:

- **Gas Phase ($\mathrm{f}$)**:
- **Bulk Phase ($$\mathrm{b}$)**:
- **$\left\langle T^{\mathrm{f}} \right\rangle \approx \left\langle T^{\mathrm{b}} \right\rangle$** under local thermal equilibrium conditions.
- #energy-conservation, #multiphase-systems

## Summarize how the intrinsic density of a solid phase $\rho_{\mathrm{p}}$ remains constant in time and its implications.

The intrinsic density of a solid phase $\rho_{\mathrm{p}}$ is constant in time if swelling and shrinking are ignored. Consequently, the subphases $\rho_{\mathrm{p}, c} \forall c \in \left[1, N_{\mathrm{p}, c} \right]$ are also constant in time.

- **Implications**: This assumption simplifies the modeling of decomposition kinetics and the calculation of progress variables $\chi_{\mathrm{p}, c}$, which represent the remainder of the solid phase.

- #density-constants, #solid-phase

## How does the concept of progress variables $\chi_{\mathrm{p}, c}$ help in modeling solid decomposition?

Progress variables $\chi_{\mathrm{p}, c}$ represent the remainder of the solid phase during decomposition, where $\chi_{\mathrm{p}, c}=1$ initially and $\chi_{\mathrm{p}, c}=0$ when the subphase is consumed:

$$
\chi_{\mathrm{p}, c}(t)
$$

- **Role**: Models the temporal advancement of decomposition using temperature-dependent kinetics, integrated with the Arrhenius law.

- #progress-variables, #solid-decomposition

## Describe the apparent drag term in momentum equations within porous media.

The apparent drag term in the momentum equation within porous media can be described by splitting the wall pressure into a volume-averaged pressure and a fluctuation pressure, denoted as:

$$\left.p_{\mathrm{f}}\right|^{\Sigma_{f}}=\left\langle p^{\uparrow}\right\rangle+\tilde{p}$$

The surface integral is then modeled to be proportional to the velocity:

$$\left\langle(-\tilde{p} \boldsymbol{I}+\boldsymbol{\tau}) \cdot \boldsymbol{n}^{\mathrm{g}}\right\rangle=-\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}^{2} \mu \underline{\mathbf{K}}^{-1} \cdot\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle$$

Here, $\underline{\mathbf{K}}$ is the Darcy coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}$ is porosity, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle$ is the volume-averaged velocity.

- #fluid-dynamics, #porous-media, #momentum-equation

## What is the Klinkenberg correction to Darcy's coefficient and why is it used?

The Klinkenberg correction to Darcy's coefficient is used to account for noncontinuum flow effects. It is expressed as:

$$\underline{\mathbf{K}}=\underline{\mathbf{K}}_{0} \cdot(\underline{\mathbf{I}}+\underline{\mathbf{b}} / p)$$

Where $\underline{\mathbf{K}}_{0}$ is the continuum flow permeability and $\underline{\mathbf{b}}$ is the slip parameter, both dependent on the microstructure of the material.

- #fluid-dynamics, #porous-media, #noncontinuum-flow

## Derive the surface heat transfer integral sum from the averaged energy equations.

The sum of the averaged energy equations and using the interface boundary conditions leads to surface heat transfer integrals that sum to zero:

$$\frac{\partial\left\langle E_{t}\right\rangle}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot\left(\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}\langle\rho\rangle_{\mathrm{g}}\langle b\rangle_{\mathrm{g}}\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle_{\mathrm{g}}\right)+\nabla \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{N_{\mathrm{g}}}\langle\mathcal{Q}\rangle_{k}=-\nabla \cdot\left(\langle\mathbf{Q}\rangle+\left\langle\mathbf{Q}^{\mathrm{rad}}\right\rangle\right)$$

- #energy-equations, #surface-heat-transfer, #porous-media

## Why is a two-temperature formulation necessary for certain composites like glass-filled polymer composites?

A two-temperature formulation is necessary for composites such as glass-filled polymer composites where significant convective heat transfer occurs due to glass melt and reactions with the carbonized polymer. The temperatures for the gas ($T_{\mathrm{g}}$) and the bulk ($T_{\mathrm{b}}$) need to be separately considered because local thermal equilibrium cannot be assumed.

- #thermal-physics, #two-temperature-model, #composite-materials

## Explain how the volume-averaged heat flux is modeled in single-temperature formulations.

In single-temperature formulations, the volume-averaged heat flux is modeled as:

$$\langle\mathbf{Q}\rangle+\left\langle\mathbf{Q}^{\mathrm{rad}}\right\rangle=-\underline{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathrm{eff}} \cdot \nabla\langle T\rangle$$

Here, $\underline{\mathbf{k}}^{\text {eff }}$ is the effective conductivity tensor of the material, which accounts for porous media radiation, gas, and solid conduction.

- #thermal-physics, #heat-flux, #porous-media

## Under what conditions can deviations from the intrinsic average in porous materials be neglected, and which works discuss this?

Deviations from the intrinsic average in porous materials can be neglected when $d_{\text {pore }} \ll \Delta \ll L$, where $L$ represents macroscale changes within the medium. Under these conditions, deviations have short correlation lengths and are negligible regardless of chemical activity (Whitaker 1999, Breugem et al. 2006).

The bulk diffusion fluxes of mass $\mathcal{F}$ and energy $\mathcal{Q}_i$ are estimated using the driving forces and considering the porosity, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}$, and tortuosity, $\eta$, of the medium. The equations are:

$$
\mathcal{F}=\frac{\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}}{\eta} \mathcal{F}^{*}
$$

and

$$
\mathcal{Q}_{i}=\frac{\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}}{\eta} \mathcal{Q}_{i}^{*}
$$

Here, $\eta$ is the material tortuosity factor.

- #material-science.diffusion, #material-science.bulk-diffusion

## Define the material tortuosity factor $\eta$ in the context of bulk diffusion in porous media.

The material tortuosity factor $\eta$ represents the complexity of the pathways that fluid must navigate through a porous medium. In the context of bulk diffusion, $\eta$ modifies the intrinsic diffusion flux $\mathcal{F}^{*}$ and energy flux $\mathcal{Q}^{*}$ as follows:

$$
\mathcal{F}=\frac{\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}}{\eta} \mathcal{F}^{*}
$$

and

$$
\mathcal{Q}_{i}=\frac{\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}}{\eta} \mathcal{Q}_{i}^{*}
$$

where $\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}$ is the porosity.

## Compare old models with new finite-rate ablation models for the carbon-air system in terms of their predictions.

Old models (e.g., Park 1976, Zhluktov & Abe 1999) tend to favor the formation of $\mathrm{CO}_2$ over $\mathrm{CO}$, which affects the temperature and recession. New finite-rate ablation models tend to favor $\mathrm{CO}$ formation, leading to higher temperatures and lower recession. These newer models show better agreement with experimental data (Candler 2019).

## What are the different boundary conditions depicted in Figure 6 when coupling the flow to a porous wall?

%

The different boundary conditions are:

1. **Uncoupled**: There is no modification to the velocity profile; the flow and porous surface interact independently.
2. **Slip velocity**: There is some slip at the interface surface, indicated by slight shifts in the velocity profiles at the boundary.
3. **Jump in shear stress**: There is a significant adjustment in the velocity profile, with conspicuous jumps in shear forces at the interface.
4. **Fully coupled**: The velocity profiles adjust smoothly into the porous surface without any discontinuities or slips.

%

In the "fully coupled" boundary condition, the velocity profiles adjust smoothly into the porous surface, seamlessly integrating the boundary layer edge and porous material surface without any jumps or slips. In contrast:

- **Slip velocity**: There is a minor slip at the interface, causing a slight shift in the boundary layer.

## Explain the impact of pyrolysis on the properties of the porous material within the context of thermal protection systems (TPS).

Pyrolysis leads to changes in material density and porosity at the pore scale, which transitions from nanometer to micrometer scale. This significantly affects the transport properties of the porous material, impacting the effectiveness of TPS.

- #engineering, #material-science.porous-media

## What are the temperature ranges in which coking effects occur during pyrolysis, and what chemical interactions are observed?

Coking effects occur at temperatures between 1,100 and $1,400 \mathrm{~K}$, where hydrocarbons interact with char and deposit solid carbon, releasing hydrogen.

## Define the Knudsen number and describe its relevance in the context of momentum transport within ablative systems.

The Knudsen number (\mathrm{Kn}) is defined as the ratio of the mean free path of gas molecules to a characteristic physical length scale, which, in this case, is the pore scale:

$$
\mathrm{Kn} = \frac{\lambda}{L}
$$

In ablative systems, \mathrm{Kn} numbers within the porous ablator range from transitional (0.1 \lesssim \mathrm{Kn} \lesssim 100) to slip (0.02 \lesssim \mathrm{Kn} \lesssim 0.1) regimes, indicating the importance of wall collisions and impacting gas transport behavior.

- #fluid-dynamics, #thermodynamics.knudsen-number

## Discuss how Fick's law applies to diffusive transport in porous ablators and mention the key parameter that modifies the diffusion coefficient.

Fick's law models diffusive transport and maintains the same form across regimes, from continuum to rarefied. The effective diffusion coefficient is modified by a tortuosity factor $\eta$ to account for the complex pathways in the porous structure:

$$
J = -D_{\text{eff}} \nabla c \quad \text{where} \quad D_{\text{eff}} = \frac{D_{\text{ref}}}{\eta}
$$

Here, $J$ is the diffusive flux, $D_{\text{ref}}$ is the reference diffusivity, and $c$ is the concentration of the diffusing species.

- #diffusion, #material-science.fick's-law

## Explain the significance of the Thiele number in modeling competing diffusion-reaction processes within porous ablators.

The Thiele number (\Phi) is a dimensionless number that characterizes the ratio of the reaction rate to the diffusion rate. In oxygen-rich environments, low Thiele numbers $(\Phi \rightarrow 0)$ indicate a reaction-limited regime, leading to a larger ablation zone with graded in-depth porosity:

$$
\Phi = \left(\frac{R}{D}\right)^{1/2}
$$

where $R$ is the reaction rate and $D$ is the diffusivity.

- #reaction-engineering, #diffusion.thiele-number

## What is the role of hydrodynamic dispersion in diffusive transport within porous ablators, and why can it be neglected?

Hydrodynamic dispersion effects on diffusive transport can be neglected due to the small Péclet number for mass transfer in the continuum regime and limited gas phase collisions in the rarefied regime:

$$
\text{Péclet number} \quad \text{Pe} = \frac{uL}{D}
$$

In this context, $u$ is the fluid velocity, $L$ is the characteristic length, and $D$ is the diffusivity. Given the small pore scales, $\mathrm{Pe}$ is small, making hydrodynamic dispersion negligible.

- #transport-phenomena, #fluid-dynamics.peclet-number

## What characterizes the late phase of an entry trajectory in terms of temperatures and char reactivity?

During the late phase of an entry trajectory, temperatures are moderate and the char reactivity to oxygen is low. In contrast, high Thiele numbers $(\Phi \rightarrow \infty)$ pertain to a diffusion-limited regime, where all available oxygen reacts near the surface, leading to rapid material recession.

- #materials.sci, #combustion

## What happens at near-unit Thiele numbers in the context of an entry trajectory?

At near-unit Thiele numbers, diffusion and reaction processes balance each other, and a reaction zone of the order of the pore scale is produced, as described in the literature (Lachaud et al. 2010; Ferguson et al. 2016, 2017; Vignoles et al. 2018).

$$
\Phi \approx 1
$$

- #materials.sci, #chemical-reactions

## Describe the difference in reactivity between the charred matrix and carbon fibers in an entry trajectory scenario.

From the analysis of arc jet experiments, the charred matrix reacts with oxygen faster than the carbon fibers do. This leads to near-surface regions with large pore scales, around the scale of the FiberForm pore scale, and results in the needling of fibers.

- #materials.sci, #combustion

## What is needed for nonequilibrium conditions in thermal processes for porous ablators?

For nonequilibrium conditions, two-temperature models are needed. Since Péclet numbers are small due to the small pore scale and typical values of velocity and thermal diffusivity in porous ablators, solid and gas phases are often in thermal equilibrium under most conditions.

$$
\text{Péclet number} \rightarrow \mathrm{small}
$$

## Explain the objective of Volume Averaging Method (VAM) in the context of ablative porous media.

The goal of VAM is to derive governing equations of the dynamics at the macroscale by upscaling microscale equations through volume averaging, making it compatible with modern numerical methods.

- #fluid-mechanics, #materials.sci

## How does VAM relate to IBM and LES methods in the study of ablative TPS materials?

VAM connects to IBM by extending the governing equations from valid domains in each phase to the entire space, $\mathbb{R}^3$. The link to LES is made by outlining the relation between VAM's spatial smoothing and LES's filtering approach. The key difference is in how VAM splits dependent variables into averaged and unresolved scales.

\gamma^{\mathrm{p}}(\xi, t)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}
1 & \forall \xi \in \mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{p}}^{3} \\
1 / 2 & \xi=\xi^{\Sigma} \in \Sigma_{\mathrm{p}} \\
0 & \text { Otherwise }
\end{array}\right.

The subspace $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{p}}^{3}$ where the phase-p is defined includes:

$$
\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{p}}^{3}=\mathbb{R}_{0}^{3}\left(=\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{f}}^{3}\right), \mathbb{R}_{1}^{3}, \mathbb{R}_{2}^{3}, \ldots, \mathbb{R}_{N_{\mathrm{p}}}^{3}
$$

Where $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{f}}^{3}$ is the subspace of the fluid phase and $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{i}}^{3}$ is the subspace of solid phase-i. $N_{\mathrm{p}}$ is the number of solid phases.

$$
\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}(\xi, t)=\left[\gamma^{\mathrm{p}}(\xi, t)\right]^{n} \mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{p}}(\xi, t)
$$

Where $n$ is an arbitrary natural number greater than 1.

- #dependent-variables, #phase-mask-function, #mathematical-modeling

## What is the role of the power $n$ in the expression $\left[\gamma^{\mathrm{p}}(\xi, t)\right]^{n}$?

The power $n$ in $\left[\gamma^{\mathrm{p}}(\xi, t)\right]^{n}$ generalizes the phase-mask function and aids in extending the validity of governing equations to the entire space $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. It does not affect the properties of the time derivative or gradients of the phase-mask function.

- #power-n, #phase-mask-function, #mathematical-modeling

## Why is the value of the phase-mask function arbitrary at the interface $\Sigma_{\mathrm{p}}$?

The phase-mask function value is arbitrary at the interface $\Sigma_{\mathrm{p}}$, often set to $\frac{1}{2}$ because this intermediate value simplifies the modeling of the phase boundary, even though $\gamma^{\mathrm{p}}(\xi, t)$ is defined only in an integral sense at discontinuities.

Phase-mask functions $\gamma_{\alpha}$ and $\gamma_{\beta}$ are used to distinguish between two phases, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, in a multi-phase system. The values of these functions are:

- '1' within the domain of their respective phase
- '1/2' at the interface
- '0' elsewhere

These functions help in extending the validity of the governing equations from $\mathbb{R}_{\text{p}}^{3}$ to the entire space $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The interface, $\Sigma_{\alpha}$, has a normal vector $\mathbf{n}_{\alpha}$ pointing outward, and the Dirac delta function $\delta(\xi - \xi_{\Sigma_{\alpha}})$ represents the interface. The image also shows phase-mask function values transitioning from '1' to '0' along a line, as well as a plot of the wall velocity vector affecting the interface.

The effect of the wall velocity on the phase-mask function $\gamma_{\alpha}$ is illustrated at the bottom-right section of the image. The wall velocity vector, $\mathbf{w}$, is shown using dashed lines with arrowheads, indicating its direction. This velocity impacts the interface, producing a change in the phase-mask function over time, represented as $\frac{\partial \gamma_{\alpha}}{\partial t}$.

## Given the momentum equation for compressible flow in the fluid phase with moving boundaries, what is the term $\mathbf{F}^{\Sigma_{\mathrm{f}}}$?

## How do you extend a governing equation from $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{f}}^{3}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ by using the phase-mask?

To extend a governing equation from $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{f}}^{3}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, you multiply the equation by the phase-mask of the fluid phase, $(\gamma^{\mathrm{f}})^3$. Using the differentiation by parts and the properties of the gradients of the phase-mask function, you can rearrange the terms to define all dependent variables in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.

## Explanation of the volume average of a dependent variable $\overline{\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}}(\mathbf{x})$ before and after incorporating the even weight function $G(\xi-\mathbf{x})$.

What is the mathematical expression for the volume average of a dependent variable $\overline{\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}}(\mathbf{x})$?

$$
\overline{\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}}(\mathbf{x})=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}} \mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}(\xi) \widehat{G}(\xi-\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \xi=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}} \mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}(\xi) \widehat{G}(\mathbf{x}-\xi) \mathrm{d} \xi=\left[\left(\gamma^{\mathrm{p}} \mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{p}}\right) \star \widehat{G}\right]

## Top-hat filter and its use in the study of porous media.

What is the expression for the top-hat filter $\widehat{G}(\xi-\mathbf{x})$?

$$
\widehat{G}(\xi-\mathbf{x})=\frac{G(\xi-\mathbf{x})}{\mathcal{V}}= \begin{cases}1 / \mathcal{V} & \forall|\xi-\mathbf{x}|<\Delta / 2 \\ 0 & \forall|\xi-\mathbf{x}| \geq \Delta / 2\end{cases}

## Importance of the REV in locally homogeneous systems for the volume averaging process.

What is the Representative Elementary Volume (REV) in the context of locally homogeneous systems?

The REV is a volume large enough to ensure that variables are smooth, and small enough compared to large inhomogeneities in the system, allowing for accurate volume averaging.

## Definition and importance of the intrinsic average of a quantity $\left\langle\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}\right\rangle(\mathbf{x})$.

What is the intrinsic average of a quantity $\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}$, and why is it important?

$$
\left\langle\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}\right\rangle(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{\epsilon_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x})}\left[\left(\gamma^{\mathrm{p}} \mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{p}}\right) \star \widehat{G}\right]=\frac{1}{\epsilon_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x})} \overline{\mathbf{q}^{\mathrm{p}}}(\mathbf{x})
$$

The intrinsic average represents the physically meaningful dependent variables in a phase, normalized by the volume fraction $\epsilon_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x})$.

## Surface species and superficial average quantities on reactive surfaces.

How are surface species on reactive surfaces averaged, and how does this relate to superficial average quantities?

$$
\overline{\mathbf{q}^{\Sigma_{\mathrm{p}}}}(\mathbf{x})=\left[\mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{p}}(\xi) \delta\left(\xi^{\Sigma}-\xi\right) \star \widehat{G}\right]=\oint_{\Sigma_{\mathrm{p}}} \mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{p}}\left(\xi^{\Sigma}\right) \widehat{G}\left(\mathbf{x}-\xi^{\Sigma}\right) \mathrm{d} \xi^{\Sigma}
$$

Surface species are volume-averaged to turn them into superficial average quantities, reflecting the dependency on unit averaging volume.

## Definition of volume fraction $\epsilon_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x})$ and its use in intrinsic averaging.

What is the expression for the volume fraction $\epsilon_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x})$, and how is it used in intrinsic averaging?

$$
\epsilon_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x})=\overline{\gamma^{\mathrm{p}}}(\mathbf{x})
$$

The volume fraction $\epsilon_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x})$ is used to normalize the intrinsic average, ensuring the averages are representative of phase-specific properties within the AEV.
