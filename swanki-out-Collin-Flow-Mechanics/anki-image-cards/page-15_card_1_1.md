The imaging techniques used in Figure 4 are computed microtomography (μ-CT) for both FiberForm (panels a, c) and carbonized felt (panels b, d). μ-CT provides detailed three-dimensional voxel images, enabling the visualization of the fibrous structure and porosity at the microscale. This level of detail is pivotal for analyzing the microstructure and informing simulations and models of the materials' physical properties, such as thermal and mass transport.

## What scales are used to measure the sample volumes in the μ-CT images provided in Figure 4, and why are these important?

In the μ-CT images of Figure 4, the upper part of the image displays the entire sample volume with a side length of 330 micrometers, while the lower part provides a close-up view with a scale of 25 micrometers. These scales are important because they define the resolution and detail of the fibrous structure and porosity, which are crucial for accurate analysis and simulation of the material’s properties.
