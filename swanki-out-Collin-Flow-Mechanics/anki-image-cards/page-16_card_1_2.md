    What are image-based simulations of effective properties, and what phenomena do they typically study?
  
    %
  
    Image-based simulations of effective properties are computational models used to analyze the behavior of various transport phenomena through complex media. 

    - (a) Flow transport: Studies the movement and velocity of fluids through porous media (Borner et al. 2017).
    - (b) Thermal transport: Examines heat transfer mechanisms within different materials (Semeraro et al. 2021).
    - (c) Chemistry: Investigates chemical reactions and transport within porous structures (Ferguson et al. 2016, 2017).

    These simulations are essential for understanding the permeability, flow resistance, thermal conductivity, and reaction kinetics within porous materials.

    How is fluid flow through a porous medium visually represented in simulations, and what can be inferred about the flow characteristics?

    Fluid flow through a porous medium is visually represented in simulations by colorful streamlines that indicate the direction and velocity of the fluid. Different colors typically represent varying velocities, as indicated by the legend (ranging from 1.00 m/s to 7.50 m/s).

    The white structures in the visualization likely denote the solid parts of the medium, such as fibers or other obstacles. This representation helps in analyzing phenomena like:

    - Permeability: The ability of the fluid to pass through the medium.
    - Flow resistance: The opposition encountered by the fluid while moving through the medium.
    - Overall behavior: The fluidâ€™s movement and interaction with the porous material.

    These insights are crucial for understanding how fluids behave in complex geometrical structures.
