The images depict the fibrous materials as follows:
1. In the upper image ('c'):
   - 3D rendering of the material's fibers
   - Numerous elongated, cylindrical components intersect each other
   - Creates a complex and entangled network
   - Illustrates the material's porous structure

2. In the lower image ('d'):
   - Close-up, 2D view of the fibers
   - Detail on individual fiber morphology
   - Features such as fiber diameter and surface texture
   - The scale (25 Î¼m) provides a reference for the size of the features shown

Computed microtomography ($\mu$-CT) is crucial in the analysis of fibrous materials because it:

- Provides detailed 3D and 2D visualizations of the material's structure.
- Reveals the complex network and porous characteristics of the material.
- Offers insight into individual fiber morphology, including diameter and surface texture.
- Helps researchers assess physical characteristics such as porosity and anisotropy.
- Supports simulations and models that predict material properties.
