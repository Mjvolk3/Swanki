    Why is detailed imaging from computed microtomography (μ-CT) important for analyzing materials like FiberForm and carbonized felt?

    % 

    Detailed imaging from computed microtomography (μ-CT) is crucial for analyzing the microstructure of materials such as FiberForm and carbonized felt. It provides insights into the intricate web of fibers and porosity within the material, which informs simulations and models related to their physical properties, such as thermal and mass transport.
