Explain the differences between the four boundary conditions (a) uncoupled, (b) slip velocity, (c) jump in shear stress, and (d) fully coupled as shown in the figure.

%

(a) Uncoupled: The flow has a straight velocity profile with no interaction with the porous surface. The mass and energy balances are independent of each other.
(b) Slip velocity: Allows for some slip at the interface, modifying the velocity profile near the porous surface. 
(c) Jump in shear stress: Shows a significant adjustment with a "jump" in shear forces at the interface, altering the velocity profile near the surface.
(d) Fully coupled: The boundary layer edge and porous material surface are fully integrated, leading to a smooth velocity profile transition into the porous surface.

- $y_{\mathrm{e}}$: Boundary layer edge species mass fractions.
- $h_{\mathrm{e}}$: Specific enthalpy at the boundary layer edge.
- $p_{\mathrm{e}}$: Pressure at the boundary layer edge.
