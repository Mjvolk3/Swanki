Ablative thermal protection systems are primarily used for the thermal protection of spacecraft. The renewed interest in these systems is due to the retirement of NASA's Space Shuttle fleet and the US mandate to develop technologies enabling human space exploration beyond low Earth orbit. These systems are essential in mission planning, especially for blunt body architecture spacecraft.
