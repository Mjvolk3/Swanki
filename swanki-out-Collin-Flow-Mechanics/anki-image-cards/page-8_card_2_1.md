For dependent variables that vary rapidly in space, the Volume Averaging Method (VAM) defines superficial averaged quantities of interest by averaging the variables over an arbitrary elementary volume (AEV), denoted as $\mathcal{V}$.

## What are the applications of the defined volumes and surfaces of solid and fluid phases in an averaging volume $\mathcal{V}$?

The defined volumes and surfaces of solid and fluid phases within an averaging volume $\mathcal{V}$ are used to model multiphase systems. The phase volume $\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{p}}$ represents the space occupied by a specific phase within $\mathcal{V}$, and the interface surface between the phase and surroundings is denoted by $\boldsymbol{n}^{\mathrm{p} / (\cdot)}$.
