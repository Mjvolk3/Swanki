In an averaging volume $\mathcal{V}$, at a location $\mathbf{x}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$:
- The defined volume space of a phase within $\mathcal{V}$ is denoted by $\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{p}}$.
- The surface between phase-p and its adjoining $$ (\cdot) $$ is represented by $\boldsymbol{n}^{\mathrm{p} /(\cdot)}$.
- $\Delta$ represents the weight function compact support width.

## How does VAM define superficial averaged quantities for rapidly varying dependent variables in space for an arbitrary elementary volume (AEV) $\mathcal{V}$?

For dependent variables that vary rapidly in space, Volume Averaging Method (VAM) defines superficial averaged quantities by averaging the variables over an arbitrary elementary volume (AEV) $\mathcal{V}$.
