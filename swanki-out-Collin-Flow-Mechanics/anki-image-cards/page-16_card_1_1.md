Figure 5 illustrates image-based simulations of effective properties for different transport phenomena:
1. (a) Flow transport (Borner et al. 2017)
2. (b) Thermal transport (Semeraro et al. 2021)
3. (c) Chemistry (Ferguson et al. 2016, 2017)

Part (a) of Figure 5 shows a computer-generated visualization of fluid flow through a porous medium. The colorful lines represent fluid streamlines, demonstrating the direction and velocity of the flow, where various colors correspond to different velocities according to the legend at the bottom (ranging from 1.00 m/s to 7.50 m/s). The white structures represent the solid framework of the porous medium.
