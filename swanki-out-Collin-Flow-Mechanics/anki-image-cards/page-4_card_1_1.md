What various stages of the ablation process are depicted in panels (b), (c), and (d) of the provided image?

%
Panel (b): Shows the surface of the material that might have already undergone some ablation, indicated by the fibers being exposed and looking frayed or melted.  
Panel (c): Presents the material in a state of partial pyrolysis with less defined fibers, likely due to thermal degradation.  
Panel (d): Depicts the virgin material in its initial, unexposed state with a clearer and more uniform structure of fibers before any ablation or pyrolysis.

What are the key thermal and chemical processes involved in the ablation of thermal protection system (TPS) materials, as illustrated in panel (a)?

%
The key thermal and chemical processes in ablation, as illustrated in panel (a), include pyrolysis, sublimation, and oxidation. These processes occur at various temperature ranges as the heatshield material encounters extreme temperatures during atmospheric re-entry.
