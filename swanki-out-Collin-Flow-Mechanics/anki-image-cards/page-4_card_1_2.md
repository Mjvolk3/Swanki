Panel (a) in the image illustrates the ablation process occurring in thermal protection systems (TPS) materials during atmospheric re-entry. It provides a schematic overlay describing various thermal and chemical processes such as pyrolysis, sublimation, and oxidation, along with the temperature ranges at which these processes occur. The background image indicates the experimental setup capturing the glow of hot material undergoing ablation.

Panels (b), (c), and (d) show different stages of the ablation process in TPS materials:

- Panel (b): Shows the surface of the material that has already undergone some ablation, with exposed and frayed or melted fibers.
- Panel (c): Displays material in a state of partial pyrolysis, with less defined fibers due to thermal degradation.
- Panel (d): Depicts the virgin material in its initial state, showing a clear and uniform fiber structure before any ablation or pyrolysis.
