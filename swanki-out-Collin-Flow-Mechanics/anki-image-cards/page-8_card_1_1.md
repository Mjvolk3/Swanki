### Card 1

For dependent variables that vary rapidly in space, VAM defines superficial averaged quantities by averaging the variables over an arbitrary elementary volume (AEV). What is the significance of the variables $\mathbf{x}$, $\xi$, and $\mathcal{V}$ in the associated image?

- $\mathbf{x}$: The location of the AEV in the space $\mathbb{R}^3$.
- $\xi$: A position vector within the AEV.
- $\mathcal{V}$: The elementary volume where variables are averaged.

### Card 2

In the context of volume averaging as shown in the figure, what do the subscripts on volumes (e.g., $V_p$) and the interfaces (e.g., $Σ_{0/1}$) represent?

- $V_p$: Sub-volumes within the AEV corresponding to different phases or solids (e.g., $V_0$ for fluid phase, $V_1, V_2, \ldots$ for different solid phases).
- $Σ_{0/1}$, $Σ_{1/2}$: Surfaces between different phases within the AEV, indicated by dashed lines. These interfaces separate the volume spaces of different phases.
