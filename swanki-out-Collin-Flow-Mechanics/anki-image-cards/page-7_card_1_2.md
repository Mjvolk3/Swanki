The phase-mask functions $\gamma_{\alpha}$ and $\γ_{\beta}$ have the following values:
- Within their respective phases: $\gamma_{\alpha} = 1$ and $\γ_{\β} = 1$.
- At the interfaces: $\gamma_{\α} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\γ_{\β} = \frac{1}{2}$.
- Outside their respective phases: $\γ_{\α} = 0$ and $\γ_{\β} = 0$.

The magnified view on the right side of the image illustrates:
- The interface denoted by $\Sigma_{\alpha}$ with the normal vector $\mathbf{n}_{\α}$.
- The representation of the Dirac delta function $\delta(\xi - \xi\Sigma_{\α})$ along the interface.
- The effect of the wall velocity vector $\mathbf{w}$ on the phase-mask function over time $\partial \gamma_{\	alpha}/\partial t$.
