    Part (b) illustrates the thermal transport in a fibrous porous material used as a Thermal Protection System (TPS). The image shows a complex network of fibers with a temperature gradient that helps understand how heat flows through the material's microstructure. Different colors indicate varying temperatures, with blue regions representing cooler areas and warmer regions transitioning from green to red.

    Figure 5 illustrates the following simulations:
    
    (a) Flow transport, based on the work of Borner et al. (2017).
    
    (b) Thermal transport, based on the work of Semeraro et al. (2021).
    
    (c) Chemistry, based on the work of Ferguson et al. (2016, 2017).
