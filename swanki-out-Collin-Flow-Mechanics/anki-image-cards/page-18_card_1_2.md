What are the different boundary conditions depicted in Figure 6 when coupling the flow to a porous wall?

The different boundary conditions are:
1. **Uncoupled**: There is no modification to the velocity profile; the flow and porous surface interact independently.
2. **Slip velocity**: There is some slip at the interface surface, indicated by slight shifts in the velocity profiles at the boundary.
3. **Jump in shear stress**: There is a significant adjustment in the velocity profile, with conspicuous jumps in shear forces at the interface.
4. **Fully coupled**: The velocity profiles adjust smoothly into the porous surface without any discontinuities or slips.

### Anki Card 2

How does the "fully coupled" boundary condition differ from "slip velocity" and "jump in shear stress" in the context of coupling flow to a porous wall, as shown in Figure 6?

In the "fully coupled" boundary condition, the velocity profiles adjust smoothly into the porous surface, seamlessly integrating the boundary layer edge and porous material surface without any jumps or slips. In contrast:
- **Slip velocity**: There is a minor slip at the interface, causing a slight shift in the boundary layer.
- **Jump in shear stress**: There is a pronounced adjustment in the velocity profile, with a significant jump in shear forces at the interface.
