Diagrams (a) and (b) from the figure represent:

1. **Diagram (a)**: Predicted surface temperature of the heatshield at 70 seconds after atmospheric entry, with the color scale indicating temperatures in Kelvin.
2. **Diagram (b)**: Differential recession, i.e., material loss due to ablation, with the color scale indicating the depth of recession in meters.

Both diagrams provide insights into the thermal protection system's performance during the Mars Science Laboratory's atmospheric entry, adapted from Meurisse et al. (2018).

## What does the differential recession depicted in diagram (b) indicate about the heatshield's performance?

The differential recession, shown in diagram (b), indicates:

1. The extent of material loss due to ablation during the atmospheric entry.
2. Darker blue areas represent more significant recession, implying higher material loss, while lighter blue to green areas represent less significant recession.

This highlights the areas of the heatshield that experienced the most stress and material degradation, which is crucial for evaluating the thermal protection system's effectiveness for the Mars Science Laboratory.
