What do the $\mu$-CT voxel images reveal about materials like FiberForm and carbonized felt?

%

The $\mu$-CT voxel images reveal crucial details about the material structure. For FiberForm, the upper image (labeled "c") shows a 3D rendering of the fibers, highlighting the complex, entangled network and porous structure. The lower image (labeled "d") offers a close-up 2D view of individual fibers, providing information on fiber diameter and surface texture. These images are instrumental in understanding physical characteristics such as porosity and anisotropy, which are vital for predictive simulations and models.

Why is the scale indication (25 µm) important in the lower image (labeled as 'd')?

%

The scale indication (25 µm) is critical in the lower image (labeled as 'd') because it provides a reference for the size of the features shown. This allows researchers to accurately measure and analyze the dimensions of the fibers and their morphology, facilitating a better understanding of the material's microstructural characteristics.
