Phase-mask functions $\gamma_{\alpha}$ and $\gamma_{\beta}$ are used to distinguish between two phases, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, in a multi-phase system. The values of these functions are:

- '1' within the domain of their respective phase
- '1/2' at the interface
- '0' elsewhere

These functions help in extending the validity of the governing equations from $\mathbb{R}_{\text{p}}^{3}$ to the entire space $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The interface, $\Sigma_{\alpha}$, has a normal vector $\mathbf{n}_{\alpha}$ pointing outward, and the Dirac delta function $\delta(\xi - \xi_{\Sigma_{\alpha}})$ represents the interface. The image also shows phase-mask function values transitioning from '1' to '0' along a line, as well as a plot of the wall velocity vector affecting the interface.

## How is the effect of wall velocity on the phase-mask function $\gamma_{\alpha}$ represented in the image?

The effect of the wall velocity on the phase-mask function $\gamma_{\alpha}$ is illustrated at the bottom-right section of the image. The wall velocity vector, $\mathbf{w}$, is shown using dashed lines with arrowheads, indicating its direction. This velocity impacts the interface, producing a change in the phase-mask function over time, represented as $\frac{\partial \gamma_{\alpha}}{\partial t}$. 

The interaction involves the Dirac delta function $\delta(\xi - \xi_{\Sigma_{\alpha}})$, showing the influence of the wall on the phase over time and its interaction with the normal vector $\mathbf{n}_{\alpha}$.
