Afterword

The 1960s marked a pivotal time in the establishment of cell biology as a significant branch within the biological sciences. Initially rooted in interdisciplinary fields such as cytology and biochemistry, cell biology evolved into a distinct and enduring discipline. This transformation was largely due to the adoption of innovative research techniques, notably cell fractionation and electron microscopy. These advanced methodologies enabled researchers to explore cellular mechanisms previously inaccessible to other disciplines. Pioneers in cell biology, often in collaboration with biochemists and molecular biologists, employed these tools to uncover mechanistic explanations for a broad spectrum of cell functions at various organizational levels. The elucidation of these mechanisms epitomizes the pursuit of mechanistic explanations in science.

Cell biology is characterized by its continuous evolution and its ability to redefine its role relative to other scientific disciplines. Two unique features define cell biology: its focus on the diversity in structure and function across different cells, organs, and organisms, and its status as an interdisciplinary hub. This nexus integrates findings from physical, chemical, developmental, and other scientific investigations to achieve a comprehensive understanding of cellular processes. The emphasis on various contributing disciplines has shifted over time. During the 1950s and 1960s, collaborations with biochemists were crucial. In contrast, recent decades have seen a closer alignment with molecular biology. For instance, the American Society for Cell Biology's establishment of the journal "Cell Regulation" in November 1989 reflects this shift. The journal's mission was to publish significant research in molecular cell biology, covering a wide range of topics including cell regulation, signal transduction, and the integration of information.

In 1992, the journal was renamed "Molecular Biology of the Cell," further broadening its focus to encompass original research on the molecular aspects of cell structure and function. Modern cell biologists, despite a more molecular focus, continue the tradition of explaining cellular phenomena by identifying the underlying mechanisms. The foundational work done by researchers from 1940 to 1970 set the stage for this ongoing scientific endeavor. This historical narrative not only offers a perspective on contemporary cell biology but also serves as a prime example of how new scientific disciplines can emerge from the intersections of existing ones. Furthermore, it underscores the importance of mechanistic explanations in advancing scientific knowledge. Unlike traditional scientific success measured by new laws, cell biology has progressed by providing explanations for previously mysterious phenomena. These explanations, centered on mechanisms, are now recognized as fundamental in the biological sciences and beyond. By engaging with other philosophers of science, I continue to draw inspiration from cell biology to refine our understanding of scientific explanation, thus contributing to a philosophical revolution that aligns more closely with the actual practices of biology.
