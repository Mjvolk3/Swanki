## What were some of the new research techniques that contributed to the establishment of cell biology as a distinct discipline?

Cell biology established itself as a distinct and enduring discipline through the deployment of new research techniques such as cell fractionation and electron microscopy. These techniques enabled practitioners to explore mechanisms previously inaccessible to cytology and biochemistry.

## Describe two distinct features that set cell biology apart from other disciplines.

The two most distinctive features of cell biology are:
1. The attention to variations in structure and function across cells from different organs and organisms.
2. Its status as an interdisciplinary nexus integrating findings from physical, chemical, developmental, and other investigations to understand the cell.

## How has the interdisciplinary nature of cell biology changed from the 1950s to recent times?

In the 1950s and 1960s, cell biology's interdisciplinary nature was mostly characterized by collaborations with biochemists. More recently, cell biology has forged closer ties with molecular biology, as evidenced by the establishment of the journal *Cell Regulation* in 1989, which publishes contributions in molecular cell biology.

## How did the establishment of the journal *Cell Regulation* in 1989 reflect changes in the scope of cell biology?

The establishment of the journal *Cell Regulation* in 1989 reflects the shift in cell biology toward molecular biology. The journal's scope covers a broad range of research contributions in molecular cell biology, indicating how the discipline had grown and evolved.
