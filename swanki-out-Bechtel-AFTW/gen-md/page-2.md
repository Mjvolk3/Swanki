## Explain how the journal "Cell Regulation" evolved over time and what its focus shifted towards in the 1990s. Additionally, describe how this evolution reflected changes in cell biology research.

The journal "Cell Regulation" evolved to become "Molecular Biology of the Cell" in 1992, shifting its focus to include "original research concerning the molecular aspects of cell structure and function." This rebranding and refocusing mirrored changes in cell biology research, as the field began to concentrate more on molecular-level processes. Advances made between 1940-1970 laid the groundwork for this shift by emphasizing the discovery of mechanisms rather than the formulation of new scientific laws.

## According to the paper, what type of explanations are recognized as ubiquitous in biological sciences and are crucial for understanding cell biology phenomena?

The paper emphasizes that the articulation of mechanisms that account for phenomena is a type of explanation recognized as ubiquitous in biological sciences. This approach is crucial for understanding cell biology phenomena, as it goes beyond merely stating new scientific laws to explain previously inexplicable events.

## What impact did the revolution in cell biology have on the philosophy of science, as discussed in the paper?

The revolution in cell biology half a century ago is now fueling a movement to reenergize the philosophy of science. This impact is achieved by aligning philosophical inquiries more closely with the actual enterprise of biological sciences, emphasizing the importance of mechanistic explanations.

## How did cell biologists between 1940-1970 contribute to the field, and what was their approach to advancing scientific knowledge?

Cell biologists between 1940-1970 contributed to the field by discovering mechanisms responsible for cell phenomena rather than advancing new scientific laws. This approach involved providing explanations that enhanced understanding of previously inexplicable phenomena, setting the stage for future research focused on molecular-level processes.
