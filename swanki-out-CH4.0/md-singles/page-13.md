4.3. The Bias-Variance Trade-off
}

So far in our discussion of linear models for regression, we have assumed that the

Section 1.2 form and number of basis functions are both given. We have also seen that the use of maximum likelihood can lead to severe over-fitting if complex models are trained using data sets of limited size. However, limiting the number of basis functions to avoid over-fitting has the side effect of limiting the flexibility of the model to capture interesting and important trends in the data. Although a regularization term can control over-fitting for models with many parameters, this raises the question of how to determine a suitable value for the regularization coefficient \(\lambda\). Seeking the
