## In the context of linear regression, how is a simple form of neural network represented?

A simple form of neural network in the context of linear regression is represented by a single layer of learnable parameters. It corresponds to the linear regression model.

$$
y = X\beta + \varepsilon
$$

where:
- $y$ is the dependent variable,
- $X$ is the matrix of input features,
- $\beta$ is the vector of regression coefficients (learnable parameters),
- $\varepsilon$ is the error term.

These structures are analogous to input layers ($X$) and output layers ($y$) in a single-layer neural network.

## In neural network terminology, what is the analogy of learnable parameters used in linear regression?

In neural network terminology, the learnable parameters in linear regression, often referred to as coefficients $\beta$, are analogous to the weights in the neural network.

$$
y = X\mathbf{W} + \varepsilon
$$

where:
- $\mathbf{W}$ denotes the weights,
- $X$ is the input data,
- $y$ is the output,
- $\varepsilon$ is the error term.

## Explain the framework of linear regression as it relates to polynomial curve fitting.

The framework of linear regression in the context of polynomial curve fitting involves fitting a polynomial to a set of data points by finding the polynomial coefficients that minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values. The linear regression equation becomes:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 + \ldots + \beta_n x^n + \varepsilon
$$

where:
- $y$ is the dependent variable.
- $x$ is the independent variable.
- $\beta_i$ are the coefficients (learnable parameters).
- $\varepsilon$ is the error term.

By extending linear regression to polynomial terms, we effectively perform polynomial curve fitting.

## What is the primary limitation of single-layer neural networks?

The primary limitation of single-layer neural networks (or single-layer perceptrons) is their limited practical applicability. They can only model linear relationships and are unable to capture complex patterns or non-linear relationships in the data.

- Single-layer networks consist of an input layer and an output layer with a linear activation function, therefore limiting their representational capacity.

- #machine-learning, #neural-networks.limitations, #single-layer

## Why are single-layer networks used despite their limited practical applicability?

Single-layer networks are used because they have simple analytical properties and serve as an excellent framework for introducing core concepts in machine learning and neural networks. They lay a foundation that is essential for understanding more complex structures in deep neural networks.

- Their simplicity aids in understanding concepts such as learnable parameters, loss functions, and gradient descent, which are fundamental in more advanced networks.

- #machine-learning, #neural-networks.foundations, #single-layer

## How does the simple analytical property of single-layer networks help in understanding deeper neural network structures?

The simple analytical properties of single-layer networks help in understanding deeper neural network structures by introducing core concepts such as:

1. Learnable parameters (weights and biases).
2. Loss functions to measure prediction error.
3. Optimization techniques like gradient descent for parameter updates.

These foundational concepts are critical when dealing with the more complex architectures and behaviors of deep neural networks. For example, the idea of updating weights using gradients is identical in both single-layer and deep networks, albeit with more layers and parameters in the latter.

## What is the predictive distribution for a regression problem where both $\mathbf{w}$ and $\sigma^{2}$ are learned from data using maximum likelihood?

The predictive distribution for a regression problem where both $\mathbf{w}$ and $\sigma^{2}$ are learned from data using maximum likelihood is given by:

$$
p\left(t \mid \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ML}}, \sigma_{\mathrm{ML}}^{2}\right)=\mathcal{N}\left(t \mid y\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ML}}\right), \sigma_{\mathrm{ML}}^{2}\right)
$$

Here, $y\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}\right)$ represents the mean, which is dependent on $\mathbf{x}$ and the learned parameters $\mathbf{w}$. The variance $\sigma_{\mathrm{ML}}^{2}$ is also learned from the data.

- #machine-learning, #regression.predictive-distribution, #maximum-likelihood

---

## Explain the intuition behind using $f(\mathbf{x})=y\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ML}}\right)$ as a prediction and when it may be appropriate.

The intuition behind using $f(\mathbf{x})=y\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ML}}\right)$ for prediction stems from the idea of predicting the mean of the conditional distribution $p(t \mid \mathbf{x})$. For many practical applications, predicting the average or expected value makes sense. This method is particularly useful when the loss function is quadratic, as the mean minimizes the expected squared loss.

However, while this intuition may be accurate for certain scenarios, it can lead to poor results in situations where the underlying assumptions do not hold, such as in the presence of skewed distributions or when using different loss functions. Decision theory helps to determine when mean predictions are appropriate and under what assumptions.

- #machine-learning, #prediction.intuition, #decision-theory

---

## Describe the two-stage process involved in decision theory for making predictions based on the predictive distribution.

The two-stage process in decision theory for making predictions involves:

1. **Inference Stage**: In this stage, we use the training data to determine a predictive distribution $p(t \mid \mathbf{x})$. This involves finding the form of the distribution that best models the data.

2. **Decision Stage**: In this stage, we use the predictive distribution obtained in the inference stage to determine a specific value $f(\mathbf{x})$. This value is chosen to minimize a loss function $L(t, f(\mathbf{x}))$, which depends on both the predictive distribution and the specific value chosen. The loss function reflects the penalty or cost for the discrepancy between the predicted and true values.

- #machine-learning, #decision-theory.steps, #prediction

---

## How does the solution to the regression problem decouple between different target variables $t_k$?

The solution to the regression problem decouples between different target variables $t_{k}$ by treating each target variable independently. Since we only need to compute a single pseudo-inverse matrix $\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\dagger}$, which is shared by all the vectors $\mathbf{w}_{k}$, the problem breaks down into $K$ independent regression problems. This decoupling occurs because the parameters $\mathbf{W}$ define only the mean of the Gaussian noise distribution, which is independent of the covariance matrix.

- #machine-learning, #regression.decomposition, #independent-target-variables

---

## In the context of decision theory, what is the expected loss and how is it minimized?

The expected loss in decision theory is the average penalty incurred by a prediction function $f(\mathbf{x})$ when the true value is $t$. It is given by:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L(t, f(\mathbf{x}))]
$$

To minimize the expected loss, we choose the prediction function $f(\mathbf{x})$ that lowers this average loss based on the predictive distribution $p(t \mid \mathbf{x})$ and the cost associated with the loss function $L(t, f(\mathbf{x}))$. This approach ensures that the prediction minimizes the long-term cost when faced with uncertainty in the true value of $t$.

---

## What role does the pseudo-inverse matrix $\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\dagger}$ play in the regression problem with general Gaussian noise distributions?

The pseudo-inverse matrix $\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\dagger}$ plays a crucial role in decoupling the regression problem between different target variables $t_{k}$. By computing this single pseudo-inverse matrix, it allows for the independent estimation of regression parameters $\mathbf{w}_{k}$ for each target variable. This means that each target is solved using its corresponding vector $\mathbf{t}_{k}$, utilizing the shared structure provided by $\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\dagger}$.

## What is the regression function $f^\star(x)$ that minimizes the expected squared loss?

The regression function $f^\star(x)$ that minimizes the expected squared loss is given by the mean of the conditional distribution $p(t \mid x)$.

$$
f^\star(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}_{t}[t \mid \mathbf{x}]
$$

This function represents the conditional average of $t$ given $\mathbf{x}$.

## Define the expected loss $\mathbb{E}[L]$ in the context of regression problems.

The expected loss $\mathbb{E}[L]$ in the context of regression problems, when using a loss function $L(t, f(\mathbf{x}))$, is defined as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L]=\iint L(t, f(\mathbf{x})) p(\mathbf{x}, t) \, d\mathbf{x} \, dt
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ and $t$ are the input and target variables, respectively, and $p(\mathbf{x}, t)$ is their joint distribution.

- #math, #probability, #loss-functions

---

## What is a common choice of loss function in regression problems, and how is the expected loss $\mathbb{E}[L]$ written using this loss function?

A common choice of loss function in regression problems is the squared loss, defined as $L(t, f(\mathbf{x}))=\{f(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2}$. The expected loss using this function can be written as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L]=\iint\{f(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \, d\mathbf{x} \, dt
$$

This function penalizes the difference between the predicted and actual target values.

---

## How do we formally minimize $\mathbb{E}[L]$ for a flexible function $f(\mathbf{x})$ using calculus of variations?

To formally minimize $\mathbb{E}[L]$ for a flexible function $f(\mathbf{x})$, we use the calculus of variations. This can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{\delta \mathbb{E}[L]}{\delta f(\mathbf{x})}= 2 \int\{f(\mathbf{x})-t\} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \, dt = 0
$$

Solving this equation results in the regression function $f^\star(\mathbf{x})$.

- #math.calculus, #regression

---

## Derive the regression function $f^\star(\mathbf{x})$ from the expected loss equation.

Starting from the expected loss equation

$$
\frac{\delta \mathbb{E}[L]}{\delta f(\mathbf{x})}= 2 \int\{f(\mathbf{x})-t\} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \, dt = 0,
$$

we solve for $f(\mathbf{x})$:

$$
f^\star(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{p(\mathbf{x})} \int t p(\mathbf{x}, t) \, dt = \int t p(t \mid \mathbf{x}) \, dt = \mathbb{E}_{t}[t \mid \mathbf{x}].
$$

This shows that $f^\star(\mathbf{x})$ is the conditional average of $t$ given $\mathbf{x}$.

- #math.calculus, #regression

---

## How is the regression function $f^\star(\mathbf{x})$ extended to multiple target variables $\mathbf{t}$?

For multiple target variables represented by the vector $\mathbf{t}$, the regression function $\mathbf{f}^\star(\mathbf{x})$ is the conditional average $\mathbb{E}_{t}[\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}]$. Thus, it can be written as:

$$
\mathbf{f}^\star(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}_{t}[\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}]
$$

This extension is applicable to situations where the output is a vector rather than a scalar.

The regression function $f^{\star}(x)$, which minimizes the expected squared loss, is given by the mean of the conditional distribution $p(t \mid x)$.

Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L]=\iint \{f(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \mathrm{d} t
$$

This function $f^{\star}(x)$ represents the expected value of $t$ given $x$, thus simplifying the probability distribution $p(t \mid x)$ to a single prediction value for practical decision-making.

%
The squared-loss function in regression is given by:

$$
L(t, f(\mathbf{x}))=\{f(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2}
$$

The expected loss can be formulated as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L]=\iint \{f(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \mathrm{d} t
$$

This should not be confused with the sum-of-squares error function which is used to set parameters during training in order to determine the conditional probability distribution $p(t \mid \mathbf{x})$. The loss function, on the other hand, governs how this distribution is utilized to arrive at a predictive function $f(\mathbf{x})$.

## Explain how the calculus of variations is used in the context of the paper and its limitations.

The calculus of variations is used to derive equation (4.37) by optimizing over all possible functions $f(\mathbf{x})$. However, in practice, any parametric model, such as those implemented using deep neural networks, is limited in the range of functions it can represent. Nevertheless, deep neural networks provide a highly flexible class of functions that can approximate any desired function to high accuracy for many practical purposes.

## Rearrange and expand the squared term $\{f(\mathbf{x}) - t\}^2$ using the conditional mean $\mathbb{E}[t \mid \mathbf{x}]$.
 
Rearranged and expanded form using the conditional mean:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \{f(\mathbf{x}) - t\}^2 = \{f(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbb{E}[t \mid \mathbf{x}] + \mathbb{E}[t \mid \mathbf{x}] - t\}^2 \\
& = \{f(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbb{E}[t \mid \mathbf{x}]\}^2 + 2\{f(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbb{E}[t \mid \mathbf{x}]\}\{\mathbb{E}[t \mid \mathbf{x}] - t\} + \{\mathbb{E}[t \mid \mathbf{x}] - t\}^2

## What does the equation for the expected loss $\mathbb{E}[L]$ look like after substituting into the loss function (4.35) and evaluating the integral over $t$?

After substituting and integrating over $t$, the expected loss $\mathbb{E}[L]$ is:

\mathbb{E}[L] = \int \{f(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbb{E}[t \mid \mathbf{x}]\}^2 p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} + \int \operatorname{var}[t \mid \mathbf{x}] p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}
$$

- #statistics.conditional-mean, #probability.loss-function

## Why does the cross term vanish in the expected loss function derivation?

The cross term vanishes because the conditional mean $\mathbb{E}[t \mid \mathbf{x}]$ is used. When performing the integral over $t$, the cross term $\int 2\{f(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbb{E}[t \mid \mathbf{x}]\}\{\mathbb{E}[t \mid \mathbf{x}] - t\} p(t \mid \mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d}t$ evaluates to zero due to the properties of expectation and variance.

## What does the Minkowski loss function generalize and what is its expectation given by?

The Minkowski loss function generalizes the squared loss. Its expectation is given by:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[L_{q}\right]=\iint|f(\mathbf{x}) - t|^{q} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \mathrm{d} t
$$

For specific values of $q$, the Minkowski loss reduces to the expected squared loss ($q=2$), conditional median loss ($q=1$), and conditional mode loss ($q \rightarrow 0$).

## Explain the Bias-Variance Trade-off in the context of linear models for regression. 

When discussing the bias-variance trade-off, it is essential to balance between model complexity and over-fitting. The trade-off is primarily about:

- Bias: Error due to overly simple models not capturing underlying patterns.
- Variance: Error due to models capturing noise in the training data.

The goal is to find an optimal balance where the model performs well on both training and unseen data.

- #statistics, #machine-learning.bias-variance-tradeoff

## What is the impact of limiting the number of basis functions in a linear regression model?

Limiting the number of basis functions in a linear regression model:

- Avoids over-fitting by reducing model complexity.
- Limits the flexibility to capture important trends in the data.

- #statistics, #machine-learning.basis-functions

## Describe the consequence of using maximum likelihood estimation in linear models for regression when dealing with limited data sets.

Using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in linear models for regression with limited data sets can lead to:

- Severe over-fitting.
- Poor generalization to new data.
This happens because MLE tends to fit the training data too closely, especially in complex models.

- #statistics, #machine-learning.maximum-likelihood

## What role does the regularization coefficient $\lambda$ play in controlling over-fitting in linear regression models?

The regularization coefficient $\lambda$:

- Controls over-fitting by penalizing large coefficients in the model.
- Helps in maintaining a balance where the model can generalize well on unseen data.

- #statistics, #machine-learning.regularization

## How can one determine a suitable value for the regularization coefficient $\lambda$?

Determining a suitable value for the regularization coefficient $\lambda$ involves:

- Using cross-validation techniques.
- Evaluating model performance over a range of $\lambda$ values.

Selecting $\lambda$ where the validation performance is optimal often provides a balanced model.

- #statistics, #machine-learning.regularization

## What is the effect of regularization on models with many parameters in the context of regression?

In regression models with many parameters, regularization:

- Controls over-fitting by adding a penalty for large parameter values.
- Ensures the model's parameters do not grow excessively, keeping the model simpler and more robust.

$$
\text{Regularization term: } \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} w_j^2

% 

#### Back

The Minkowski loss function \( L_q = |f - t|^q \) changes as follows for different values of \( q \):

- **\( q = 0.3 \):** The function forms a steep well around \( f - t = 0 \) and flattens out quickly as \( f - t \) moves away from zero.
- **\( q = 1 \):** Represents the absolute loss (linear case) forming a V shape. The gradient remains constant with the distance between prediction \( f \) and target \( t \).
- **\( q = 2 \):** Corresponds to the standard squared loss function, represented as a symmetrical parabola about \( f - t = 0 \), indicating quadratically increasing penalty with deviations from the target.
- **\( q = 10 \):** Results in a very steep and narrow well around \( f - t = 0 \), suggesting an extremely high penalty for even small deviations.

These variations illustrate how different values of \( q \) affect the loss function's sensitivity to errors and its robustness to outliers in regression models.

%

The Minkowski loss function \(L_q = |f - t|^q\) shows different behaviors for different values of \(q\):

- For \(q = 0.3\) (upper-left): The function forms a steep well around \(f - t = 0\) and flattens out quickly.
- For \(q = 1\) (upper-right): The function forms a V-shape (absolute loss), linear with respect to \(f - t\).
- For \(q = 2\) (bottom-left): The function is a symmetrical parabola centered on \(f - t = 0\) (squared loss).
- For \(q = 10\) (bottom-right): The function is very steep and narrow around \(f - t = 0\), indicating a high sensitivity to even slight deviations.

%

The choice of \(q\) in the Minkowski loss function \(L_q = |f - t|^q\) impacts the regression model's sensitivity to errors and robustness:

- Smaller \(q\) values, such as \(q = 0.3\), create a loss function that is less sensitive to large errors, making the model more robust to outliers.
- \(q = 1\) results in the absolute loss, providing a balance by penalizing errors linearly.
- \(q = 2\) results in the squared loss, which heavily penalizes larger errors.
- Larger \(q\) values, like \(q = 10\), result in extremely high penalties for even slight deviations, potentially making the model over-sensitive to small errors.

The curve has a V-like shape, characteristic of graphs of absolute value functions raised to a power less than 1, indicating that as $|f - t|$ increases, the value of $|f - t|^{0.3}$ increases at a slower rate due to the exponent being less than 1. This graph shows the effect of different values of $q$ in the Minkowski loss function on the loss curve, where a lower value of $q$ makes the loss function less sensitive to outliers compared to the squared loss (i.e., $q = 2$).

## How does the value of $q$ in the Minkowski loss function affect the sensitivity to outliers?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_39f071919089f32e7ef4g-1.jpg?height=504&width=691&top_left_y=217&top_left_x=153)

%

A lower value of $q$ in the Minkowski loss function ($L_{q} = |f - t|^{q}$) makes the loss function less sensitive to outliers. For example, when $q = 0.3$, the increase in loss value $|f - t|^{0.3}$ for large errors $|f - t|$ is slower compared to the quadratic loss function where $q = 2$. Hence, for regression tasks, using lower values of $q$ can reduce the impact of outliers on the model's performance.

What is the significance of the shape of the plot $|f-t|^q$ for $q = 0.3$ in terms of regression tasks?

%
The shape of the plot $|f-t|^q$ for $q = 0.3$ illustrates how the Minkowski loss function behaves for $q$ values less than 1. Specifically:
- The curve has a V-like shape.
- As the difference $f - t$ increases, the value of $|f-t|^{0.3}$ increases, but at a slower rate than linear.
- This makes the loss function less sensitive to outliers than the squared loss (where $q = 2$).
- The plot shows how different $q$ values affect error penalties in regression.

## Exploring Minkowski loss function behavior

Why is the Minkowski loss function with $q < 1$ considered less sensitive to outliers than the squared loss function?

%
The Minkowski loss function with $q < 1$ is less sensitive to outliers because:
- For $q = 0.3$, $|f-t|^{0.3}$ increases more slowly than linear as $(f - t)$ increases.
- This slower increase means that large errors (outliers) contribute less to the overall loss.
- In contrast, the squared loss function (with $q = 2$) increases quadratically, making it heavily penalize outliers.

%

The plot shows a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at the origin. It represents the quadratic function \((f-t)^2\), commonly known as the squared loss function used in regression problems. The horizontal axis indicates the difference between a predicted value \( f \) and the true value \( t \), while the vertical axis shows the squared loss \( L_{q} \) for \( q = 2 \).

What does the plot represent in the context of regression problems?

%

The plot represents the squared loss function $\left| f - t \right|^{2}$, where $f$ is the predicted value, and $t$ is the true value. The horizontal axis denotes the difference $f - t$, while the vertical axis shows the squared difference, consistent with the quadratic function used in many regression problems. The vertex at the origin indicates zero loss when prediction and true value match perfectly.

Why is the parameter $q = 2$ significant in the plot of $\left| f - t \right|^{q}$?

%

The parameter $q = 2$ is significant because it defines the Minkowski loss function, also known as the squared loss function in this context. For $q = 2$, the loss function $\left| f - t \right|^{q}$ takes the form of $\left( f - t \right)^{2}$, which is widely used in regression problems to measure the variance of the prediction errors.

## Analyze the given plot of $L_{q}=|f-t|^{q}$ for $q=1$.

What can be inferred about the behavior of the loss function $L_{q}=|f-t|^{q}$ when $q=1$, as shown in the plot?

%

When $q=1$, the loss function $L_{q} = |f-t|^{q}$ simplifies to $|f-t|$. The plot is a V-shaped graph with its vertex at the origin (0, 0). It extends linearly upwards in both directions, indicating that as the difference between $f$ (the prediction) and $t$ (the true value) increases, the loss increases linearly, regardless of the sign of the difference. This is characteristic of the L1 loss or absolute loss, which is used when the median is the desired measure of central tendency.

## What does the V-shaped graph signify for the loss function $L_{q}=|f-t|^{q}$ when $q=1$?

%

The V-shaped graph signifies that the loss function $L_{q} = |f-t|$ when $q=1$ increases linearly with the absolute deviation of the predictions from the true values. It indicates that the loss is directly proportional to the absolute difference between $f$ and $t$, making it appropriate for scenarios where minimizing the median of the deviations is essential.

**Describe the plot of the Minkowski loss function for \( q = 1 \).**

%

The plot of the Minkowski loss function for \( q = 1 \), labeled as \( L_q = |f - t|^1 \), shows a V-shaped graph. It simplifies to the absolute value function \( |f - t| \). The plot has its vertex at the origin (0, 0) and extends linearly upwards in both directions. This indicates that the loss increases linearly with the absolute deviation of \( f \) from \( t \), irrespective of the sign of the difference. The horizontal axis represents \( f - t \) (the difference between prediction and target), and the vertical axis represents the loss.

**What characteristic does the plot of the Minkowski loss function with \( q = 1 \) indicate?**

%

The plot of the Minkowski loss function with \( q = 1 \) reflects that the loss increases directly with the absolute deviation of the predictions from the true values. This is characteristic of the L1 loss, or absolute loss, which is often used when the median is the desired measure of central tendency. The linear nature of the loss function for \( q = 1 \) implies that it is robust to outliers.

## Describe the general shape and interpretation of the plot for $L_{q} = |f - t|^{q}$ when $q = 10$. Why is this significant for regression problems?

%

- The plot for $L_{q} = |f - t|^{q}$ with $q = 10$ has a sharp U-shaped curve.
- This U-shape signifies that the loss function increases very steeply as the prediction $f$ deviates from the target $t$.
- Such a steep curve indicates higher sensitivity to prediction errors, meaning deviations from $t$ will incur very high losses.
- This characteristic is crucial for regression problems as it indicates a strong emphasis on prediction accuracy.

Explain the behavior of the function $L_{q}=|f-t|^{q}$ when $q=10$, as shown in the plot.

%
The function $L_{q}=|f-t|^{q}$ when $q=10$ exhibits a sharp increase as $f-t$ deviates from 0. This results in a steep U-shaped curve, indicating that the loss increases very steeply with larger deviations from the target value $t$, making the loss function highly sensitive to prediction errors.

%
What does the steepness of the curve in the plot of $L_{q}=|f-t|^{q}$ for $q=10$ imply about its sensitivity to prediction errors?

%
The steepness of the curve in the plot of $L_{q}=|f-t|^{q}$ for $q=10$ implies that this Minkowski loss function is extremely sensitive to prediction errors. Predictions that are not very close to the target value $t$ will incur a very high loss, emphasizing the necessity of accurate predictions.

## Explain the optimal prediction under the squared-loss function in the context of a regression problem, given the conditional distribution $p(t \mid \mathbf{x})$.

The optimal prediction for the squared-loss function is given by the conditional expectation:

$$
h(\mathbf{x})=\mathbb{E}[t \mid \mathbf{x}]=\int t p(t \mid \mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} t
$$

This prediction minimizes the expected squared loss as $h(\mathbf{x})$ represents the average value of $t$ given the data point $\mathbf{x}$.

- #regression, #squared-loss, #optimal-prediction

## What is the expected squared loss composed of?

The expected squared loss $\mathbb{E}[L]$ can be decomposed into two main terms:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L]=\int\{f(\mathbf{x})-h(\mathbf{x})\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}+\iint\{h(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \mathrm{d} t
$$

The first term $\int\{f(\mathbf{x})-h(\mathbf{x})\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}$ depends on our choice for the function $f(\mathbf{x})$ and is the error due to the model. The second term $\iint\{h(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \mathrm{d} t$ represents the intrinsic noise of the data and is independent of $f(\mathbf{x})$.

- #regression, #expected-loss, #squared-loss

## What does the second term in the expected squared loss $\mathbb{E}[L]$ represent?

The second term in the expected squared loss 

$$
\iint\{h(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \mathrm{d} t
$$

arises from the intrinsic noise on the data and represents the minimum achievable value of the expected loss, which is independent of the choice of $f(\mathbf{x})$.

- #regression, #intrinsic-noise, #expected-loss

## Why can the first term, $\int\{f(\mathbf{x})-h(\mathbf{x})\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}$, achieve a minimum value of zero in the expected squared loss?

The first term,

$$
\int\{f(\mathbf{x})-h(\mathbf{x})\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x},
$$

can achieve a minimum value of zero because $f(\mathbf{x})$ can be made to approximate $h(\mathbf{x})$ as closely as possible given an unlimited supply of data and computational resources. This would represent the optimal choice for $f(\mathbf{x})$.

## How does a frequentist approach handle model uncertainty compared to a Bayesian perspective?

In a frequentist approach, model uncertainty is handled through a point estimate of the parameter vector $\mathbf{w}$ based on the data set $\mathcal{D}$. This is in contrast to a Bayesian perspective, where uncertainty is expressed through a posterior distribution over $\mathbf{w}$. The frequentist approach assesses the performance by averaging over an ensemble of data sets drawn from the distribution $p(t, \mathbf{x})$.

- #frequentist, #Bayesian, #model-uncertainty

## Explain the bias-variance trade-off in the context of frequentist viewpoint and why it's important in regression models.

The bias-variance trade-off addresses the problem of balancing model complexity and prediction accuracy. High bias (underfitting) happens when the model is too simple to capture the data patterns, leading to poor prediction on training and unseen data. High variance (overfitting) occurs when the model is too complex, capturing noise along with the underlying pattern, leading to poor generalization. This trade-off is crucial because it guides the choice of model complexity and regularization, aiming for a good equilibrium to minimize the expected prediction error.

## What is the first step in decomposing the expression $\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}\left[\{f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})-h(\mathbf{x})\}^{2}\right]$?

By adding and subtracting $\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})]$ inside the braces and then expanding the expression, the decomposition starts as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left\{f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})-\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})]+\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})]-h(\mathbf{x})\right\}^{2} \\
& =\left\{f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})-\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})]\right\}^{2}+\left\{\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})]-h(\mathbf{x})\right\}^{2} \\
& +2\left\{f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})-\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})]\right\}\left\{\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})]-h(\mathbf{x})\right\}

The term $2\left\{f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})-\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})]\right\}\left\{\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})]-h(\mathbf{x})\right\}$ vanishes when taking the expectation with respect to $\mathcal{D}$ because it equals zero. This is due to the fact that $\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}\left[f(\mathbf{x};\mathcal{D})-\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x};\mathcal{D})]\right] = 0$.

## What results from the decomposition of the expected squared difference $\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}\left[\{f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})-h(\mathbf{x})\}^{2}\right]$?

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}\left[\{f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})-h(\mathbf{x})\}^{2}\right] &= \underbrace{\left\{\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})]-h(\mathbf{x})\right\}^{2}}_{(\text {bias })^{2}} \\
&+ \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}\left[\left\{f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})-\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})]\right\}^{2}\right]}_{\text {variance }}

## How is the expected loss expressed in terms of bias, variance, and noise?

The expected loss can be decomposed into the bias squared, variance, and noise:

$$
\text{expected loss} = (\text{bias})^{2} + \text{variance} + \text{noise}
$$

where

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\text{bias})^2 &= \int \left\{ \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x}; \mathcal{D})] - h(\mathbf{x}) \right\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}) \,d\mathbf{x} \\
\text{variance} &= \int \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}\left[\left\{f(\mathbf{x}; \mathcal{D}) - \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x}; \mathcal{D})] \right\}^{2}\right] p(\mathbf{x}) \,d\mathbf{x} \\

## What is the goal when dealing with the bias-variance trade-off in models?

The goal is to minimize the expected loss, balancing between bias and variance. Flexible models tend to have low bias but high variance, while rigid models have high bias but low variance. The optimal model achieves the best trade-off between these two:

$$
\text{expected loss} = (\text{bias})^{2} + \text{variance} + \text{noise}

## Explain what the variance measures in the decomposition of the expected squared difference between $f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})$ and $h(\mathbf{x})$.

The variance measures the extent to which the predictions for individual data sets deviate from their average prediction. Specifically,

$$
\text{variance} = \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}\left[\left\{f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D}) - \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[f(\mathbf{x} ; \mathcal{D})]\right\}^{2}\right]

## Describe the sinuisoidal function used to generate the data points.

## What is the formula for estimating the average prediction, and explain its components.

The average prediction $\bar{f}(x)$ is estimated by:

$$
\bar{f}(x)=\frac{1}{L} \sum_{l=1}^{L} f^{(l)}(x)
$$

- Here, $L$ is the number of data sets, and $f^{(l)}(x)$ is the prediction function for the $l$-th data set. The formula averages the predictions over the $L$ different models.
- #machine-learning, #bias-variance

## Provide the equations for integrated squared bias and integrated variance and explain each term.

The integrated squared bias and integrated variance are given by:

$$

(\text {bias})^{2} & =\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{\bar{f}\left(x_{n}\right)-h\left(x_{n}\right)\right\}^{2} \\
\text {variance} & =\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{L} \sum_{l=1}^{L}\left\{f^{(l)}\left(x_{n}\right)-\bar{f}\left(x_{n}\right)\right\}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

- $N$ is the number of data points, $L$ is the number of data sets, $\bar{f}(x_n)$ is the average prediction, and $h(x_n)$ is the true function. The bias term quantifies the difference between the average prediction and the true function, while the variance term quantifies the variability of predictions around their average.
- #machine-learning, #bias-variance 

## Explain why averaging many solutions for a complex model with $M=25$ parameters might be beneficial.

Averaging many solutions for a complex model with $M=25$ parameters can be beneficial as it tends to provide a very good fit to the regression function $h(x)$ by reducing overfitting and leveraging the strengths of multiple models. This ensemble approach is aligned with Bayesian methods that average with respect to the posterior distribution of parameters.
  
- #machine-learning, #ensemble-methods

## What impact does a large regularization coefficient $\lambda$ have on the bias and variance in a model?

A large value of the regularization coefficient $\lambda$ results in low variance and high bias. This occurs because the regularization tends to shrink the model parameters, making all models look similar (low variance) but potentially far from the true function (high bias).

- #machine-learning, #regularization 

## Discuss the practical limitations of the bias-variance decomposition.

The bias-variance decomposition, although useful for providing insights into model complexity, is of limited practical value because it relies on averages with respect to ensembles of data sets. In practice, we often only have a single observed data set. If we had multiple independent training sets, combining them into a larger set would be more effective in reducing overfitting.

## Define the regularization parameter $\lambda$ and its role in model complexity.

The regularization parameter $\lambda$ is used to control the complexity of a model. In the context of Figure 4.7, it's observed that the value of $\lambda$ affects the bias and variance of the fitted model. For large $\lambda$, the model is overly simple, leading to high bias and low variance; for small $\lambda$, the model is overly complex, resulting in low bias and high variance.

## For understanding bias and variance trade-offs, why is it important to consider multiple data sets?

Considering multiple data sets ($L=100$ in this case) helps in observing the variability of the model's performance and provides a better understanding of the bias-variance trade-off. Averaging over multiple fits offers insight into the expected bias and variance for different regularization parameters $\lambda$.

In regression models:

- **Large $\lambda$ (e.g., $\ln \lambda = 3$)**: Results in low variance but high bias. The model fits are similar but deviate from the actual function.
- **Moderate $\lambda$ (e.g., $\ln \lambda = 1$)**: Strikes a balance between variance and bias. The model fits show moderate variability and better approximation of the actual function.
- **Small $\lambda$ (e.g., $\ln \lambda = -3$)**: Leads to low bias but high variance. The model fits closely follow the actual function but exhibit substantial differences between each fit, indicating overfitting.

%

The average fit (red curve in the right plots) represents the mean response of the model across multiple data sets. Its closeness to the original sinusoidal function (green curve) indicates the overall performance of the model:

- For **large $\lambda$** (top row), the average fit diverges significantly from the sinusoidal function, indicating high bias.
- For **moderate $\lambda$** (middle row), the average fit approximates the sinusoidal function more closely, balancing bias and variance.
- For **small $\lambda$** (bottom row), the average fit follows the sinusoidal function closely, indicating low bias but higher variance and potential overfitting to noise.

For a high regularization parameter ($\ln \lambda = 3$), the resulting model fits have low variance, as evidenced by the similarity of the red curves in the left plot.

With a low regularization parameter ($\ln \lambda = -3$), the model exhibits high variance, shown by the substantial differences between each red curve in the left plot. Although this results in low bias, as the average model fit (right plot's red curve) closely follows the sinusoidal function, the model is prone to overfitting to noise within individual data sets.

To minimize the error function, we take the partial derivative with respect to each $w_i$ and set it to zero:

$$
\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_i} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( y_n - \sum_{j=0}^{M} w_j x_n^j \right) (- x_n^i) = 0
$$

By arranging terms, we obtain the set of linear equations

$$
\sum_{j=0}^{M} \left( \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_n^{i+j} \right) w_j = \sum_{n=1}^{N} y_n x_n^i
$$

Identifying $A_{ij} = \sum_{n=1}^N x_n^{i+j}$ and $T_i = \sum_{n=1}^N y_n x_n^i$, we get:

$$
\sum_{j=0}^{M} A_{i j} w_{j}=T_{i}

## Write down the set of coupled linear equations, analogous to (4.53), satisfied by the coefficients $w_{i}$ that minimize the regularized sum-of-squares error function given by (1.4).

## The regularized sum-of-squares error function is defined as:

$$
E(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( y_n - y(x_n, \mathbf{w}) \right)^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{j=0}^{M} w_j^2
$$

To minimize, we need to take the partial derivative with respect to each $w_i$ and set it to zero:

$$
\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_i} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( y_n - \sum_{j=0}^{M} w_j x_n^j \right) (- x_n^i) + \lambda w_i = 0
$$

Rearranging terms, we get the set of linear equations:

$$
\sum_{j=0}^{M} \left( \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_n^{i+j} + \lambda \delta_{ij} \right) w_j = \sum_{n=1}^{N} y_n x_n^i
$$

where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta function.

## Show that the tanh function defined by

$$
\tanh(a) = \frac{e^a - e^{-a}}{e^a + e^{-a}}
$$

is related to the logistic sigmoid function by 

$$
\tanh(a) = 2 \sigma(2a) - 1
$$

## The logistic sigmoid function is given by

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}
$$

First, note that:

$$
\sigma(2a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-2a}}
$$

Multiply numerator and denominator by $e^a$:

$$
\sigma(2a) = \frac{e^a}{e^a + e^{-a}}
$$

Rewriting $\tanh(a)$ gives:

$$
\tanh(a) = \frac{e^a - e^{-a}}{e^a + e^{-a}}
$$

Express $\tanh(a)$ in terms of $\sigma(2a)$:

$$
\tanh(a) = 2\left( \frac{e^a}{e^a + e^{-a}} \right) - 1 = 2\sigma(2a) - 1
$$

## Show that a general linear combination of logistic sigmoid functions of the form

$$
y(x, \mathbf{w}) = w_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{M} w_j \sigma \left( \frac{x - \mu_j}{s} \right)
$$

is a valid function.

## Given the logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ defined as:

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}
$$

and the general linear combination as:

$$
y(x, \mathbf{w}) = w_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{M} w_j \sigma \left( \frac{x - \mu_j}{s} \right)
$$

To demonstrate validity, use properties of linear combinations and logistic sigmoid functions. Each $\sigma \left( \frac{x - \mu_j}{s} \right)$ is bounded between 0 and 1.

By linearly combining these bounded functions, $y(x, \mathbf{w})$ remains continuous and well-defined, inheriting the smoothness and boundedness properties of the sigmoid function.

## Explain the significance of the minimum value of $(\text{bias})^2 + \text{variance}$ occurring around $\ln \lambda = 0.43$

## In the context of model bias-variance tradeoff:

- **Bias**: Error due to the model’s assumptions.
- **Variance**: Error due to model’s sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set.

The minimum value of $(\text{bias})^2 + \text{variance}$ indicates optimal regularization parameter $\lambda$. Around $\ln \lambda = 0.43$, the model balances underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance), as confirmed by minimized test error.

## The average test set error assesses the model's generalization performance:

$$

At $\ln \lambda = 0.43$, the sum of squared bias and variance is minimized, leading to the lowest test set error. This value of $\lambda$ reflects the optimal complexity level of the model, achieving the best balance between bias and variance for generalization to unseen data.

## Describe the linear regression model in terms of a neural network diagram. Include reference to the basis functions and parameters.

The linear regression model can be expressed as a simple neural network diagram involving a single layer of parameters. Each basis function $\phi_{j}(\mathbf{x})$ is represented by an input node, with the solid node representing the 'bias' basis function $\phi_{0}$. The function $y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w})$ is represented by an output node. Each of the parameters $w_{j}$ is shown by a line connecting the corresponding basis function to the output.

#machine-learning, #linear-regression.model

## Explain why deep learning uses learned transformations instead of fixed basis functions, as practiced before deep learning.

Before deep learning, machine learning often used fixed pre-processing of input variables $\mathbf{x}$ through a set of basis functions $\left\{\phi_{j}(\mathbf{x})\right\}$, which is also known as feature extraction. The goal was to have a sufficiently powerful set of basis functions so that the learning task could be solved using a simple network model. However, handcrafting suitable basis functions was difficult for anything but the simplest applications. Deep learning avoids this by learning the required nonlinear transformations of the data directly from the data set.

## How can the polynomial function from Chapter 1 be expressed as a linear regression model? Include the relevant equations and explanation.

The polynomial function from Chapter 1 can be expressed in the form of a linear regression model (4.3) by considering a single input variable $x$ and choosing basis functions defined by $\phi_{j}(x)=x^{j}$. In this case, the form of the model is:

$$
y(x, \mathbf{w}) = \sum_{j=0}^{M} w_j \phi_j(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{M} w_j x^j
$$

where $M$ is the degree of the polynomial and $w_j$ are the learnable parameters.

## What are Gaussian basis functions and how are they parameterized? Provide the relevant equations.

Gaussian basis functions are defined as:

$$
\phi_{j}(x)=\exp \left\{-\frac{\left(x-\mu_{j}\right)^{2}}{2 s^{2}}\right\}
$$

In this equation, $\mu_{j}$ governs the locations of the basis functions in input space, and the parameter $s$ governs their spatial scale. These basis functions do not need a probabilistic interpretation as their normalization coefficient is unimportant since they are multiplied by learnable parameters $w_{j}$.

## Define the sigmoidal basis function and the logistic sigmoid function. Explain their relationship with the tanh function.

The sigmoidal basis function is of the form:

$$
\phi_{j}(x)=\sigma\left(\frac{x-\mu_{j}}{s}\right)
$$

where $\sigma(a)$ is the logistic sigmoid function defined by:

$$
\sigma(a)=\frac{1}{1+\exp (-a)}
$$

The tanh function is related to the logistic sigmoid by:

$$
\tanh (a)=2 \sigma(2 a)-1
$$

This means a general linear combination of logistic sigmoid functions is equivalent to a general linear combination of tanh functions in representing the same class of input-output functions.

## Explain the importance of basis functions in regression models and their evolution with the advent of deep learning.

Basis functions in regression models serve to transform the input variables into a space where a linear combination of the basis functions can effectively model the target function. Traditional models relied on predefined sets of basis functions, which required domain expertise and significant effort to craft. With the advent of deep learning, the need for predefined basis functions decreased as neural networks can learn suitable non-linear transformations from data, thus automating and improving the feature extraction process.

In the linear regression model, the bias basis function $\phi_0(\mathbf{x})$ is significant because it accounts for the constant term in the linear equation.

## What is the form of the Gaussian basis functions and can you derive its structure?

A Gaussian basis function is typically expressed in the form:

$$
\phi_j(x) = \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu_j)^2}{2s^2}\right)
$$

where $\mu_j$ and $s$ are parameters that control the center and width of the basis function, respectively. To derive the structure, we start with the general form of a Gaussian function centered at $\mu_j$:

$$
\mathcal{N}(x|\mu_j, s^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi s^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu_j)^2}{2s^2}\right)
$$

However, since we are dealing with basis functions, we can ignore the normalizing factor because it is typically accounted for elsewhere in the model. Thus, we obtain the simplified form:

$$
\phi_j(x) = \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu_j)^2}{2s^2}\right)
$$

where $\phi_j(x)$ represents the value of the $j$-th basis function evaluated at input $x$.

## What are the sigmoidal basis functions and their general equation as mentioned in the document?

The general form of a sigmoidal basis function is defined as follows:

$$\phi_j(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a(x - \mu_j))}$$

Where $a$ and $\mu_j$ are parameters. $\mu_j$ controls the position of the sigmoid along the x-axis and $a$ controls the slope of the sigmoid.

## Interpret the basis function expansion mentioned in the document in the context of Fourier basis.

A Fourier basis function leads to an expansion in sinusoidal functions, typically represented as:

$$
\psi_k(x) = \cos(kx) \quad \text{and} \quad \psi_k(x) = \sin(kx)
$$

where $k$ denotes the frequency of the sinusoid. Each basis function represents a specific frequency and has infinite spatial extent. Fourier basis functions are particularly useful in signal processing due to their ability to represent periodic components.

## Explain the assumption of the target variable $t$ with the additive Gaussian noise model in the context of this chapter.

The target variable $t$ is given by a function $y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w})$ with additive Gaussian noise $\epsilon$. This can be expressed as:

$$
t = y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) + \epsilon
$$

where $\epsilon$ is a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with variance $\sigma^{2}$. Therefore, the probability density function for $t$ given $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{w}$, and $\sigma^{2}$ is:

$$
p(t| \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}, \sigma^{2}) = \mathcal{N}(t| y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}), \sigma^{2})
$$

This Gaussian noise model underlies many fitting and estimation techniques, such as the least-squares approach.

- #statistics.likelihood, #mathematics.gaussian

## Why are wavelets significant in terms of basis functions as discussed in Section 4.1.7?

Wavelets are significant in basis functions because they are localized in both space and frequency. This dual localization makes them extremely useful in signal processing applications where inputs often reside on a regular lattice (e.g., time series, images). The orthogonality of wavelets simplifies their application and analysis:

Wavelets possess the following properties:
- Localized in both time (or space) and frequency.
- Mutually orthogonal.
- Useful for analyzing and representing data with localized features.

This dual peaking property allows for efficient representation and analysis of signals that have localized changes, such as sudden spikes or edges.

## Describe the relationship between the least-squares approach and maximum likelihood estimation as given in the provided document.

In the document, the least-squares approach and maximum likelihood estimation are related under the assumption of Gaussian noise. Minimizing the sum-of-squares error function is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of the observed data under a Gaussian noise model.

The error function can be represented as:

$$
E(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (t_n - y(\mathbf{x}_n, \mathbf{w}))^2
$$

Assuming $t = y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$, the likelihood function $p(\mathbf{t}|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{w}, \sigma^2)$ is Gaussian:

$$
p(\mathbf{t}|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{w}, \sigma^2) = \prod_{n=1}^{N} \mathcal{N}(t_n | y(\mathbf{x}_n, \mathbf{w}), \sigma^2)
$$

Maximizing this likelihood function corresponds to minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which is proportional to the sum-of-squares error function.

The gradient of the log-likelihood function with respect to $\mathbf{w}$ is:

$$
\nabla_{\mathbf{w}} \ln p\left(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{w}, \sigma^{2}\right)=\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{t_{n}-\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}\right)\right\} \boldsymbol{\phi}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

## How do you determine the parameter $\mathbf{w}$ that maximizes the likelihood function?

Setting the gradient to zero gives:

$$
0=\sum_{n=1}^{N} t_{n} \boldsymbol{\phi}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}-\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}}\left(\sum_{n=1}^{N} \boldsymbol{\phi}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}\right) \boldsymbol{\phi}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}\right)

## Why are the first two terms in $\ln p\left(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{w}, \sigma^{2}\right)$ treated as constants when determining $\mathbf{w}$?

The first two terms in

$$
\ln p\left(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{w}, \sigma^{2}\right) = -\frac{N}{2} \ln \sigma^{2} - \frac{N}{2} \ln (2 \pi) - \frac{1}{\sigma^{2}} E_{D}(\mathbf{w})

The Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ is given by:

$$
\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\dagger} \equiv\left(\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\Phi}\right)^{-1} \boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

It acts as a generalization of the matrix inverse for non-square matrices. For square and invertible matrices, it simplifies as $\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\dagger} = \boldsymbol{\Phi}^{-1}$.

## Derive the value of $w_{0}$ by setting the derivative of $E_D(\mathbf{w})$ with respect to $w_{0}$ equal to zero.

The error function is given by:

$$

$$

Setting its derivative wrt \(w_0\) to zero:

\[
\frac{\partial E_D(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_0} = -\sum_{n=1}^N (t_n - w_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{M-1} w_j \phi_j(\mathbf{x}_n)) = 0

$$

This represents the variance of the target values around the regression fit.

### Card 1

## What is the least-squares regression function and how is it geometrically interpreted in the context of the given $N$-dimensional space?

The least-squares regression function is obtained by finding the orthogonal projection of the data vector $\mathbf{t}$ onto the subspace spanned by the basis functions $\phi_{j}(\mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, this means that the solution $\mathbf{y}$ lies in the $M$-dimensional subspace that is closest to $\mathbf{t}$. The sum-of-squares error $E(\mathbf{w})$ is minimized by this projection, and this can be expressed as:

$$
E(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{2} ||\mathbf{t} - \boldsymbol{\Phi} \mathbf{w}||^2
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ is the design matrix formed by basis functions evaluated at data points.

### Card 2

## How can numerical difficulties arise in solving the normal equations directly when using least-squares solutions, and how can these difficulties be mitigated?

Numerical difficulties can arise when $\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\Phi}$ is close to singular, especially if two or more basis vectors $\varphi_{j}$ are co-linear, resulting in parameter values with large magnitudes. Such issues can be mitigated using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to address near degeneracies. The addition of a regularization term ensures the matrix remains non-singular in the presence of these degeneracies.

The vector $\mathbf{y}$ in the context of least-squares regression is defined as an $N$-dimensional vector whose $n$th element is given by $y\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}, \mathbf{w}\right)$, where $n=1, \ldots, N$. Because $\mathbf{y}$ is an arbitrary linear combination of the vectors $\varphi_{j}$, it can reside anywhere in the $M$-dimensional subspace spanned by the basis functions $\phi_{j}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}\right)$.

In the least-squares solution, the orthogonal projection of the data vector $\mathbf{t}$ onto the subspace spanned by the basis functions $\phi_{j}(\mathbf{x})$ signifies that the solution $\mathbf{y}$ lies within the subspace and is closest to $\mathbf{t}$. This minimizes the sum-of-squares error, which is associated with the squared Euclidean distance between $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{t}$.

## Describe the advantage of sequential learning methods over batch methods in the context of large datasets.

Sequential learning methods, also known as online algorithms, process data points one at a time and update model parameters after each presentation. This is advantageous over batch methods, which require processing the entire training set at once, making sequential methods more computationally efficient for large datasets and suitable for real-time applications where data arrives continuously.

## Explain the update rule in stochastic gradient descent.

The basis of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is to update the parameter vector $\mathbf{w}$ based on each data point individually, rather than using the full dataset. After the presentation of data point $n$, the update rule is given by:

$$
\mathbf{w}^{(\tau+1)}=\mathbf{w}^{(\tau)}-\eta \nabla E_{n}
$$

where:
- $\tau$ denotes the iteration number
- $\eta$ is the learning rate
- $\nabla E_{n}$ is the gradient of the error with respect to data point $n$

In this way, the parameter vector $\mathbf{w}$ is iteratively refined towards minimizing the error function $E=\sum_{n} E_{n}$.

- #optimization, #stochastic-gradient-descent.error-function

## Describe the least-mean-squares (LMS) algorithm and its update rule for sum-of-squares error function.

For the sum-of-squares error function, the update rule for the least-mean-squares (LMS) algorithm can be expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{w}^{(\tau+1)}=\mathbf{w}^{(\tau)}+\eta\left(t_{n}-\mathbf{w}^{(\tau) \mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}_{n}\right) \boldsymbol{\phi}_{n}
$$

where:
- $\phi_{n}=\phi\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}\right)$ represents the feature vector associated with the $n$-th data point.
- $t_{n}$ is the target value of data point $n$.
- $\eta$ is the learning rate.

This algorithm is used to iteratively adjust $\mathbf{w}$ to minimize the sum-of-squares error.

## How does regularized least squares help in controlling over-fitting?

Regularized least squares adds a regularization term to the error function, balancing between the data-fit and the model complexity:

$$
E_{D}(\mathbf{w})+\lambda E_{W}(\mathbf{w})
$$

where:
- $E_{D}(\mathbf{w})$ is the error term based on data.
- $E_{W}(\mathbf{w})$ is the regularization term.
- $\lambda$ is a coefficient controlling the trade-off.

This makes the total error function to be minimized as:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{t_{n}-\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}\right)\right\}^{2}+\frac{\lambda}{2} \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{w}
$$

Regularization shrinks the model parameter values, reducing overfitting by simplifying the model.

- #machine-learning, #regularization.over-fitting

## Write down the regularization term $E_{W}(\mathbf{w})$ for the weight vector elements and describe its role.

The regularization term $E_{W}(\mathbf{w})$ is given by:

$$
E_{W}(\mathbf{w})=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{j} w_{j}^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{w}
$$

This term penalizes large values of the weight vector elements $\mathbf{w}$, encouraging smaller parameter values and reducing the risk of overfitting by controlling model complexity.

- #regularization, #machine-learning.weight-decay

## Derive the closed-form solution of $\mathbf{w}$ for the regularized least squares problem.

Given the total error function that includes regularization:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{t_{n}-\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}\right)\right\}^{2}+\frac{\lambda}{2} \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{w}
$$

The exact minimizer can be found by setting the gradient to zero and solving for $\mathbf{w}$:

$$
\mathbf{w}=\left(\lambda \mathbf{I}+\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\Phi}\right)^{-1} \boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{t}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ is the design matrix composed of feature vectors $\phi(\mathbf{x}_{n})$.

## Describe what is meant by parameter shrinkage in the context of regularization.

Parameter shrinkage refers to the effect of regularization in minimizing the surplus parameter values, effectively shrinking them towards zero. This technique:

- Reduces model complexity by penalizing large weights.
- Improves generalization by making the model simpler and reducing overfitting risks.

One example is the regularizer:

$$
E_{W}(\mathbf{w})=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{j} w_{j}^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{w}
$$

$$
\ln p\left( \mathbf{T} \mid \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{W}, \sigma^2 \right) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \ln \mathcal{N}\left( \mathbf{t}_n \mid \mathbf{W}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}\left( \mathbf{x}_n \right), \sigma^2 \mathbf{I} \right)

Expanding it, we get:

$$
-\frac{N K}{2} \ln \left( 2 \pi \sigma^2 \right) - \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left\| \mathbf{t}_n - \mathbf{W}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}\left( \mathbf{x}_n \right) \right\|^2

Explain the representation of a linear regression model as a neural network as shown in this image, particularly focusing on its structure and components.

%

The image depicts a linear regression model represented as a neural network with a single layer of connections. It comprises:

1. **Nodes:** Each node represents a basis function $\phi_i(x)$, where $\phi_0(x)$ is a solid node indicating the bias function.
2. **Connections:** Links between nodes symbolizing the weights $w_{ij}$ and biases for the model.
3. **Output Nodes:** Labeled $y_1(x, w), \ldots, y_K(x, w)$, representing the multiple predicted target variables.

The top layer nodes $y_1$ through $y_K$ correspond to outputs determined by the weighted sum of the basis functions $\phi_1(x)$ to $\phi_{M-1}(x)$. This network structure extends the linear regression model to scenarios with multiple output predictions.

Describe how the concept of basis functions and target vectors can be extended to predict multiple outputs in a linear regression model, referencing the image.

%

To predict multiple outputs $K>1$ in a linear regression model, as depicted in the image:

1. **Basis Functions:** Multiple sets of basis functions $\phi_i(x)$ are introduced for each component of the target vector $\mathbf{t}$.
2. **Target Vector:** Denoted as $\mathbf{t}=\left(t_1, \ldots, t_K\right)^{\mathrm{T}}$, containing multiple target variables.
3. **Independent Regression Problems:** Each target variable $t_k$ can be treated as a separate, independent regression problem, leveraging distinct basis functions for each.

This approach transforms the linear regression model into a structure that can handle vector targets, predicting multiple outputs via the weighted sums of the corresponding basis functions.

%

**A:**

In the linear regression model representation, the bias node is denoted as $\phi_0(x)$ and is depicted by a solid node at the bottom of the diagram.

%

**A:**

In the linear regression model represented as a neural network, multiple target variables are handled by having separate output nodes for each target variable. These nodes are labeled $y_1(x, w)$ to $y_K(x, w)$. Each output node corresponds to a different predicted output, determined by a distinct weighted sum of the transformed input features through the basis functions. This approach allows the model to predict multiple outputs ($K > 1$), effectively solving multiple independent regression problems simultaneously.
