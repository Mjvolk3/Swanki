The Minkowski loss function \(L_q = |f - t|^q\) shows different behaviors for different values of \(q\):

- For \(q = 0.3\) (upper-left): The function forms a steep well around \(f - t = 0\) and flattens out quickly.
- For \(q = 1\) (upper-right): The function forms a V-shape (absolute loss), linear with respect to \(f - t\).
- For \(q = 2\) (bottom-left): The function is a symmetrical parabola centered on \(f - t = 0\) (squared loss).
- For \(q = 10\) (bottom-right): The function is very steep and narrow around \(f - t = 0\), indicating a high sensitivity to even slight deviations.

## What implications do different values of \(q\) in the Minkowski loss function have on regression models?

The choice of \(q\) in the Minkowski loss function \(L_q = |f - t|^q\) impacts the regression model's sensitivity to errors and robustness:

- Smaller \(q\) values, such as \(q = 0.3\), create a loss function that is less sensitive to large errors, making the model more robust to outliers.
- \(q = 1\) results in the absolute loss, providing a balance by penalizing errors linearly.
- \(q = 2\) results in the squared loss, which heavily penalizes larger errors.
- Larger \(q\) values, like \(q = 10\), result in extremely high penalties for even slight deviations, potentially making the model over-sensitive to small errors.
