Explain the significance of the bias basis function $\phi_0$ in the linear regression model shown in the neural network diagram.

%

In the linear regression model, the bias basis function $\phi_0(\mathbf{x})$ is significant because it accounts for the constant term in the linear equation. It is often set to a constant value of 1 to allow the model to fit the data better by adjusting the offset of the output. This inclusion helps in providing more flexibility to the model, ensuring it can capture patterns that do not pass through the origin.

Describe how the linear regression model can be represented as a simple neural network involving a single layer of parameters.

%

The linear regression model can be represented as a simple neural network with a single layer of parameters by treating each basis function $\phi_{j}(\mathbf{x})$ as an input node and the function $y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w})$ as the output node. The parameters $w_{j}$, corresponding to each basis function, are shown as lines connecting the input nodes to the output node. The network effectively sums the weighted basis functions, represented by the equation $y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) = \sum_{j=0}^{M-1} w_{j} \phi_{j}(\mathbf{x})$, illustrating the linear combination used for prediction.
