The minimum point around \( \ln \lambda = 0.43 \) represents the value at which the sum of squared bias and variance is minimized. This value is significant because it indicates the optimal balance between bias and variance, which minimizes the generalization error of the model. Achieving this balance is crucial for ensuring that the model performs well on unseen data.

Describe the behavior of bias and variance as the regularization parameter \( \lambda \) increases, based on the plot below.

As the regularization parameter \( \lambda \) increases:

- Bias tends to increase.
- Variance tends to decrease.

This behavior is typical in predictive modeling where low values of \( \lambda \) can lead to overfitting (low bias, high variance), and high values of \( \lambda \) can lead to underfitting (high bias, low variance).
