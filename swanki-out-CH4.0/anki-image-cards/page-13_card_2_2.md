What is the significance of the shape of the plot $|f-t|^q$ for $q = 0.3$ in terms of regression tasks?

%
The shape of the plot $|f-t|^q$ for $q = 0.3$ illustrates how the Minkowski loss function behaves for $q$ values less than 1. Specifically:
- The curve has a V-like shape.
- As the difference $f - t$ increases, the value of $|f-t|^{0.3}$ increases, but at a slower rate than linear.
- This makes the loss function less sensitive to outliers than the squared loss (where $q = 2$).
- The plot shows how different $q$ values affect error penalties in regression.

## Exploring Minkowski loss function behavior

Why is the Minkowski loss function with $q < 1$ considered less sensitive to outliers than the squared loss function?

%
The Minkowski loss function with $q < 1$ is less sensitive to outliers because:
- For $q = 0.3$, $|f-t|^{0.3}$ increases more slowly than linear as $(f - t)$ increases.
- This slower increase means that large errors (outliers) contribute less to the overall loss.
- In contrast, the squared loss function (with $q = 2$) increases quadratically, making it heavily penalize outliers.
