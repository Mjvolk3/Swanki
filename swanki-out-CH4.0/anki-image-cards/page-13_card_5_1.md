- The image plots the function $L_{q} = |f - t|^{q}$ for various values of $q$ with $q = 10$ shown.
- The horizontal axis represents $f - t$ and the vertical axis represents $|f - t|^{q}$.
- The plot depicts that as $f - t$ moves away from 0, the value of $|f - t|^{10}$ increases sharply, creating a sharp U-shaped curve.
- This function highlights the impact of high $q$ values in the Minkowski loss function, emphasizing accuracy in prediction by heavily penalizing deviations from the target $t$.

## Describe the general shape and interpretation of the plot for $L_{q} = |f - t|^{q}$ when $q = 10$. Why is this significant for regression problems?

- The plot for $L_{q} = |f - t|^{q}$ with $q = 10$ has a sharp U-shaped curve.
- This U-shape signifies that the loss function increases very steeply as the prediction $f$ deviates from the target $t$.
- Such a steep curve indicates higher sensitivity to prediction errors, meaning deviations from $t$ will incur very high losses.
- This characteristic is crucial for regression problems as it indicates a strong emphasis on prediction accuracy.
