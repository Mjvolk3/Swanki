Explain the basic concept of single-layer networks in the context of regression discussed in the associated text.

%

A single-layer network in the context of regression is essentially a linear regression model. It has a single layer of learnable parameters. These networks, while limited in practical applicability, offer simple analytical properties and provide a foundational understanding of core neural network concepts. This is particularly useful for forming the basis for more complex discussions on deep neural networks.
