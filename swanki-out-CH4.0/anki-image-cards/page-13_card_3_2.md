What does the plot represent in the context of regression problems?

%

The plot represents the squared loss function $\left| f - t \right|^{2}$, where $f$ is the predicted value, and $t$ is the true value. The horizontal axis denotes the difference $f - t$, while the vertical axis shows the squared difference, consistent with the quadratic function used in many regression problems. The vertex at the origin indicates zero loss when prediction and true value match perfectly.

Why is the parameter $q = 2$ significant in the plot of $\left| f - t \right|^{q}$?

%

The parameter $q = 2$ is significant because it defines the Minkowski loss function, also known as the squared loss function in this context. For $q = 2$, the loss function $\left| f - t \right|^{q}$ takes the form of $\left( f - t \right)^{2}$, which is widely used in regression problems to measure the variance of the prediction errors.
