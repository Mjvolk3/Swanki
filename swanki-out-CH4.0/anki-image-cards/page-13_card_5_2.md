Explain the behavior of the function $L_{q}=|f-t|^{q}$ when $q=10$, as shown in the plot.

%
The function $L_{q}=|f-t|^{q}$ when $q=10$ exhibits a sharp increase as $f-t$ deviates from 0. This results in a steep U-shaped curve, indicating that the loss increases very steeply with larger deviations from the target value $t$, making the loss function highly sensitive to prediction errors.

What does the steepness of the curve in the plot of $L_{q}=|f-t|^{q}$ for $q=10$ imply about its sensitivity to prediction errors?

%
The steepness of the curve in the plot of $L_{q}=|f-t|^{q}$ for $q=10$ implies that this Minkowski loss function is extremely sensitive to prediction errors. Predictions that are not very close to the target value $t$ will incur a very high loss, emphasizing the necessity of accurate predictions.
