What can be inferred about the behavior of the loss function $L_{q}=|f-t|^{q}$ when $q=1$, as shown in the plot?

%

When $q=1$, the loss function $L_{q} = |f-t|^{q}$ simplifies to $|f-t|$. The plot is a V-shaped graph with its vertex at the origin (0, 0). It extends linearly upwards in both directions, indicating that as the difference between $f$ (the prediction) and $t$ (the true value) increases, the loss increases linearly, regardless of the sign of the difference. This is characteristic of the L1 loss or absolute loss, which is used when the median is the desired measure of central tendency.

## What does the V-shaped graph signify for the loss function $L_{q}=|f-t|^{q}$ when $q=1$?

The V-shaped graph signifies that the loss function $L_{q} = |f-t|$ when $q=1$ increases linearly with the absolute deviation of the predictions from the true values. It indicates that the loss is directly proportional to the absolute difference between $f$ and $t$, making it appropriate for scenarios where minimizing the median of the deviations is essential.
