## What is the effect of a high regularization parameter $\ln \lambda = 3$ on bias and variance in the model fitting shown in the image?

For a high regularization parameter ($\ln \lambda = 3$), the resulting model fits have low variance, as evidenced by the similarity of the red curves in the left plot. However, the bias is high, as the average fit (right plot's red curve) significantly diverges from the actual sinusoidal function (green curve).

## How does the model performance change with a low regularization parameter $\ln \lambda = -3$ in the context of bias and variance?

With a low regularization parameter ($\ln \lambda = -3$), the model exhibits high variance, shown by the substantial differences between each red curve in the left plot. Although this results in low bias, as the average model fit (right plot's red curve) closely follows the sinusoidal function, the model is prone to overfitting to noise within individual data sets.
