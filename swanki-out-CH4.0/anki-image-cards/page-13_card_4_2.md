**Describe the plot of the Minkowski loss function for \( q = 1 \).**

%

The plot of the Minkowski loss function for \( q = 1 \), labeled as \( L_q = |f - t|^1 \), shows a V-shaped graph. It simplifies to the absolute value function \( |f - t| \). The plot has its vertex at the origin (0, 0) and extends linearly upwards in both directions. This indicates that the loss increases linearly with the absolute deviation of \( f \) from \( t \), irrespective of the sign of the difference. The horizontal axis represents \( f - t \) (the difference between prediction and target), and the vertical axis represents the loss.

**What characteristic does the plot of the Minkowski loss function with \( q = 1 \) indicate?**

%

The plot of the Minkowski loss function with \( q = 1 \) reflects that the loss increases directly with the absolute deviation of the predictions from the true values. This is characteristic of the L1 loss, or absolute loss, which is often used when the median is the desired measure of central tendency. The linear nature of the loss function for \( q = 1 \) implies that it is robust to outliers.
