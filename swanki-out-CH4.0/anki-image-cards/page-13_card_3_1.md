The plot shows a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at the origin. It represents the quadratic function \((f-t)^2\), commonly known as the squared loss function used in regression problems. The horizontal axis indicates the difference between a predicted value \( f \) and the true value \( t \), while the vertical axis shows the squared loss \( L_{q} \) for \( q = 2 \).
