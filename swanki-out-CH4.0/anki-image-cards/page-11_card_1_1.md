The regression function $f^{\star}(x)$, which minimizes the expected squared loss, is given by the mean of the conditional distribution $p(t \mid x)$.

Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L]=\iint \{f(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \mathrm{d} t
$$

This function $f^{\star}(x)$ represents the expected value of $t$ given $x$, thus simplifying the probability distribution $p(t \mid x)$ to a single prediction value for practical decision-making.

## Explain the squared-loss function and how it differs from the sum-of-squares error function as mentioned.

The squared-loss function in regression is given by:

$$
L(t, f(\mathbf{x}))=\{f(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2}
$$

The expected loss can be formulated as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L]=\iint \{f(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \mathrm{d} t
$$

This should not be confused with the sum-of-squares error function which is used to set parameters during training in order to determine the conditional probability distribution $p(t \mid \mathbf{x})$. The loss function, on the other hand, governs how this distribution is utilized to arrive at a predictive function $f(\mathbf{x})$.
