## At what value of $\ln \lambda$ does the minimum sum of squared bias and variance occur? How does it relate to the test error?

The minimum sum of squared bias and variance occurs around $\ln \lambda = 0.43$. This value is close to the value of $\ln \lambda$ that gives the minimum test error, indicating an optimal balance between bias and variance, which consequently minimizes the generalization error of the model.
