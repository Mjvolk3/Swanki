## Define the regularization parameter $\lambda$ and its role in model complexity.

The regularization parameter $\lambda$ is used to control the complexity of a model. In the context of Figure 4.7, it's observed that the value of $\lambda$ affects the bias and variance of the fitted model. For large $\lambda$, the model is overly simple, leading to high bias and low variance; for small $\lambda$, the model is overly complex, resulting in low bias and high variance.

## How many total parameters are in the model, including the bias parameter?

Including the bias parameter, the total number of parameters in the model is $M=25$.

## How many data points and data sets were used in Figure 4.7?

In Figure 4.7, there are $L=100$ data sets, each having $N=25$ data points.

## For understanding bias and variance trade-offs, why is it important to consider multiple data sets?

Considering multiple data sets ($L=100$ in this case) helps in observing the variability of the model's performance and provides a better understanding of the bias-variance trade-off. Averaging over multiple fits offers insight into the expected bias and variance for different regularization parameters $\lambda$.

## Explain why only 20 of the 100 fits are shown for various values of $\ln \lambda$ in the left column of Figure 4.7.

For clarity, only 20 of the 100 fits are displayed. Displaying all 100 fits could clutter the plot, making it difficult to observe the patterns and effects of the regularization parameter $\lambda$.
