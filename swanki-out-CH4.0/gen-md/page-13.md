## Explain the Bias-Variance Trade-off in the context of linear models for regression. 

When discussing the bias-variance trade-off, it is essential to balance between model complexity and over-fitting. The trade-off is primarily about:

- Bias: Error due to overly simple models not capturing underlying patterns.
- Variance: Error due to models capturing noise in the training data.

The goal is to find an optimal balance where the model performs well on both training and unseen data.

## What is the impact of limiting the number of basis functions in a linear regression model?

Limiting the number of basis functions in a linear regression model:

- Avoids over-fitting by reducing model complexity.
- Limits the flexibility to capture important trends in the data.

## Describe the consequence of using maximum likelihood estimation in linear models for regression when dealing with limited data sets.

Using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in linear models for regression with limited data sets can lead to:

- Severe over-fitting.
- Poor generalization to new data.
This happens because MLE tends to fit the training data too closely, especially in complex models.

## What role does the regularization coefficient $\lambda$ play in controlling over-fitting in linear regression models?

The regularization coefficient $\lambda$:

- Controls over-fitting by penalizing large coefficients in the model.
- Helps in maintaining a balance where the model can generalize well on unseen data.

## How can one determine a suitable value for the regularization coefficient $\lambda$?

Determining a suitable value for the regularization coefficient $\lambda$ involves:

- Using cross-validation techniques.
- Evaluating model performance over a range of $\lambda$ values.

Selecting $\lambda$ where the validation performance is optimal often provides a balanced model.

## What is the effect of regularization on models with many parameters in the context of regression?

In regression models with many parameters, regularization:

- Controls over-fitting by adding a penalty for large parameter values.
- Ensures the model's parameters do not grow excessively, keeping the model simpler and more robust.

$$
\text{Regularization term: } \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} w_j^2
$$

where $\lambda$ is the regularization coefficient, $p$ is the number of parameters, and $w_j$ are the model parameters.
