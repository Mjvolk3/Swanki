## Describe the sinuisoidal function used to generate the data points.

The sinusoidal function used to generate the data points is $h(x) = \sin(2 \pi x)$.

- This function creates a smooth, periodic wave which is particularly useful for understanding the behavior of models under regularization constraints.

## What is the formula for estimating the average prediction, and explain its components.

The average prediction $\bar{f}(x)$ is estimated by:

$$
\bar{f}(x)=\frac{1}{L} \sum_{l=1}^{L} f^{(l)}(x)
$$

- Here, $L$ is the number of data sets, and $f^{(l)}(x)$ is the prediction function for the $l$-th data set. The formula averages the predictions over the $L$ different models.

## Provide the equations for integrated squared bias and integrated variance and explain each term.

The integrated squared bias and integrated variance are given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\text {bias})^{2} & =\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{\bar{f}\left(x_{n}\right)-h\left(x_{n}\right)\right\}^{2} \\
\text {variance} & =\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{L} \sum_{l=1}^{L}\left\{f^{(l)}\left(x_{n}\right)-\bar{f}\left(x_{n}\right)\right\}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

- $N$ is the number of data points, $L$ is the number of data sets, $\bar{f}(x_n)$ is the average prediction, and $h(x_n)$ is the true function. The bias term quantifies the difference between the average prediction and the true function, while the variance term quantifies the variability of predictions around their average.

## Explain why averaging many solutions for a complex model with $M=25$ parameters might be beneficial.

Averaging many solutions for a complex model with $M=25$ parameters can be beneficial as it tends to provide a very good fit to the regression function $h(x)$ by reducing overfitting and leveraging the strengths of multiple models. This ensemble approach is aligned with Bayesian methods that average with respect to the posterior distribution of parameters.

## What impact does a large regularization coefficient $\lambda$ have on the bias and variance in a model?

A large value of the regularization coefficient $\lambda$ results in low variance and high bias. This occurs because the regularization tends to shrink the model parameters, making all models look similar (low variance) but potentially far from the true function (high bias).

## Discuss the practical limitations of the bias-variance decomposition.

The bias-variance decomposition, although useful for providing insights into model complexity, is of limited practical value because it relies on averages with respect to ensembles of data sets. In practice, we often only have a single observed data set. If we had multiple independent training sets, combining them into a larger set would be more effective in reducing overfitting.
