## Explain the optimal prediction under the squared-loss function in the context of a regression problem, given the conditional distribution $p(t \mid \mathbf{x})$.

The optimal prediction for the squared-loss function is given by the conditional expectation:

$$
h(\mathbf{x})=\mathbb{E}[t \mid \mathbf{x}]=\int t p(t \mid \mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} t
$$

This prediction minimizes the expected squared loss as $h(\mathbf{x})$ represents the average value of $t$ given the data point $\mathbf{x}$.

## What is the expected squared loss composed of?

The expected squared loss $\mathbb{E}[L]$ can be decomposed into two main terms:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L]=\int\{f(\mathbf{x})-h(\mathbf{x})\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}+\iint\{h(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \mathrm{d} t
$$

The first term $\int\{f(\mathbf{x})-h(\mathbf{x})\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}$ depends on our choice for the function $f(\mathbf{x})$ and is the error due to the model. The second term $\iint\{h(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \mathrm{d} t$ represents the intrinsic noise of the data and is independent of $f(\mathbf{x})$.

## What does the second term in the expected squared loss $\mathbb{E}[L]$ represent?

The second term in the expected squared loss 

$$
\iint\{h(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \mathrm{d} t
$$

arises from the intrinsic noise on the data and represents the minimum achievable value of the expected loss, which is independent of the choice of $f(\mathbf{x})$.

## Why can the first term, $\int\{f(\mathbf{x})-h(\mathbf{x})\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}$, achieve a minimum value of zero in the expected squared loss?

The first term,

$$
\int\{f(\mathbf{x})-h(\mathbf{x})\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x},
$$

can achieve a minimum value of zero because $f(\mathbf{x})$ can be made to approximate $h(\mathbf{x})$ as closely as possible given an unlimited supply of data and computational resources. This would represent the optimal choice for $f(\mathbf{x})$.

## How does a frequentist approach handle model uncertainty compared to a Bayesian perspective?

In a frequentist approach, model uncertainty is handled through a point estimate of the parameter vector $\mathbf{w}$ based on the data set $\mathcal{D}$. This is in contrast to a Bayesian perspective, where uncertainty is expressed through a posterior distribution over $\mathbf{w}$. The frequentist approach assesses the performance by averaging over an ensemble of data sets drawn from the distribution $p(t, \mathbf{x})$.

## Explain the bias-variance trade-off in the context of frequentist viewpoint and why it's important in regression models.

The bias-variance trade-off addresses the problem of balancing model complexity and prediction accuracy. High bias (underfitting) happens when the model is too simple to capture the data patterns, leading to poor prediction on training and unseen data. High variance (overfitting) occurs when the model is too complex, capturing noise along with the underlying pattern, leading to poor generalization. This trade-off is crucial because it guides the choice of model complexity and regularization, aiming for a good equilibrium to minimize the expected prediction error.
