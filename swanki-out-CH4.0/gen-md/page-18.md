## Consider the sum-of-squares error function given by (1.2) in which the function $y(x, \mathbf{w})$ is a polynomial. Show that the coefficients $\mathbf{w} = \{ w_i \}$ that minimize this error function are given by the solution to the following set of linear equations:

$$
\sum_{j=0}^{M} A_{i j} w_{j}=T_{i}
$$

## The sum-of-squares error function is given by:

$$
E(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( y_n - y(x_n, \mathbf{w}) \right)^2
$$ 

The polynomial can be written as:

$$
y(x, \mathbf{w}) = \sum_{i=0}^{M} w_i x^i
$$

To minimize the error function, we take the partial derivative with respect to each $w_i$ and set it to zero:

$$
\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_i} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( y_n - \sum_{j=0}^{M} w_j x_n^j \right) (- x_n^i) = 0
$$

By arranging terms, we obtain the set of linear equations

$$
\sum_{j=0}^{M} \left( \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_n^{i+j} \right) w_j = \sum_{n=1}^{N} y_n x_n^i
$$

Identifying $A_{ij} = \sum_{n=1}^N x_n^{i+j}$ and $T_i = \sum_{n=1}^N y_n x_n^i$, we get:

$$
\sum_{j=0}^{M} A_{i j} w_{j}=T_{i}
$$

## Write down the set of coupled linear equations, analogous to (4.53), satisfied by the coefficients $w_{i}$ that minimize the regularized sum-of-squares error function given by (1.4).

## The regularized sum-of-squares error function is defined as:

$$
E(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( y_n - y(x_n, \mathbf{w}) \right)^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{j=0}^{M} w_j^2
$$

To minimize, we need to take the partial derivative with respect to each $w_i$ and set it to zero:

$$
\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_i} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( y_n - \sum_{j=0}^{M} w_j x_n^j \right) (- x_n^i) + \lambda w_i = 0
$$

Rearranging terms, we get the set of linear equations:

$$
\sum_{j=0}^{M} \left( \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_n^{i+j} + \lambda \delta_{ij} \right) w_j = \sum_{n=1}^{N} y_n x_n^i
$$

where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta function.

## Show that the tanh function defined by

$$
\tanh(a) = \frac{e^a - e^{-a}}{e^a + e^{-a}}
$$

is related to the logistic sigmoid function by 

$$
\tanh(a) = 2 \sigma(2a) - 1
$$

## The logistic sigmoid function is given by

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}
$$

First, note that:

$$
\sigma(2a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-2a}}
$$

Multiply numerator and denominator by $e^a$:

$$
\sigma(2a) = \frac{e^a}{e^a + e^{-a}}
$$

Rewriting $\tanh(a)$ gives:

$$
\tanh(a) = \frac{e^a - e^{-a}}{e^a + e^{-a}}
$$

Express $\tanh(a)$ in terms of $\sigma(2a)$:

$$
\tanh(a) = 2\left( \frac{e^a}{e^a + e^{-a}} \right) - 1 = 2\sigma(2a) - 1
$$

## Show that a general linear combination of logistic sigmoid functions of the form

$$
y(x, \mathbf{w}) = w_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{M} w_j \sigma \left( \frac{x - \mu_j}{s} \right)
$$

is a valid function.

## Given the logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ defined as:

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}
$$

and the general linear combination as:

$$
y(x, \mathbf{w}) = w_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{M} w_j \sigma \left( \frac{x - \mu_j}{s} \right)
$$

To demonstrate validity, use properties of linear combinations and logistic sigmoid functions. Each $\sigma \left( \frac{x - \mu_j}{s} \right)$ is bounded between 0 and 1.

By linearly combining these bounded functions, $y(x, \mathbf{w})$ remains continuous and well-defined, inheriting the smoothness and boundedness properties of the sigmoid function.

## Explain the significance of the minimum value of $(\text{bias})^2 + \text{variance}$ occurring around $\ln \lambda = 0.43$

## In the context of model bias-variance tradeoff:

- **Bias**: Error due to the model’s assumptions.
- **Variance**: Error due to model’s sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set.

The minimum value of $(\text{bias})^2 + \text{variance}$ indicates optimal regularization parameter $\lambda$. Around $\ln \lambda = 0.43$, the model balances underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance), as confirmed by minimized test error.

## Describe the average test set error's relationship with the value $\ln \lambda = 0.43$

## The average test set error assesses the model's generalization performance:

$$
\text{Test Error} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \hat{y}_i - y_i \right)^2
$$

At $\ln \lambda = 0.43$, the sum of squared bias and variance is minimized, leading to the lowest test set error. This value of $\lambda$ reflects the optimal complexity level of the model, achieving the best balance between bias and variance for generalization to unseen data.
