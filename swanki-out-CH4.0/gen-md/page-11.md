## What is the regression function $f^\star(x)$ that minimizes the expected squared loss?

The regression function $f^\star(x)$ that minimizes the expected squared loss is given by the mean of the conditional distribution $p(t \mid x)$.

$$
f^\star(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}_{t}[t \mid \mathbf{x}]
$$

This function represents the conditional average of $t$ given $\mathbf{x}$.

## Define the expected loss $\mathbb{E}[L]$ in the context of regression problems.

The expected loss $\mathbb{E}[L]$ in the context of regression problems, when using a loss function $L(t, f(\mathbf{x}))$, is defined as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L]=\iint L(t, f(\mathbf{x})) p(\mathbf{x}, t) \, d\mathbf{x} \, dt
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ and $t$ are the input and target variables, respectively, and $p(\mathbf{x}, t)$ is their joint distribution.

## What is a common choice of loss function in regression problems, and how is the expected loss $\mathbb{E}[L]$ written using this loss function?

A common choice of loss function in regression problems is the squared loss, defined as $L(t, f(\mathbf{x}))=\{f(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2}$. The expected loss using this function can be written as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L]=\iint\{f(\mathbf{x})-t\}^{2} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \, d\mathbf{x} \, dt
$$

This function penalizes the difference between the predicted and actual target values.

## How do we formally minimize $\mathbb{E}[L]$ for a flexible function $f(\mathbf{x})$ using calculus of variations?

To formally minimize $\mathbb{E}[L]$ for a flexible function $f(\mathbf{x})$, we use the calculus of variations. This can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{\delta \mathbb{E}[L]}{\delta f(\mathbf{x})}= 2 \int\{f(\mathbf{x})-t\} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \, dt = 0
$$

Solving this equation results in the regression function $f^\star(\mathbf{x})$.

## Derive the regression function $f^\star(\mathbf{x})$ from the expected loss equation.

Starting from the expected loss equation

$$
\frac{\delta \mathbb{E}[L]}{\delta f(\mathbf{x})}= 2 \int\{f(\mathbf{x})-t\} p(\mathbf{x}, t) \, dt = 0,
$$

we solve for $f(\mathbf{x})$:

$$
f^\star(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{p(\mathbf{x})} \int t p(\mathbf{x}, t) \, dt = \int t p(t \mid \mathbf{x}) \, dt = \mathbb{E}_{t}[t \mid \mathbf{x}].
$$

This shows that $f^\star(\mathbf{x})$ is the conditional average of $t$ given $\mathbf{x}$.

## How is the regression function $f^\star(\mathbf{x})$ extended to multiple target variables $\mathbf{t}$?

For multiple target variables represented by the vector $\mathbf{t}$, the regression function $\mathbf{f}^\star(\mathbf{x})$ is the conditional average $\mathbb{E}_{t}[\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}]$. Thus, it can be written as:

$$
\mathbf{f}^\star(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}_{t}[\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}]
$$

This extension is applicable to situations where the output is a vector rather than a scalar.
