## What is the predictive distribution for a regression problem where both $\mathbf{w}$ and $\sigma^{2}$ are learned from data using maximum likelihood?

The predictive distribution for a regression problem where both $\mathbf{w}$ and $\sigma^{2}$ are learned from data using maximum likelihood is given by:

$$
p\left(t \mid \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ML}}, \sigma_{\mathrm{ML}}^{2}\right)=\mathcal{N}\left(t \mid y\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ML}}\right), \sigma_{\mathrm{ML}}^{2}\right)
$$

Here, $y\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}\right)$ represents the mean, which is dependent on $\mathbf{x}$ and the learned parameters $\mathbf{w}$. The variance $\sigma_{\mathrm{ML}}^{2}$ is also learned from the data.

## Explain the intuition behind using $f(\mathbf{x})=y\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ML}}\right)$ as a prediction and when it may be appropriate.

The intuition behind using $f(\mathbf{x})=y\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ML}}\right)$ for prediction stems from the idea of predicting the mean of the conditional distribution $p(t \mid \mathbf{x})$. For many practical applications, predicting the average or expected value makes sense. This method is particularly useful when the loss function is quadratic, as the mean minimizes the expected squared loss.

However, while this intuition may be accurate for certain scenarios, it can lead to poor results in situations where the underlying assumptions do not hold, such as in the presence of skewed distributions or when using different loss functions. Decision theory helps to determine when mean predictions are appropriate and under what assumptions.

## Describe the two-stage process involved in decision theory for making predictions based on the predictive distribution.

The two-stage process in decision theory for making predictions involves:

1. **Inference Stage**: In this stage, we use the training data to determine a predictive distribution $p(t \mid \mathbf{x})$. This involves finding the form of the distribution that best models the data.

2. **Decision Stage**: In this stage, we use the predictive distribution obtained in the inference stage to determine a specific value $f(\mathbf{x})$. This value is chosen to minimize a loss function $L(t, f(\mathbf{x}))$, which depends on both the predictive distribution and the specific value chosen. The loss function reflects the penalty or cost for the discrepancy between the predicted and true values.

## How does the solution to the regression problem decouple between different target variables $t_k$?

The solution to the regression problem decouples between different target variables $t_{k}$ by treating each target variable independently. Since we only need to compute a single pseudo-inverse matrix $\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\dagger}$, which is shared by all the vectors $\mathbf{w}_{k}$, the problem breaks down into $K$ independent regression problems. This decoupling occurs because the parameters $\mathbf{W}$ define only the mean of the Gaussian noise distribution, which is independent of the covariance matrix.

## In the context of decision theory, what is the expected loss and how is it minimized?

The expected loss in decision theory is the average penalty incurred by a prediction function $f(\mathbf{x})$ when the true value is $t$. It is given by:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L(t, f(\mathbf{x}))]
$$

To minimize the expected loss, we choose the prediction function $f(\mathbf{x})$ that lowers this average loss based on the predictive distribution $p(t \mid \mathbf{x})$ and the cost associated with the loss function $L(t, f(\mathbf{x}))$. This approach ensures that the prediction minimizes the long-term cost when faced with uncertainty in the true value of $t$.

## What role does the pseudo-inverse matrix $\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\dagger}$ play in the regression problem with general Gaussian noise distributions?

The pseudo-inverse matrix $\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\dagger}$ plays a crucial role in decoupling the regression problem between different target variables $t_{k}$. By computing this single pseudo-inverse matrix, it allows for the independent estimation of regression parameters $\mathbf{w}_{k}$ for each target variable. This means that each target is solved using its corresponding vector $\mathbf{t}_{k}$, utilizing the shared structure provided by $\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\dagger}$.
