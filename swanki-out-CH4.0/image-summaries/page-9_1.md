ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image appears to be a schematic representation of a neural network with a single layer linear model architecture used in machine learning, specifically for regression tasks. The network consists of several nodes (represented as circles in the image) connected by lines, which typically symbolize the weighted connections between the inputs and outputs.

At the bottom, there is a node labeled with \(\phi_0(x)\), indicating the bias node, which usually corresponds to the bias term in a linear model where no input is needed (it always outputs 1). Above this node, there are other nodes labeled with \(\phi_1(x)\) to \(\phi_{M-1}(x)\), representing the basis functions for the input data \(x\).

The top layer nodes are labeled with \(y_1(x, w)\) to \(y_K(x, w)\), representing the output nodes of the network for multiple target variables \(y_1, \ldots, y_K\). They correspond to the predicted outputs of the model, each determined by a distinct weighted sum of the transformed input features through the basis functions. The solid arrows indicate the mapping from the input functions (\(\phi\) nodes) to the output nodes.

The diagram serves as a visualization for the concepts described in the text regarding linear regression models, basis functions, and regularization, as well as the extension of these concepts to models that predict multiple outputs (\(K>1\)).
