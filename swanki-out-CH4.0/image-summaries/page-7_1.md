ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a geometric illustration of the least squares solution in an N-dimensional space. It shows a diagram with three axes. The red outline depicts a two-dimensional subspace 'S'. Inside this subspace, two vectors are shown, labeled as 'φ1' and 'φ2', which represent two basis functions projected in the N-dimensional space. The green vector labeled 't' stands perpendicularly outside of the subspace 'S', representing the vector of target values in the N-dimensional space. The blue vector labeled 'y' is inside the subspace 'S' and represents the least squares solution—it is the orthogonal projection of vector 't' onto the subspace 'S'. This diagram serves to visualize how the regression function in a least squares problem is effectively the projection of the data onto the subspace spanned by the basis functions.
