ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image pertains to a graphical illustration from the paper referenced in the context. It depicts a graph with two axes, labeled "t" on the vertical axis and "x" on the horizontal axis. The graph includes two curves:

1. A probability distribution p(t|x0, w, σ^2), which is typically a Gaussian curve centered around a specific value of x (x0). This curve represents the probability distribution of the target variable "t" given a specific input "x0" and parameters "w" and "σ^2".

2. A regression function f*(x), which appears as a smooth curve and represents the expected value (mean) of the conditional distribution p(t|x). This function gives the optimal prediction, which minimizes the expected squared loss, as mentioned in the context provided.

The key point here is that the regression function curve simplifies the entire probability distribution for a given input "x" to a single optimal prediction value, which is the mean of that distribution. This is useful in practical applications where a specific prediction or decision needs to be made based on probabilistic models.
