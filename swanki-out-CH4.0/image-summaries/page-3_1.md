ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a diagram representing a simple neural network used to illustrate the linear regression model with basis functions. Here is a description of its components:

- There are several input nodes, each corresponding to a different basis function \(\phi_j(\textbf{x})\), where \(j\) ranges from 0 to \(M-1\). These are represented by the circles on the left side of the diagram.
- The basis functions are connected to an output node by lines, each line representing a parameter \(w_j\). 
- The solid node at the bottom left, representing \(\phi_0(\textbf{x})\), signifies the 'bias' basis function, which is often set to a constant value of 1.
- The output node, represented by the circle on the right side, corresponds to the function \(y(\textbf{x}, \textbf{w})\).
- The purpose of the diagram is to depict how a linear combination of weighted basis functions can be used to predict a continuous target variable.

Overall, this neural network diagram is a visual representation of the linear regression model from the paper, where the linear model is expressed as the weighted sum of basis functions, as described by the equation \(y(\textbf{x}, \textbf{w}) = \sum_{j=0}^{M-1} w_{j} \phi_{j}(\textbf{x})\).
