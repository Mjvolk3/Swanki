ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows four plots of the Minkowski loss function \(L_{q} = |f - t|^q\) against \(f - t\) for various values of \(q\). Each plot corresponds to a different value of the exponent \(q\), as indicated above each plot. The graphs demonstrate how the Minkowski loss function changes shape as the exponent \(q\) varies.

The upper-left plot corresponds to \(q = 0.3\), resulting in a function that forms a well that is very steep around \(f - t = 0\) and flattens out quickly as \(f - t\) moves away from zero.

The upper-right plot corresponds to \(q = 1\), indicating the absolute loss which forms a V shape. This is the linear case where the gradient doesn't change with the distance between the prediction and the target.

The bottom-left plot corresponds to \(q = 2\), representing the standard squared loss function, where the function is a symmetrical parabola about \(f - t = 0\), indicating that the penalty increases quadratically as predictions deviate from the target.

The bottom-right plot corresponds to \(q = 10\), showing the function for a much larger value of \(q\), resulting in a very steep and narrow well around \(f - t = 0\), suggesting a very high penalty for even slight deviations from the target value.

These plots help to visualize the effect of different \(q\) values on the loss function's sensitivity to errors. For regression problems, the choice of \(q\) in the Minkowski loss function can significantly affect the robustness and sensitivity of the regression model to outliers.
