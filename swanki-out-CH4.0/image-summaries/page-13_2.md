ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image shows a plot of a mathematical function, specifically a plot of \( |f-t|^q \) for \( q = 0.3 \), where \( f \) and \( t \) are variables representing the predicted value and the target value, respectively. The function is plotted on the Cartesian plane, with the horizontal axis labeled as \( f-t \) and the vertical axis labeled as \( |f-t|^{0.3} \).

The curve depicted has a V-like shape, which is characteristic for graphs of absolute value functions to a power less than 1. The plot shows that as the difference between \( f \) and \( t \) increases (either positively or negatively), the value of \( |f-t|^q \) also increases, but at a slower rate than linear due to the exponent \( 0.3 \) being less than 1. The purpose of such a plot is to illustrate how different values of \( q \) in the Minkowski loss function affect the shape of the loss curve, which is related to the penalty for errors in a regression task. A lower value of \( q \) makes the loss function less sensitive to outliers than the squared loss where \( q = 2 \).
