ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows three pairs of plots symbolizing the relationship between bias and variance with respect to model complexity in a regression context. Each pair corresponds to a different value of the regularization parameter $\lambda$, as indicated by the values of $\ln \lambda$: 3, 1, and -3.

For each pair of plots:

- The left plot in a pair shows the results of fitting a regression model to the data for that particular $\ln \lambda$ value. The red curves represent the model fits to each of the 20 randomly sampled out of the 100 data sets (from a larger total of $L=100$ data sets). The aim is to model a sinusoidal function (not shown in these individual plots), and how well the red curves match this sinusoidal form depends on the regularization parameter.

- The right plot in a pair displays the average of the 100 fits (red curve) alongside the original sinusoidal function (green curve) from which the data sets were generated. The average fit is calculated using the equation provided in the context, and its closeness to the sinusoidal curve is a measure of the overall model performance.

The three pairs of plots correspond to:

1. A relatively large regularization parameter (top row, $\ln \lambda = 3$), which results in low variance—the red curves in the left plot are quite similar to each other. However, it also leads to high bias, as the average model fit (right plot's red curve) significantly diverges from the actual sinusoidal function (green curve).

2. A moderate regularization parameter (middle row, $\ln \lambda = 1$), which strikes a balance between the amount of variance and bias. The red curves in the left plot show more variability compared to the top row, but less compared to the bottom row. The average model fit (right plot's red curve) is closer to the original sinusoidal function (green curve) than in the top row.

3. A small regularization parameter (bottom row, $\ln \lambda = -3$), which allows for a much higher variance—visible by the substantial differences between each red curve in the left plot. Even though this leads to a low bias, as the average model fit (right plot's red curve) closely follows the sinusoidal function, it also means that the model is likely overfitting to the noise within individual data sets.

Together, these visualizations illustrate how tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$ can
