ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image appears to be a plot of a function which is labeled with the quantity \(|f - t|^q\) for \(q = 2\). The plot shows a parabola that opens upwards, with its vertex at the origin, indicating that the function plotted is a quadratic function of form \((f-t)^2\), which is consistent with the common form of the squared loss function used in regression problems. The horizontal axis represents the difference between a predicted value \(f\) and the true value \(t\), and the vertical axis represents the squared difference, which is the loss for a given prediction error. The label \(q=2\) denotes that the Minkowski loss function is being used with \(q=2\), which corresponds to the squared loss.
