ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided is a plot of the Minkowski loss function for \( q = 1 \), as indicated by the label on the plot. It is a V-shaped graph that shows the function \( L_q = |f - t|^q \), which in this case simplifies to the absolute value of \( f - t \) because \( q = 1 \). The plot has its vertex at the origin, (0, 0), and extends linearly upwards in both directions, indicating that as the difference between \( f \) and \( t \) increases, the loss increases linearly, irrespective of the sign of the difference. The plot has axes labeled, with the horizontal axis representing the difference \( f - t \), and the vertical axis representing the loss \( |f - t|^1 \). The linear nature of the plot when \( q = 1 \) reflects that the loss increases directly with the absolute deviation of the predictions from the true values, making it characteristic of the L1 loss or absolute loss, often used when the median is the desired measure of central tendency.
