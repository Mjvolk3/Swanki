ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows three separate plots, each representing a different type of basis function used in the context of a linear regression model or a simple neural network.

On the left, the plot shows polynomial basis functions. These are curves that represent various polynomial equations, indicating the influence of different powers of a single input variable `x`. Essentially, the curves seem to represent the functions \( \phi_j(x) = x^j \) for different values of `j`, resulting in lines that vary from linear (a simple angled line) to higher-order polynomials (curved lines that can have multiple turning points).

The center plot displays Gaussian basis functions. In this case, the curves illustrate the Gaussian function as described in the text, which takes the form \( \phi_j(x) = \exp \left\{-\frac{(x-\mu_j)^2}{2s^2}\right\} \), where \( \mu_j \) indicates the location and `s` the scale. Each curve looks like a bell-shaped Gaussian distribution, centered at different values of `x`, corresponding to different \( \mu_j \) values.

On the right, the sigmoidal basis functions are illustrated. A sigmoidal basis function of the form \( \phi_j(x) = \sigma\left(\frac{x-\mu_j}{s}\right) \), where \( \sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-a)} \), is a logistic sigmoid function. Each curve in this plot represents a sigmoid function shifted along the x-axis (horizontal), indicating the different \( \mu_j \) values. The sigmoid functions display an "S"-shaped curve, transitioning smoothly from 0 to 1.

All of these basis functions are used to transform input data into a space where a linear combination can be made to best fit the target data, as per a regression or machine learning model. Each type offers a different way of representing features and contributes differently to the model's ability to approximate complex functions.
