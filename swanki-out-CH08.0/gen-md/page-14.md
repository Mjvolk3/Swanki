## Describe the limitations of symbolic differentiation highlighted in the given paper segment.

Symbolic differentiation has multiple limitations in the context of neural networks:
1. **Complex expressions**: The resulting expressions can be significantly more complicated than the original function.
2. **Redundant computations**: Expressions are often repeated, leading to inefficiencies.
3. **Control flow Operations**: It requires the expression to be in closed form and cannot handle loops, recursions, conditional execution, or procedure calls.

## Explain the primary advantage of automatic differentiation over symbolic differentiation regarding expression complexity and efficiency.

Automatic differentiation is more efficient than symbolic differentiation as it avoids redundant evaluations of intermediate variables used in the forward propagation equations. Rather than finding a mathematical expression for the derivatives, it automatically generates the code needed to compute them accurately. This reduces the complexity of expressions and boosts computational efficiency.

## Prove the gradient $\frac{\partial y}{\partial w_{1}}$ is correct given the function in the exercise 8.13

Using the provided expression:
$$
\frac{\partial y}{\partial w_{1}}=\frac{w_{2} x \exp \left(w_{1} x+b_{1}+b_{2}+w_{2} \ln \left[1+e^{w_{1} x+b_{1}}\right]\right)}{\left(1+e^{w_{1} x+b_{1}}\right)\left(1+\exp \left(b_{2}+w_{2} \ln \left[1+e^{w_{1} x+b_{1}}\right]\right)\right)}
$$
we will verify each step by applying the proper differentiation rules, like chain and product rules.

Step-by-step, differentiate both numerator and denominator parts accordingly, checking each sub-expression consistency.

## Illustrate the concept of forward-mode automatic differentiation using intermediate variables.

Forward-mode automatic differentiation augments each intermediate variable $z_{i}$ with a 'tangent' variable $\dot{z}_{i}$, representing the value of some derivative of that variable. These tangent variables and associated code are generated during the evaluation of a function, such as a neural network's error function.

For example, if $z_1 = w_1 x + b_1$, then the tangent variable $\dot{z}_1$ could represent $\frac{\partial z_1}{\partial w_1}$ during the execution.

## Explain how automatic differentiation can handle control flow elements while symbolic differentiation cannot.

Unlike symbolic differentiation, automatic differentiation can deal with control flow elements such as branches, loops, recursion, and procedure calls. This is because it augments the execution code with additional derivative calculations rather than rewriting the entire mathematical expression. This flexibility allows it to be applied to more general programming constructs.

## What is a key role of automatic differentiation in modern deep learning?

Automatic differentiation plays a key role in enabling the accurate and efficient experimentation needed in modern deep learning. It allows for the evaluation and comparison of different architectures without requiring manual differentiation of complex models.
