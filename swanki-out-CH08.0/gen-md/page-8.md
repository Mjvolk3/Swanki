## In numerical methods, how does the error behave with decreasing $\epsilon$ for finite differences?

%

For finite differences, the error initially decreases linearly with decreasing $\epsilon$. This linear decrease in error exhibits a power law behavior, as the slope of the line on a logarithmic scale is 1, meaning the error behaves like $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$. However, as $\epsilon$ becomes very small, the error reaches the limit of numerical round-off, and further reduction in $\epsilon$ leads to a noisy line where the error increases with decreasing $\epsilon$.

## In the given paper, what type of behavior does the central difference error exhibit with respect to decreasing $\epsilon$?

%

The error for central differences decreases quadratically with decreasing $\epsilon$ as indicated by the slope of the line being 2 on a logarithmic scale. This means that central difference error behaves like $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$. Therefore, central differences show a much smaller error compared to finite differences for small $\epsilon$.

## How is the Jacobian matrix $J_{ki}$ defined in the context of neural networks?

The Jacobian matrix $J_{ki}$, pertaining to neural networks, is defined by the elements given by the partial derivatives of the network outputs with respect to the inputs:

$$
J_{k i} \equiv \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}}
$$

Here, each derivative is evaluated with all other inputs held fixed.

## Explain the importance of the Jacobian matrix in systems with multiple distinct modules.

The Jacobian matrix is significant in systems composed of multiple distinct modules because it measures the local sensitivity of the outputs to changes in each of the input variables. Such systems can be built using fixed or learnable functions (linear or nonlinear) as long as they are differentiable. The matrix elements provide insight into how changes in inputs propagate through the system, which is especially useful for error minimization and sensitivity analysis.

## In terms of minimizing an error function $E$ with respect to a parameter $w$ in a network, how is the derivative of $E$ expressed?

The derivative of the error function $E$ with respect to the parameter $w$ is expressed as:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial w}=\sum_{k, j} \frac{\partial E}{\partial y_{k}} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial z_{j}} \frac{\partial z_{j}}{\partial w}
$$

In this equation, the Jacobian matrix for the intermediate module (red module in Figure 8.3) appears as the middle term on the right-hand side. This breakdown of the derivative helps in understanding how changes in $w$ affect the overall error through the different layers of the network.

## Why does the finite difference error initially decrease linearly on a logarithmic scale but eventually increase for very small $\epsilon$?

Initially, the finite difference error decreases linearly on a logarithmic scale because the slope of the error line is 1, showing a power law behavior of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$. However, for very small $\epsilon$, the effect of numerical round-off errors becomes significant and causes the error to increase again, showing increased noise and deviation from the expected linear decrease pattern.
