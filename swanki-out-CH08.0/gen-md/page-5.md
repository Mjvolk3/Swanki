## Describe the forward propagation steps involved in the Backpropagation Algorithm.

In the Backpropagation Algorithm, forward propagation involves computing the activation of each unit in the network. This is done in two steps:

1. For each hidden and output unit $j$, compute the pre-activation $a_j$:

$$
a_{j} \leftarrow \sum_{i} w_{j i} z_{i}
$$

2. Apply the activation function $h(a)$ to obtain the output $z_j$ of each unit:

$$
z_{j} \leftarrow h\left(a_{j}\right)
$$

Here, $w_{j i}$ are the network parameters and $z_i$ represents the input or the output from a previous layer.

## Explain how error evaluation is performed in the Backpropagation Algorithm.

In the Backpropagation Algorithm, the error evaluation step involves computing the error term $\delta_k$ for each output unit $k$. This is calculated as follows:

$$
\delta_{k} \leftarrow \frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial a_{k}}
$$

Here, $E_n$ is the error function for the input $\mathbf{x}_n$, and $a_k$ is the pre-activation of the output unit $k$.

## How are the error derivatives $\left\{\partial E_{n} / \partial w_{j i}\right\}$ computed in the Backpropagation Algorithm?

The error derivatives $\left\{\partial E_{n} / \partial w_{j i}\right\}$ are computed during the backward propagation step by evaluating the derivatives recursively. The key steps are:

1. Compute $\delta_{j}$ for hidden units using:

$$
\delta_{j} \leftarrow h^{\prime}\left(a_{j}\right) \sum_{k} w_{k j} \delta_{k}
$$

2. Calculate the derivatives $\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}$ as:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}} \leftarrow \delta_{j} z_{i}
$$

Here, $\delta_j$ is the error term for each hidden unit $j$, and $w_{k j}$ are the network weights.

## How is the total error derivative computed in batch methods for the Backpropagation Algorithm?

In batch methods, the derivative of the total error $E$ is computed by summing the derivatives over all data points in the batch or mini-batch. This is done as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{j i}}=\sum_{n} \frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}
$$

Here, $\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}$ is the derivative of the error for individual data point $n$, and the sum is taken over all data points in the batch.

## What role does the activation function $h(a)$ play in the Backpropagation Algorithm?

The activation function $h(a)$ plays a crucial role in the forward propagation step of the Backpropagation Algorithm. After computing the pre-activation $a_j$ for each unit $j$:

$$
a_{j} \leftarrow \sum_{i} w_{j i} z_{i}
$$

The activation function $h(a)$ is applied to $a_j$ to produce the output $z_j$:

$$
z_{j} \leftarrow h\left(a_{j}\right)
$$

The choice of activation function affects the non-linearity and expressiveness of the neural network.

## Why is the summation performed differently in forward and backward propagation in the Backpropagation Algorithm?

In the Backpropagation Algorithm, the summation index differs between forward and backward propagation due to the flow of information:

- In forward propagation, the summation is done over the second index of $w_{j i}$:

$$
a_{j} \leftarrow \sum_{i} w_{j i} z_{i}
$$

- In backward propagation, the summation is done over the first index of $w_{k j}$:

$$
\delta_{j} \leftarrow h^{\prime}\left(a_{j}\right) \sum_{k} w_{k j}\delta_{k}
$$

This reflects the opposite directions of information flow in the two processes: forward through the network layers and backward through the same layers but in reverse.
