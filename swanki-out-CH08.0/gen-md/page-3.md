## Derivation of Gradient with Respect to Weight in Feed-Forward Networks

Given the gradient of the error function with respect to a weight $w_{j i}$:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}=\left(y_{n j}-t_{n j}\right) x_{n i}
$$

Explain the interpretation of this gradient in terms of 'local' computations involving 'error signals' and input variables in the context of feed-forward networks.

%
This gradient can be interpreted as a 'local' computation involving the product of:

1. **Error Signal**: $y_{n j}-t_{n j}$, which is the difference between the predicted output ($y_{n j}$) and the target value ($t_{n j}$) associated with the output end of the link $w_{j i}$.
2. **Input Variable**: $x_{n i}$, which is the input associated with the input end of the link $w_{j i}$.

Thus, the gradient tells us how much a small change in the weight $w_{j i}$ will affect the total error based on the current prediction error and the input to the network.

## Activation Calculation in Feed-Forward Networks

Given the general form of a weighted sum for a feed-forward network unit:

$$
a_{j}=\sum_{i} w_{j i} z_{i}
$$

Describe what $z_{i}$ represents in the context of this equation.

%
In this equation:

- $z_{i}$ represents the activation of another unit or input unit that sends a connection to unit $j$.
- $w_{j i}$ is the weight associated with that connection.

The summation $\sum_{i} w_{j i} z_{i}$ represents the total input to unit $j$ (known as pre-activation), which will then be transformed by a nonlinear activation function $h(\cdot)$ to produce the activation $z_{j}$ of unit $j$.

### Card 3
## Nonlinear Activation Function in Feed-Forward Networks

Given the transformation by a nonlinear activation function:

$$
z_{j}=h\left(a_{j}\right)
$$

What role does the activation function $h(\cdot)$ play in this transformation, and why is it important?

%
The activation function $h(\cdot)$:

- **Role**: It transforms the pre-activation value $a_{j}$, which is a weighted sum of inputs, into the activation value $z_{j}$ of unit $j$.
- **Importance**: It introduces nonlinearity into the model, allowing the network to approximate complex, non-linear functions. Without a nonlinear activation function, the entire network would behave as a linear model regardless of the number of layers.

### Card 4
## Forward Propagation in Feed-Forward Networks

Explain the process of forward propagation in feed-forward networks and how it relates to equations (8.5) and (8.6):

$$
a_{j}=\sum_{i} w_{j i} z_{i}
$$

$$
z_{j}=h\left(a_{j}\right)
$$

%
Forward propagation is the process of computing the output of a neural network by sequentially applying two operations:

1. **Weighted Sum (Equation 8.5)**: Each unit computes a weighted sum of its inputs, $a_{j}=\sum_{i} w_{j i} z_{i}$.
2. **Activation Function (Equation 8.6)**: This sum is then passed through a nonlinear activation function, $z_{j}=h\left(a_{j}\right)$, to produce the activation of the unit.

The input data is thus propagated forward through the layers, from the input layer to the output layer, performing these computations at each unit.

### Card 5
## Derivation of Gradient Using Chain Rule in Feed-Forward Networks

Given the error function derivative in the context of weights:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}=\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial a_{j}} \frac{\partial a_{j}}{\partial w_{j i}}
$$

Explain the relevance of applying the chain rule for partial derivatives in this context.

%
Applying the chain rule for partial derivatives allows us to decompose the derivative of the error function $E_{n}$ with respect to the weight $w_{j i}$ into simpler components:

1. **$\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial a_{j}}$**: Captures how the error changes with respect to the pre-activation value $a_{j}$.
2. **$\frac{\partial a_{j}}{\partial w_{j i}}$**: Represents how the pre-activation value $a_{j}$ changes with respect to the weight $w_{j i}$.

This decomposition simplifies the process of calculating gradients in the context of backpropagation for training neural networks.

### Card 6
## Notation for Error Derivative in Feed-Forward Networks

Introduce and explain the notation:

$$
\delta_{j} \equiv \frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial a_{j}}
$$

%
The notation $\delta_{j}$ is introduced to simplify expressions involving the derivative of the error function $E_{n}$ with respect to the pre-activation value $a_{j}$. 

- **$\delta_{j}$**: Represents the sensitivity of the error with respect to the pre-activation of unit $j$, encapsulating how changes in $a_{j}$ affect the overall error. This helps in organizing and simplifying the backpropagation calculations in feed-forward networks.
