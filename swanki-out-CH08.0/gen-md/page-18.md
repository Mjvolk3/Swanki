## Determine the value for $\bar{v}_{7}$ in the provided system of equations.

Begin by examining the provided system of equations and determine the value of $\bar{v}_{7}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \bar{v}_{7}=1 \\
& \bar{v}_{6}=\bar{v}_{7} \\
& \bar{v}_{5}=\bar{v}_{7} \\
& \bar{v}_{4}=-\bar{v}_{6} \\
& \bar{v}_{3}=\bar{v}_{5} v_{5}+\bar{v}_{6} \\
& \bar{v}_{2}=\bar{v}_{2} v_{1}+\bar{v}_{4} \cos \left(v_{2}\right) \\
& \bar{v}_{1}=\bar{v}_{3} v_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

The value for $\bar{v}_{7}$ is given directly as $1$. This serves as the starting point for the backward evaluation of the variables.

$$ \bar{v}_{7} = 1 $$

## Compute $\bar{v}_{6}$ given the value of $\bar{v}_{7}$.

Given the value of $\bar{v}_{7}$ from the equation $\bar{v}_{7} = 1$, compute the value of $\bar{v}_{6}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \bar{v}_{7}=1 \\
& \bar{v}_{6}=\bar{v}_{7}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

Since $\bar{v}_{6}$ is directly based on $\bar{v}_{7}$, we have:

$$ \bar{v}_{6} = \bar{v}_{7} = 1 $$

Thus, $\bar{v}_{6}$ is also $1$.

## Derive the expression for $\bar{v}_{4}$ using the value of $\bar{v}_{6}$.

Given the previously computed value $\bar{v}_{6} = 1$, derive the expression for $\bar{v}_{4}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \bar{v}_{6}=\bar{v}_{7} \\
& \bar{v}_{4}=-\bar{v}_{6}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

The value of $\bar{v}_{4}$ can be derived as follows:

$$ \bar{v}_{4} = -\bar{v}_{6} = -1 $$

## Explain why reverse mode is often more memory intensive than forward mode.

Why is reverse mode automatic differentiation often more memory-intensive compared to forward mode automatic differentiation?

---

Reverse mode automatic differentiation is more memory-intensive because all of the intermediate primal variables must be stored so that they will be available when evaluating the adjoint variables during the backward pass. In contrast, forward mode computes primal and tangent variables together during the forward pass, enabling some variables to be discarded after use.

## Explain the computational cost difference between forward-mode and reverse-mode automatic differentiation.

For both forward-mode and reverse-mode automatic differentiation, what is the difference in computational cost for a single pass through the network?

---

A single pass through the network using either forward-mode or reverse-mode automatic differentiation is guaranteed to take no more than 6 times the computational cost of a single function evaluation. In practice, the overhead is typically closer to a factor of 2 or 3.

## Discuss the complexity of evaluating the Hessian matrix using forward-mode and reverse-mode hybrid.

What is the complexity of evaluating the Hessian-vector product using forward-mode and reverse-mode hybrid techniques? Mention the complexity for explicitly evaluating the Hessian as well.

---

The complexity of evaluating the Hessian-vector product using forward-mode and reverse-mode hybrid techniques is $\mathcal{O}(W)$, where $W$ is the number of parameters in the neural network. Evaluating the Hessian explicitly using automatic differentiation has $\mathcal{O}(W^2)$ complexity.
