ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image illustrates the concept of backpropagation in the context of neural networks. It shows three nodes representing units in a network. The central unit (with activation \( z_j \)) connects to two other units (with activations \( z_i \) and \( \delta_k \), \( \delta_l \)) via weighted connections (represented by lines with arrows). The weights are labeled \( w_{ji} \) for the input weight and \( w_{kj} \) for the output weights.

The forward pass of information, represented by the black arrows, moves from the \( z_i \) node through the weight \( w_{ji} \), is processed in the \( z_j \) node, and then moves outwards through the weights \( w_{kj} \), \( w_{lj} \).

The red arrows indicate the backward propagation of the 'errors' (\( \delta \)'s) during the training phase when the network is adjusting its weights. The \( \delta_j \) at the \( z_j \) node represents the partial derivative of the error with respect to the pre-activation level of that unit. The errors from the subsequent units (\( \delta_k \), \( \delta_l \)) are backpropagated to the \( z_j \) unit to adjust \( w_{ji} \), \( w_{kj} \), and \( w_{lj} \) during the learning process.

This image serves to visualize the data flow and error propagation mechanisms within a feed-forward neural network while applying the backpropagation algorithm described in the textual excerpt provided.
