ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a log-log plot comparing the errors in numerical gradient computation using two different methods: finite differences and central differences. The x-axis represents the step size (ε), on a logarithmic scale, decreasing from left to right. The y-axis represents the error in the numerical computation of the gradient of a function, also on a logarithmic scale.

The red curve represents the error associated with the finite differences method, which is linear on this log-log scale until it reaches a point where numerical round-off errors dominate. As the step size decreases (moving left along the x-axis), the error drops until it reaches this point, after which the error becomes noisy and begins to increase due to these numerical limitations.

The blue curve represents the error associated with the central differences method. This method results in a much smaller error overall compared to the finite differences method. The slope of this line indicates that the error behaves according to the order of ε^2, which shows a quadratic relationship between the error and the step size.

Overall, the plot demonstrates that central differences are a more accurate method than finite differences for computing numerical gradients, especially as the step size becomes very small. This is indicative of the practical considerations in numerical optimization and scientific computation when selecting an appropriate method for numerical differentiation.
