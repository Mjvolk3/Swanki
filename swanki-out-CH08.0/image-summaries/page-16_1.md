ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts an evaluation trace diagram that illustrates the computational graph of a function with two outputs, \( f_1 \) and \( f_2 \), as a sequence of operations based on two input variables, \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). The graph shows the steps involved in the evaluation of the function, with each node representing an intermediate variable (\( v_i \)) or output (\( f_i \)), and the edges representing the flow of computation. The intermediate variables are computed as follows:

- \( v_1 = x_1 \)
- \( v_2 = x_2 \)
- \( v_3 = v_1v_2 \)
- \( v_4 = \sin(v_2) \)
- \( v_5 = \exp(v_3) \)
- \( v_6 = v_3 - v_4 \)
- \( v_7 = v_5 + v_6 \) (which corresponds to output \( f_1 \))
- \( v_8 = v_5v_6 \) (which corresponds to output \( f_2 \))

The edges between the nodes indicate the flow of the input values \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) through the various operations represented by the intermediate variables, ultimately leading to the function outputs \( f_1 \) and \( f_2 \). This graph could be used to both evaluate the function and its derivatives using automatic differentiation algorithms, specifically by using the forward-mode or reverse-mode automatic differentiation techniques.
