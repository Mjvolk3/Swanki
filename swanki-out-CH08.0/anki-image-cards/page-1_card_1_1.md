The main objective in this chapter is to find an efficient technique for evaluating the gradient of an error function $E(\mathbf{w})$ for a feed-forward neural network using a local message-passing scheme called error backpropagation or backprop.

## What advantage do modern neural network software environments provide over historical methods of deriving and implementing backpropagation equations?

Modern neural network software environments allow virtually any derivatives of interest to be calculated efficiently with minimal effort beyond coding up the original network function, as opposed to the historical method of manually deriving and implementing backpropagation equations.
