In a modular deep learning architecture, the Jacobian matrix is used to backpropagate error signals from the outputs through to earlier modules. This error propagation can be expressed with

$$
\Delta y_{k} \simeq \sum_{i} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} \Delta x_{i},
$$

assuming that the $\left|\Delta x_{i}\right|$ are small.

## What assumption must hold true for the relation $\Delta y_{k} \simeq \sum_{i} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} \Delta x_{i}$ in the context of the Jacobian matrix?

The assumption that must hold true is that the perturbations $\left|\Delta x_{i}\right|$ are small. Additionally, since the network's mapping is nonlinear, the elements of the Jacobian matrix are not constants but depend on the specific input vector used, necessitating re-evaluation of the Jacobian for each new input vector.
