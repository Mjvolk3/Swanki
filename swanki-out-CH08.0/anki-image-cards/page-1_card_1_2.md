The primary objective of the chapter titled "Backpropagation" is to find an efficient technique for evaluating the gradient of an error function $E(\mathbf{w})$ for a feed-forward neural network using a local message-passing scheme known as error backpropagation, or backprop.

Modern neural network software environments allow virtually any derivatives of interest to be calculated efficiently with minimal effort beyond that of coding up the original network function. This eliminates the time-consuming and error-prone process of deriving and implementing backpropagation equations by hand.
