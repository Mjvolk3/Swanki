The steps involved in the numerical evaluation of the function as depicted in the evaluation trace diagram are:

1. **Input Variables**:
   - \( v_1 = x_1 \)
   - \( v_2 = x_2 \)

2. **Intermediate Calculations**:
   - \( v_3 = v_1 v_2 \)
   - \( v_4 = \sin(v_2) \)
   - \( v_5 = \exp(v_3) \)
   - \( v_6 = v_3 - v_4 \)

3. **Final Output**:
   - \( v_7 = v_5 + v_6 \)

4. **Derivative Propagation**:
   - Evaluate the function and its derivatives in tandem using forward-mode automatic differentiation.

The evaluation trace diagram facilitates forward-mode automatic differentiation by:

1. **Concurrent Evaluation**:
   - Propagating tuples \((z_i, \dot{z}_i)\) so that variables and their derivatives are evaluated in parallel.

2. **Elementary Operations**:
   - All nodes in the diagram represent basic arithmetic operations or elementary functions such as multiplication, sine, exponential, and subtraction.

3. **Chain Rule Application**:
   - The diagram uses the derivatives of elementary functions combined with the chain rule to automatically construct the gradient evaluation code.

4. **Automatic Gradient Computation**:
   - The software environment automatically generates the necessary steps to compute both the function's value and its gradient using the trace diagram.
