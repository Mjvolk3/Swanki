The modular deep learning architecture uses the Jacobian matrix to backpropagate error signals by estimating the contribution of inputs $\Delta x_i$ to the errors at the outputs, $\Delta y_k$, through the relation:

$$
\Delta y_{k} \simeq \sum_{i} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} \Delta x_{i}
$$

This assumes that the $\left|\Delta x_{i}\right|$ are small. Elements of the Jacobian matrix depend on the particular input vector, and the Jacobian must be re-evaluated for each new input vector.

Explain the validity and necessity of re-evaluating the Jacobian matrix for each new input vector in a nonlinear network mapping.

In nonlinear network mapping, re-evaluating the Jacobian matrix for each new input vector is necessary because the elements of the Jacobian matrix depend on the particular input vector. Thus, the matrix elements are not constants and will change with different inputs. The relation

$$
\Delta y_{k} \simeq \sum_{i} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} \Delta x_{i}
$$

is valid only for small perturbations of the inputs, reinforcing the need for frequent re-evaluation.
