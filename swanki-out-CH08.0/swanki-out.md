## What is the partial derivative of $y_k$ with respect to $a_l$ for an individual logistic sigmoid activation function?

For individual logistic sigmoid activation functions at each output unit, the partial derivative of $y_k$ with respect to $a_l$ is

$$
\frac{\partial y_k}{\partial a_l} = \delta_{kl}\sigma'\left(a_l\right),

For softmax outputs, the partial derivative of $y_k$ with respect to $a_l$ is given by

## How can the Jacobian matrix be calculated numerically?

The Jacobian matrix can be calculated numerically using numerical differentiation as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} = \frac{y_{k}\left(x_i + \epsilon\right) - y_{k}\left(x_i - \epsilon\right)}{2\epsilon} + \mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{2}\right),
$$

where $\epsilon$ is a small perturbation value. This method involves $2D$ forward propagation passes for a network having $D$ inputs and requires $\mathcal{O}(DW)$ steps in total.

# Card 1

## Describe the Hessian matrix in the context of neural networks and its computational implications.

The Hessian matrix is a second-order derivative matrix of the error surface often used in nonlinear optimization algorithms for training neural networks. If a network has $W$ parameters (weights and biases), the Hessian matrix will have the dimensions $W \times W$. The computational effort needed to evaluate the Hessian matrix scales like $\mathcal{O}(W^2)$ for each data point.

- #machine-learning, #optimization.hessian-matrix

# Card 2

## Explain why saving the full Hessian matrix in large-scale neural networks is impractical and discuss an approximate method.

Since neural networks may contain millions or even billions of parameters, it is impractical to save the full Hessian matrix due to its $\mathcal{O}(W^2)$ storage requirement and even more demanding $\mathcal{O}(W^3)$ computational effort to evaluate its inverse. One approximation method involves evaluating only the diagonal elements of the Hessian while setting off-diagonal elements to zero.

# Card 3

## In the context of neural networks, describe the outer product approximation method for the Hessian matrix.

Consider a regression application using a sum-of-squares error function:
$$
E=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(y_{n}-t_{n}\right)^{2}
$$
The Hessian matrix can be expressed as:
$$
\mathbf{H}=\sum_{n=1}^{N} \nabla y_{n}\left(\nabla y_{n}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}+\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(y_{n}-t_{n}\right) \nabla \nabla y_{n}
$$
If $y_n$ is very close to $t_n$, the second term will be small and can often be neglected.

## Derive the Hessian matrix for the given sum-of-squares error function in neural networks.

Given the error function:
$$
E=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(y_{n}-t_{n}\right)^{2}
$$
The Hessian matrix $\mathbf{H}$ is:
$$
\mathbf{H}=\nabla \nabla E=\sum_{n=1}^{N} \nabla y_{n}\left(\nabla y_{n}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}+\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(y_{n}-t_{n}\right) \nabla \nabla y_{n}
$$

# Card 5

## Why is the product of the Hessian matrix with a vector often used, and what is its computational complexity?

In neural networks, sometimes only the product ${ }^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{H}$ of the Hessian with a vector $\mathbf{v}$ is needed rather than the entire matrix. This product can be calculated efficiently in $\mathcal{O}(W)$ steps using an extended backpropagation method (MÃ¸ller, 1993; Pearlmutter, 1994).

# Card 6

## Discuss a situation in neural networks where neglecting certain terms in the Hessian can be justified.

Consider a sum-of-squares error function:
$$
E=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(y_{n}-t_{n}\right)^{2}
$$
If the network's outputs $y_n$ are very close to the target values $t_n$, the term $\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(y_{n}-t_{n}\right) \nabla \nabla y_{n}$ in the Hessian matrix can be neglected. This simplification is based on the fact that this term will be small for well-trained networks.

## What is the Levenberg-Marquardt approximation used for in neural networks? Describe its expression and importance.

The Levenberg-Marquardt approximation is used to estimate the Hessian matrix in neural networks. This approximation, known as the outer product approximation, is described by:

$$
\mathbf{H} \simeq \sum_{n=1}^{N} \nabla a_{n} \nabla a_{n}^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

- #neural-networks, #matrix-operation.levenberg-marquardt

##

The Levenberg-Marquardt approximation simplifies the computation of the Hessian matrix to the summation of outer products of gradient vectors ($\nabla a_{n}$). This method streamlines the evaluation by using only first derivatives of the error function, making it computationally efficient in $\mathcal{O}(W)$ steps with standard backpropagation and $\mathcal{O}\left(W^{2}\right)$ steps for matrix element multiplication.

```markdown
## Explain why the term $\left(y_{n}-t_{n}\right)$ averages to zero in the Levenberg-Marquardt approximation.

The term $\left(y_{n}-t_{n}\right)$ represents the deviation of the target data from the predicted value, which is assumed to be a random variable with zero mean. If its value is uncorrelated with the second derivative term of the right-hand side of equation (8.39), it averages to zero over $n$.

- #neural-networks, #statistics.zero-mean

##

The assumption that $\left(y_{n}-t_{n}\right)$ is uncorrelated with the second derivative term implies that the average effect of these terms cancels out, thus simplifying the computation through the Levenberg-Marquardt approximation.

- #neural-networks, #statistics.zero-mean

## What is the condition under which the Levenberg-Marquardt approximation is likely to be valid?

The Levenberg-Marquardt approximation is likely to be valid for a neural network that has been appropriately trained.

- #neural-networks, #training.hessian-approximation

##

The validity of the Levenberg-Marquardt approximation relies on the network being well-trained because, in general network mappings, the second derivative terms in equation (8.39) are typically non-negligible.

## What is the alternative expression for the Hessian approximation when using a cross-entropy error function with logistic-sigmoid output units?

For a cross-entropy error function with logistic-sigmoid output units, the Hessian approximation is given by:

$$
\mathbf{H} \simeq \sum_{n=1}^{N} y_{n}\left(1-y_{n}\right) \nabla a_{n} \nabla a_{n}^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

- #error-functions, #matrix-operation.cross-entropy

##

This form of Hessian approximation incorporates the output of the logistic-sigmoid function, $y_{n}$, adjusted by its complement, $1-y_{n}$, thus refining the accuracy of gradient calculations in logistic-sigmoid activated networks.

## What are the steps involved in evaluating the outer product approximation for the Hessian matrix?

The steps involved in evaluating the outer product approximation for the Hessian matrix include:

1. Using first derivatives of the error function, evaluated in $\mathcal{O}(W)$ steps using standard backpropagation.
2. Performing simple multiplications to obtain matrix elements in $\mathcal{O}\left(W^{2}\right)$ steps.

- #neural-networks, #matrix-operation.outer-product

The computation benefits from the efficiency of standard backpropagation for first derivatives and straightforward matrix element calculations through simple multiplications, making the overall process computationally feasible.

## Why might deriving backpropagation equations by hand be problematic for training neural networks?

Deriving backpropagation equations by hand can be problematic because it is time-consuming, error-prone, and often results in redundancy in the code when the forward and backward propagation equations are coded separately.

- #neural-networks, #training.backpropagation

##

Manually derived backpropagation equations are prone to inaccuracies and require careful synchronization between the forward and backward implementations. Any model changes necessitate updating both sets of equations, increasing the potential for errors and inefficiency.

## Differentiate the function $f(x) = u(x) v(x)$.

The differentiation of the function $f(x) = u(x) v(x)$ can be derived using the product rule of calculus:

f(x) & = u(x) v(x) \\
f^{\prime}(x) & = u^{\prime}(x) v(x) + u(x) v^{\prime}(x)

This indicates that both $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ must be evaluated for both the calculation of $f(x)$ and $f^{\prime}(x)$.

## Explain expression swell in the context of symbolic differentiation.

Expression swell occurs in symbolic differentiation when the resulting expressions for derivatives become exponentially longer than the original function. This happens due to redundant computations, where nested duplications of expressions grow in complexity, leading to longer evaluation times.

### Card 4

## Describe the structure and output function of a simple neural network with a single input $x$ and two layers, including necessary equations.

\begin{aligned}
& z = h(w_{1} x + b_{1}) \\
& y = h(w_{2} z + b_{2})
\end{aligned}
$$

where \( h(a) \) is the soft ReLU function: 

$$
\zeta(a) = \ln (1 + \exp (a))
$$

The overall function is then given by:

$$
y(x) = h(w_{2} h(w_{1} x + b_{1}) + b_{2})

## What is one advantage of using symbolic differentiation for evaluating gradients in machine learning models?

One advantage of symbolic differentiation is that it avoids human error in the manual derivation of backpropagation equations by automating the application of calculus rules, such as the chain rule. This ensures that gradients are calculated to machine precision.

### Card 6

## Considering a function $h(a)$ defined as $\ln (1 + \exp (a))$, evaluate $h(w_{1} x + b_{1})$ and $h(w_{2} z + b_{2})$ if $z = h(w_{1} x + b_{1})$.

For the given function \( h(a) = \ln(1 + \exp(a)) \):

First, evaluate the hidden unit activation \( z \):

$$
z = \ln(1 + \exp(w_{1} x + b_{1}))
$$

Then, substitute \( z \) into the output function \( y \):

$$
y = \ln(1 + \exp(w_{2} \ln(1 + \exp(w_{1} x + b_{1})) + b_{2}))
$$

This shows the nested structure often seen in neural network models.

## Explain the primary advantage of automatic differentiation over symbolic differentiation regarding expression complexity and efficiency.

Automatic differentiation is more efficient than symbolic differentiation as it avoids redundant evaluations of intermediate variables used in the forward propagation equations.

This reduces the complexity of expressions and boosts computational efficiency.

## Illustrate the concept of forward-mode automatic differentiation using intermediate variables.

Forward-mode automatic differentiation augments each intermediate variable $z_{i}$ with a 'tangent' variable $\dot{z}_{i}$, representing the value of some derivative of that variable. These tangent variables and associated code are generated during the evaluation of a function, such as a neural network's error function.

For example, if $z_1 = w_1 x + b_1$, then the tangent variable $\dot{z}_1$ could represent $\frac{\partial z_1}{\partial w_1}$ during the execution.

## Explain how automatic differentiation can handle control flow elements while symbolic differentiation cannot.

Unlike symbolic differentiation, automatic differentiation can deal with control flow elements such as branches, loops, recursion, and procedure calls. This is because it augments the execution code with additional derivative calculations rather than rewriting the entire mathematical expression. This flexibility allows it to be applied to more general programming constructs.

## Explain how the derivative of the function $f\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)$ can be evaluated via automatic differentiation, and outline the expression derived for $\dot{v}_{i}$.

In automatic differentiation, the code propagates tuples $(z_{i}, \dot{z}_{i})$ to evaluate variables and their derivatives in parallel. The derivative chain rule is used to automate the construction of gradient evaluation code. For a function such as

$$
f\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)=x_{1} x_{2}+\exp \left(x_{1} x_{2}\right)-\sin \left(x_{2}\right)
$$

we use primal ($v_i$) and tangent variables ($\dot{v}_i$). The expression for $\dot{v}_{i}$ based on the chain rule is:

$$
\dot{v}_{i}=\frac{\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{1}}=\sum_{j \in \mathrm{pa}(i)} \frac{\partial v_{j}}{\partial x_{1}} \frac{\partial v_{i}}{\partial v_{j}}=\sum_{j \in \mathrm{pa}(i)} \dot{v}_{j} \frac{\partial v_{i}}{\partial v_{j}}

What key features make this diagram useful for forward-mode automatic differentiation?

%

The evaluation trace diagram shows key features essential for forward-mode automatic differentiation, including nodes representing intermediate variables and their computations, as well as arrows depicting the flow of dependencies. Besides merely showing forward propagation for variable computation $(\left\{z_{i}\right\})$, the diagram also illustrates the concurrent propagation of tuples $(z_{i}, \dot{z}_{i})$ for simultaneous evaluation of variables and their derivatives. The elementary operators and their simple derivative formulas combined with the chain rule allow automatic generation and evaluation of gradients alongside primal variable computations.

## Explain how the tangent variables $\dot{v}_i$ are evaluated in terms of $x_1$ and $x_2$.

To evaluate the tangent variables in a function with two outputs, we input specific values for $x_1$ and $x_2$. Let's detail how the tangent variables are computed:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \dot{v}_{1}=1 \\
& \dot{v}_{2}=0 \\
& \dot{v}_{3}=v_{1} \dot{v}_{2}+\dot{v}_{1} v_{2} \\
& \dot{v}_{4}=\dot{v}_{2} \cos \left(v_{2}\right) \\
& \dot{v}_{5}=\dot{v}_{3} \exp \left(v_{3}\right) \\
& \dot{v}_{6}=\dot{v}_{3}-\dot{v}_{4} \\
& \dot{v}_{7}=\dot{v}_{5}+\dot{v}_{6}
\end{aligned}
$$

By numerically evaluating the tuples $\left(v_{i}, \dot{v}_{i}\right)$, we obtain $\dot{v}_{5}$, which is the required derivative.


- #differentiation, #tangents

## Describe the modified evaluation for the function with two outputs $f_1$ and $f_2$.

When the function has two outputs $f_1\left(x_1, x_2\right)$ and $f_2\left(x_1, x_2\right)$, the evaluation equations for the primal and tangent variables are extended. For $f_2$, given by:

$$
f_{2}\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)=\left(x_{1} x_{2}-\sin \left(x_{2}\right)\right) \exp \left(x_{1} x_{2}\right)
$$

The same forward pass can be used to compute both $\partial f_{1} / \partial x_{1}$ and $\partial f_{2} / \partial x_{1}$. However, to evaluate derivatives with respect to a different variable $x_{2}$, a new forward pass is required.


- #calculus, #differentiation

## What does a single pass of forward-mode automatic differentiation produce for a function with $D$ inputs and $K$ outputs?

For a function with $D$ inputs and $K$ outputs, a single pass of forward-mode automatic differentiation produces a single column of the $K \times D$ Jacobian matrix:

$$
\mathbf{J}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{D}} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial f_{K}}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_{K}}{\partial x_{D}}
\end{array}\right]
$$

Each forward pass calculates one column referring to derivatives with respect to a specific input variable.


- #differentiation, #jacobian

## How is the derivative $\partial f / \partial x_{1}$ evaluated?

To evaluate the derivative $\partial f / \partial x_{1}$, specific values for $x_1$ and $x_2$ are input into the code. The code then executes the evaluation of both primal and tangent equations to numerically compute the derivative by tracing tuples $\left(v_{i}, \dot{v}_{i}\right)$ until obtaining $\dot{v}_{5}$.


- #differentiation, #derivatives


## What is $\dot{v}_3$ in terms of $\dot{v}_{1}$ and $\dot{v}_{2}$?

The tangent variable $\dot{v}_3$ is defined as:

$$
\dot{v}_{3} = v_{1} \dot{v}_{2} + \dot{v}_{1} v_{2}
$$

Where $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are primal variables and $\dot{v}_{1}$, $\dot{v}_{2}$ are tangent variables.


- #differentiation, #tangents

## In forward-mode automatic differentiation, why must a separate forward pass be run to evaluate derivatives with respect to different input variables?

In forward-mode automatic differentiation, a separate forward pass must be run to evaluate derivatives with respect to different input variables because each forward pass computes only one column of the Jacobian matrix. To fill all columns (each corresponding to different input variables), each pass needs specific values, thus requiring individual execution.

- #differentiation, #jacobian



## Understanding the Evaluation Trace

What is represented by each node and edge in the computational graph for the function with two outputs $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ shown in the image?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_4388dae6329660fd2fabg-1.jpg?height=300&width=785&top_left_y=226&top_left_x=858)

%

The nodes represent intermediate variables $v_i$ or outputs $f_i$, and the edges represent the flow of computation. Specifically:

- $ v_1 = x_1 $
- $ v_2 = x_2 $
- $ v_3 = v_1 v_2 $
- $ v_4 = \sin(v_2) $
- $ v_5 = \exp(v_3) $
- $ v_6 = v_3 - v_4 $
- $ v_7 = v_5 + v_6 $ (output $f_1$)
- $ v_8 = v_5 v_6 $ (output $f_2$)

The graph helps in both function evaluation and derivative calculation using automatic differentiation.

## Automatic Differentiation

How is the derivative $\partial f / \partial x_1$ evaluated in the context of the given computational graph for functions $f_1$ and $f_2$?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_4388dae6329660fd2fabg-1.jpg?height=300&width=785&top_left_y=226&top_left_x=858)

%

The derivative $\partial f / \partial x_1$ is evaluated by executing the primal equations (based on the forward mode of automatic differentiation) and then sequentially computing the tangent variables $\dot{v_i}$ as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \dot{v}_{1}=1 \\
& \dot{v}_{2}=0 \\
& \dot{v}_{3}=v_{1} \dot{v}_{2}+\dot{v}_{1} v_{2} \\
& \dot{v}_{4}=\dot{v}_{2} \cos \left(v_{2}\right) \\
& \dot{v}_{5}=\dot{v}_{3} \exp \left(v_{3}\right) \\
& \dot{v}_{6}=\dot{v}_{3}-\dot{v}_{4} \\
& \dot{v}_{7}=\dot{v}_{5}+\dot{v}_{6}
\end{aligned}
$$

The derivative $\dot{v}_5$ is numerically evaluated as the final result after processing these tangent variables.

What does the computational graph in the image represent?

%

The computational graph in the image represents the sequence of operations for a function with two outputs, $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$, based on two input variables, $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. The intermediate variables are computed as follows:

\begin{align*}
v_{1} &= x_{1} \\
v_{2} &= x_{2} \\
v_{3} &= v_{1}v_{2} \\
v_{4} &= \sin(v_{2}) \\
v_{5} &= \exp(v_{3}) \\
v_{6} &= v_{3} - v_{4} \\
v_{7} &= v_{5} + v_{6} \quad \text{(corresponds to output } f_{1}) \\
v_{8} &= v_{5}v_{6} \quad \text{(corresponds to output } f_{2})
\end{align*}

The edges between the nodes indicate the flow of input values $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ through various operations, ultimately leading to the function outputs $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$. This graph can be used for evaluating the function and its derivatives using automatic differentiation algorithms.

## Automatic differentiation in computational graphs

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_4388dae6329660fd2fabg-1.jpg?height=300&width=785&top_left_y=226&top_left_x=858)

How are the tangent variables $\dot{v}_{i}$ evaluated in automatic differentiation for the given computational graph?

%

The tangent variables $\dot{v}_{i}$ are evaluated using the following sequential equations derived from the computational graph:

\begin{aligned}
& \dot{v}_{1}=1 \\
& \dot{v}_{2}=0 \\
& \dot{v}_{3}=v_{1} \dot{v}_{2}+\dot{v}_{1} v_{2} \\
& \dot{v}_{4}=\dot{v}_{2} \cos(v_{2}) \\
& \dot{v}_{5}=\dot{v}_{3} \exp(v_{3}) \\
& \dot{v}_{6}=\dot{v}_{3} - \dot{v}_{4} \\
& \dot{v}_{7}=\dot{v}_{5} + \dot{v}_{6}
\end{aligned}

To evaluate the derivative $\partial f / \partial x_{1}$, specific values of $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are used as inputs, and the code executes both the primal and tangent equations, numerically updating the tuples $(v_{i}, \dot{v}_{i})$ sequentially until obtaining $\dot{v}_{5}$, which is the required derivative.

- #machine-learning, #algorithms, #automatic-differentiation

### Compute Column $j$ of the Jacobian

To compute column $j$ of the Jacobian $\mathbf{J}$, we need to set specific initial conditions. Describe these conditions.

The initial conditions are set as $\dot{x}_{j}=1$ and $\dot{x}_{i}=0$ for $i \neq j$. This can be represented in vector form as $\dot{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{e}_{i}$, where $\mathbf{e}_{i}$ is the $i$-th unit vector.

- #math.analysis, #differentiation.jacobian

### Full Jacobian Matrix Computation

How many forward-mode passes are required to compute the full Jacobian matrix?

To compute the full Jacobian matrix, we need $D$ forward-mode passes, where $D$ is the dimension of the input vector.

- #math.analysis, #differentiation.jacobian

### Jacobian-Vector Product

How can the product of the Jacobian $\mathbf{J}$ with a vector $\mathbf{r}$ be efficiently computed?

The product of the Jacobian with a vector $\mathbf{r}=\left(r_{1}, \ldots, r_{D}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}$ can be computed in a single forward pass by setting $\dot{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{r}$.

$$
\mathbf{J} \mathbf{r} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{D}} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial f_{K}}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_{K}}{\partial x_{D}}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
r_{1} \\
\vdots \\
r_{D}
\end{array}\right]
$$

In what kind of networks is forward-mode automatic differentiation most efficient?

Forward-mode automatic differentiation is most efficient for networks with a few inputs and many outputs, such that $K \gg D$.

- #algorithms, #differentiation.forward-mode

### Reverse-Mode Automatic Differentiation

Define the adjoint variables $\bar{v}_{i}$ used in reverse-mode automatic differentiation.
The adjoint variables $\bar{v}_{i}$ are defined as:

$$
\bar{v}_{i} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial v_{i}}
$$

These variables can be evaluated sequentially using the chain rule.

- #algorithms, #differentiation.reverse-mode

### Sequential Evaluation of Adjoint Variables

How are the adjoint variables $\bar{v}_{i}$ evaluated in reverse-mode automatic differentiation?

The adjoint variables are evaluated sequentially starting with the output and working backwards using the chain rule of calculus:

$$
\bar{v}_{i} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial v_{i}} = \sum_{j \in \operatorname{ch}(i)} \frac{\partial f}{\partial v_{j}} \frac{\partial v_{j}}{\partial v_{i}} = \sum_{j \in \operatorname{ch}(i)} \bar{v}_{j} \frac{\partial v_{j}}{\partial v_{i}}
$$

Here, $\operatorname{ch}(i)$ denotes the children of node $i$ in the evaluation trace graph.

& \bar{v}_{1}=\bar{v}_{3} v_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Compute $\bar{v}_{6}$ given the value of $\bar{v}_{7}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \bar{v}_{7}=1 \\
& \bar{v}_{6}=\bar{v}_{7}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

Since $\bar{v}_{6}$ is directly based on $\bar{v}_{7}$, we have:

$$ \bar{v}_{6} = \bar{v}_{7} = 1 $$

Thus, $\bar{v}_{6}$ is also $1$.

## Explain why reverse mode is often more memory intensive than forward mode.

Why is reverse mode automatic differentiation often more memory-intensive compared to forward mode automatic differentiation?

---

Reverse mode automatic differentiation is more memory-intensive because all of the intermediate primal variables must be stored so that they will be available when evaluating the adjoint variables during the backward pass. In contrast, forward mode computes primal and tangent variables together during the forward pass, enabling some variables to be discarded after use.

These six cards offer comprehensive coverage of the provided paper chunk, encapsulating essential concepts and equations for a deep understanding of automatic differentiation and backpropagation in neural networks.

## Derivation of Backpropagation Algorithm

Describe the term 'backpropagation' as used in this book.

In this book, 'backpropagation' specifically refers to the computational procedure used in the numerical evaluation of derivatives such as the gradient of the error function with respect to the weights and biases of a neural network. This is distinct from the broader use of the term, which may refer to the network architecture or the end-to-end training procedure.

- #neural-networks, #gradient-descent.backpropagation


## Backpropagation Application

Identify the derivatives that the backpropagation procedure can be applied to evaluate.

The backpropagation procedure can be applied to evaluate important derivatives such as the Jacobian and Hessian matrices, in addition to the gradient of the error function with respect to the weights and biases of a neural network.

- #neural-networks, #mathematics.derivatives


## Evaluation of Error Functions

What is the general form of error functions of practical interest, particularly those defined by maximum likelihood?

Many error functions of practical interest, particularly those defined by maximum likelihood for a set of i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) data, comprise a sum of terms, one for each data point in the training set:
$$
E(\mathbf{w})=\sum_{n=1}^{N} E_{n}(\mathbf{w})
$$
where $E(\mathbf{w})$ is the total error and $E_n(\mathbf{w})$ is the error for the $n$-th data point.

- #error-functions, #statistics.maximum-likelihood


## Gradient Evaluation for Stochastic Gradient Descent

Explain why evaluating $\nabla E_{n}(\mathbf{w})$ for one term in the error function is useful.

Evaluating $\nabla E_{n}(\mathbf{w})$ for one term in the error function is useful because it can be used directly for stochastic gradient descent. The results can also be accumulated over a set of training data points for batch or minibatch methods.

$E(\mathbf{w})=\sum_{n=1}^{N} E_{n}(\mathbf{w})$

- #gradient-descent, #mathematics.gradient-evaluation


## Linear Model Output Equation

Provide the equation that defines the outputs $y_k$ as linear combinations of the input variables $x_i$.

The outputs $y_{k}$ are linear combinations of the input variables $x_{i}$, defined by the equation:
$$
y_{k}=\sum_{i} w_{k i} x_{i}
$$
where $w_{ki}$ represents the weights.

- #linear-models, #mathematics.equations


## Sum-of-Squares Error Function

What is the form of the sum-of-squares error function for a particular input data point $n$?

For a particular input data point $n$, the sum-of-squares error function is given by:
$$
E_{n}=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{k}\left(y_{n k}-t_{n k}\right)^{2}
$$
where $y_{nk}$ is the predicted output and $t_{nk}$ is the target output for the $n$-th data point.

## Derivation of Gradient with Respect to Weight in Feed-Forward Networks

Given the gradient of the error function with respect to a weight $w_{j i}$:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}=\left(y_{n j}-t_{n j}\right) x_{n i}
$$

Explain the interpretation of this gradient in terms of 'local' computations involving 'error signals' and input variables in the context of feed-forward networks.

%
This gradient can be interpreted as a 'local' computation involving the product of:

1. **Error Signal**: $y_{n j}-t_{n j}$, which is the difference between the predicted output ($y_{n j}$) and the target value ($t_{n j}$) associated with the output end of the link $w_{j i}$.
2. **Input Variable**: $x_{n i}$, which is the input associated with the input end of the link $w_{j i}$.

Thus, the gradient tells us how much a small change in the weight $w_{j i}$ will affect the total error based on the current prediction error and the input to the network.

### Card 2
## Activation Calculation in Feed-Forward Networks

Given the general form of a weighted sum for a feed-forward network unit:

$$
a_{j}=\sum_{i} w_{j i} z_{i}
$$

Describe what $z_{i}$ represents in the context of this equation.

%
In this equation:

- $z_{i}$ represents the activation of another unit or input unit that sends a connection to unit $j$.
- $w_{j i}$ is the weight associated with that connection.

The summation $\sum_{i} w_{j i} z_{i}$ represents the total input to unit $j$ (known as pre-activation), which will then be transformed by a nonlinear activation function $h(\cdot)$ to produce the activation $z_{j}$ of unit $j$.

- #neural-networks, #feed-forward-networks, #activation-computation

### Card 3
## Nonlinear Activation Function in Feed-Forward Networks

Given the transformation by a nonlinear activation function:

$$
z_{j}=h\left(a_{j}\right)
$$

What role does the activation function $h(\cdot)$ play in this transformation, and why is it important?

%
The activation function $h(\cdot)$:

- **Role**: It transforms the pre-activation value $a_{j}$, which is a weighted sum of inputs, into the activation value $z_{j}$ of unit $j$.
- **Importance**: It introduces nonlinearity into the model, allowing the network to approximate complex, non-linear functions. Without a nonlinear activation function, the entire network would behave as a linear model regardless of the number of layers.

- #neural-networks, #feed-forward-networks, #activation-functions

### Card 4
## Forward Propagation in Feed-Forward Networks

Explain the process of forward propagation in feed-forward networks and how it relates to equations (8.5) and (8.6):

$$
a_{j}=\sum_{i} w_{j i} z_{i}
$$

$$
z_{j}=h\left(a_{j}\right)
$$

%
Forward propagation is the process of computing the output of a neural network by sequentially applying two operations:

1. **Weighted Sum (Equation 8.5)**: Each unit computes a weighted sum of its inputs, $a_{j}=\sum_{i} w_{j i} z_{i}$.
2. **Activation Function (Equation 8.6)**: This sum is then passed through a nonlinear activation function, $z_{j}=h\left(a_{j}\right)$, to produce the activation of the unit.

The input data is thus propagated forward through the layers, from the input layer to the output layer, performing these computations at each unit.

### Card 5
## Derivation of Gradient Using Chain Rule in Feed-Forward Networks

Given the error function derivative in the context of weights:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}=\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial a_{j}} \frac{\partial a_{j}}{\partial w_{j i}}
$$

Explain the relevance of applying the chain rule for partial derivatives in this context.

%
Applying the chain rule for partial derivatives allows us to decompose the derivative of the error function $E_{n}$ with respect to the weight $w_{j i}$ into simpler components:

1. **$\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial a_{j}}$**: Captures how the error changes with respect to the pre-activation value $a_{j}$.
2. **$\frac{\partial a_{j}}{\partial w_{j i}}$**: Represents how the pre-activation value $a_{j}$ changes with respect to the weight $w_{j i}$.

This decomposition simplifies the process of calculating gradients in the context of backpropagation for training neural networks.

### Card 6
## Notation for Error Derivative in Feed-Forward Networks

Introduce and explain the notation:

$$
\delta_{j} \equiv \frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial a_{j}}
$$

%
The notation $\delta_{j}$ is introduced to simplify expressions involving the derivative of the error function $E_{n}$ with respect to the pre-activation value $a_{j}$. 

- **$\delta_{j}$**: Represents the sensitivity of the error with respect to the pre-activation of unit $j$, encapsulating how changes in $a_{j}$ affect the overall error. This helps in organizing and simplifying the backpropagation calculations in feed-forward networks.

Substituting $\partial a_{j} / \partial w_{ji} = z_i$ into the expression for $\partial E_n / \partial a_j$ and rearranging gives:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}=\delta_{j} z_{i}

## How is the error term $\delta_j$ for hidden units calculated using the chain rule?

The error term $\delta_j$ for hidden units is calculated using the chain rule for partial derivatives:

$$

$$

where the sum runs over all units $k$ to which unit $j$ sends connections.

- #backpropagation, #hidden-units

```markdown
## What is the backpropagation formula for the error term $\delta_j$ of a hidden unit?

Using the chain rule and definitions of $\delta$, we obtain the backpropagation formula for a hidden unit $j$:

$$
\delta_{j}=h^{\prime}\left(a_{j}\right) \sum_{k} w_{k j} \delta_{k}
$$

Here, $\delta_k$ are the error terms for units to which hidden unit $j$ connects, and $h'$ is the derivative of the activation function.

## In backpropagation, what does Equation (8.10) imply about calculating derivatives for weights?

Equation (8.10),

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}=\delta_{j} z_{i}
$$

implies that the required derivative can be obtained by multiplying the error term $\delta_j$ by the input $z_i$. This simplifies the calculation and indicates that it follows the same form as a simple linear model.

The image illustrates the concept of backpropagation in neural networks. It shows three nodes representing units in a network, where the central unit (with activation $z_j$) connects to two other units (with activations $z_i$ and $\delta_k$, $\delta_l$) via weighted connections. The forward pass of information, indicated by black arrows, moves from the $z_i$ node through the weight $w_{ji}$, processes in the $z_j$ node, and then moves outwards through the weights $w_{kj}$, $w_{lj}$. The red arrows represent the backward propagation of errors ($\delta$'s), which are used to adjust weights during the training phase.

%

Equation (8.10) in the context of backpropagation is:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}=\delta_{j} z_{i}
$$

This equation tells us that the derivative of the error $E_n$ with respect to the weight $w_{ji}$ is obtained by multiplying the value of $\delta$ for the unit at the output end of the weight by the value of $z$ for the unit at the input end of the weight (where $z=1$ for a bias). The derivation involves using partial derivatives $\frac{\partial a_{j}}{\partial w_{j i}}=z_{i}$ and substituting it into related expressions, confirming the form similar to that found for a simple linear model.

## Describe the forward propagation steps involved in the Backpropagation Algorithm.

In the Backpropagation Algorithm, forward propagation involves computing the activation of each unit in the network. This is done in two steps:

1. For each hidden and output unit $j$, compute the pre-activation $a_j$:

$$
a_{j} \leftarrow \sum_{i} w_{j i} z_{i}
$$

2. Apply the activation function $h(a)$ to obtain the output $z_j$ of each unit:

$$
z_{j} \leftarrow h\left(a_{j}\right)
$$

Here, $w_{j i}$ are the network parameters and $z_i$ represents the input or the output from a previous layer.

- #algorithms, #neural-networks.forward-propagation

  
## Explain how error evaluation is performed in the Backpropagation Algorithm.

In the Backpropagation Algorithm, the error evaluation step involves computing the error term $\delta_k$ for each output unit $k$. This is calculated as follows:

$$
\delta_{k} \leftarrow \frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial a_{k}}
$$

Here, $E_n$ is the error function for the input $\mathbf{x}_n$, and $a_k$ is the pre-activation of the output unit $k$.

- #algorithms, #neural-networks.error-evaluation

## How are the error derivatives $\left\{\partial E_{n} / \partial w_{j i}\right\}$ computed in the Backpropagation Algorithm?

The error derivatives $\left\{\partial E_{n} / \partial w_{j i}\right\}$ are computed during the backward propagation step by evaluating the derivatives recursively. The key steps are:

1. Compute $\delta_{j}$ for hidden units using:

$$
\delta_{j} \leftarrow h^{\prime}\left(a_{j}\right) \sum_{k} w_{k j} \delta_{k}
$$

2. Calculate the derivatives $\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}$ as:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}} \leftarrow \delta_{j} z_{i}
$$

Here, $\delta_j$ is the error term for each hidden unit $j$, and $w_{k j}$ are the network weights.

- #algorithms, #neural-networks.backward-propagation

## How is the total error derivative computed in batch methods for the Backpropagation Algorithm?

In batch methods, the derivative of the total error $E$ is computed by summing the derivatives over all data points in the batch or mini-batch. This is done as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{j i}}=\sum_{n} \frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}
$$

Here, $\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}$ is the derivative of the error for individual data point $n$, and the sum is taken over all data points in the batch.

- #algorithms, #neural-networks.batch-methods

## What role does the activation function $h(a)$ play in the Backpropagation Algorithm?

The activation function $h(a)$ plays a crucial role in the forward propagation step of the Backpropagation Algorithm. After computing the pre-activation $a_j$ for each unit $j$:

$$
a_{j} \leftarrow \sum_{i} w_{j i} z_{i}
$$

The activation function $h(a)$ is applied to $a_j$ to produce the output $z_j$:

$$
z_{j} \leftarrow h\left(a_{j}\right)
$$

The choice of activation function affects the non-linearity and expressiveness of the neural network.

- #algorithms, #neural-networks.activation-function

## Why is the summation performed differently in forward and backward propagation in the Backpropagation Algorithm?

In the Backpropagation Algorithm, the summation index differs between forward and backward propagation due to the flow of information:

- In forward propagation, the summation is done over the second index of $w_{j i}$:

$$
a_{j} \leftarrow \sum_{i} w_{j i} z_{i}
$$

- In backward propagation, the summation is done over the first index of $w_{k j}$:

$$
\delta_{j} \leftarrow h^{\prime}\left(a_{j}\right) \sum_{k} w_{k j}\delta_{k}
$$

This reflects the opposite directions of information flow in the two processes: forward through the network layers and backward through the same layers but in reverse.

- #algorithms, #neural-networks.propagation-summation

## Explain the activation functions for output and hidden units in the two-layer network example.

In the two-layer network example, the output units have linear activation functions, meaning that $y_k = a_k$. On the other hand, the hidden units use a sigmoidal activation function given by:

$$
h(a) \equiv \tanh (a)
$$

The derivative of this activation function is expressed as:

$$
h^{\prime}(a) = 1 - h(a)^2
$$

- #neural-networks.activation-functions, #deep-learning


## What is the error function used for the two-layer network example in backpropagation?

The error function used for a given data point $n$ in the two-layer network example is a sum-of-squares error function:

$$
E_n = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{K} (y_k - t_k)^2
$$

where $y_k$ is the activation of output unit $k$, and $t_k$ is the corresponding target value.

- #neural-networks.error-functions, #backpropagation

## Describe the forward propagation steps for the two-layer network.

The forward propagation for the two-layer network is performed using the following equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_j & = \sum_{i=0}^{D} w_{ji}^{(1)} x_i \\
z_j & = \tanh(a_j) \\
y_k & = \sum_{j=0}^{M} w_{kj}^{(2)} z_j
\end{aligned}
$$

where $D$ is the dimensionality of the input vector $\mathbf{x}$, and $M$ is the total number of hidden units. $x_0$ and $z_0$ are set to 1 to include bias parameters.

- #neural-networks.forward-propagation, #deep-learning

## How are the $\delta$'s for the output units calculated in backpropagation?

The $\delta$'s for the output units are calculated using the equation:

$$
\delta_k = y_k - t_k
$$

where $y_k$ is the output of unit $k$ and $t_k$ is the target value for that unit.

- #neural-networks.backpropagation, #deep-learning

## How are the $\delta$'s for the hidden units calculated in backpropagation?

The $\delta$'s for the hidden units are calculated by backpropagating the errors using:

$$
\delta_j = (1 - z_j^2) \sum_{k=1}^{K} w_{kj}^{(2)} \delta_k
$$

where $z_j$ is the activation of the hidden unit and $w_{kj}^{(2)}$ are the weights connecting hidden unit $j$ to output unit $k$.

- #neural-networks.backpropagation, #deep-learning

## Explain the utility of the derivative of the activation function $h(a) \equiv \tanh(a)$ in backpropagation.

A useful feature of the $\tanh(a)$ activation function is that its derivative can be expressed in a simple form:

$$
h^{\prime}(a) = 1 - h(a)^2
$$

This simplicity facilitates the calculation of the gradients needed for updating the weights in the backpropagation algorithm.

## Derivatives with respect to weights.

What are the derivatives of the error function $E_n$ with respect to the first-layer and second-layer weights?

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}^{(1)}}=\delta_{j} x_{i}, \quad \frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{k j}^{(2)}}=\delta_{k} z_{j}
$$

The derivatives with respect to the first-layer weights ($w_{ji}^{(1)}$) and second-layer weights ($w_{kj}^{(2)}$) are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}^{(1)}} = \delta_{j} x_{i}
$$

where $\delta_j$ is the error term for neuron $j$ in the first layer, and $x_i$ is the input to that neuron.

For the second-layer weights:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{k j}^{(2)}} = \delta_{k} z_{j}
$$

where $\delta_k$ is the error term for neuron $k$ in the second layer, and $z_j$ is the activation output from neuron $j$ in the first layer.

## Computational complexity of error function evaluation.

What is the computational complexity of evaluating the error function in a neural network with $W$ weights?

The computational complexity of evaluating the error function $E_n$ for a given input data point in a neural network is $\mathcal{O}(W)$ for sufficiently large $W$.

The complexity is due to:

1. Each term in the sum requires one multiplication and one addition.
2. The evaluation of activation functions contributes a small overhead.

Thus, the overall computational cost is dominated by the number of weights, which is $\mathcal{O}(W)$.

## Finite differences for derivatives.

Explain how finite differences can be used to approximate the derivatives of the error function $E_n$. What is the general expression?

Finite differences can be used to approximate the derivatives of the error function $E_n$ by perturbing each weight $w_{ji}$ in turn. The general expression is:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}=\frac{E_{n}\left(w_{j i}+\epsilon\right)-E_{n}\left(w_{j i}\right)}{\epsilon}+\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)
$$

where $\epsilon$ is a small perturbation.

## Accuracy improvement in finite differences.

How can the accuracy of finite differences be improved? What is the improved expression?

The accuracy of finite differences can be improved by using symmetrical central differences, which are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}=\frac{E_{n}\left(w_{j i}+\epsilon\right)-E_{n}\left(w_{j i}-\epsilon\right)}{2 \epsilon}+\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)
$$

The $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ corrections cancel out using this method.

## Numerical differentiation computational cost.

What is the computational cost of numerical differentiation compared to backpropagation in terms of $W$?

The computational cost of numerical differentiation is $\mathcal{O}(W^2)$, compared to $\mathcal{O}(W)$ for backpropagation.

In numerical differentiation:

- Each forward propagation requires $\mathcal{O}(W)$ steps.
- There are $W$ weights, each of which must be perturbed individually.

Thus, the overall cost is $\mathcal{O}(W^2)$.

- #numerical-differentiation, #computational-complexity

## Central differences in error computation.

Why are central differences more accurate than finite differences for computing numerical derivatives?

Central differences are more accurate than finite differences because the $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ corrections cancel out. 

Using symmetrical central differences:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial w_{j i}}=\frac{E_{n}\left(w_{j i}+\epsilon\right)-E_{n}\left(w_{j i}-\epsilon\right)}{2 \epsilon}+\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)
$$

In this method, the residual corrections are $\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)$, making it a higher-order and more accurate approximation compared to the standard finite differences approach.

## In numerical methods, how does the error behave with decreasing $\epsilon$ for finite differences?

%

For finite differences, the error initially decreases linearly with decreasing $\epsilon$. This linear decrease in error exhibits a power law behavior, as the slope of the line on a logarithmic scale is 1, meaning the error behaves like $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$. However, as $\epsilon$ becomes very small, the error reaches the limit of numerical round-off, and further reduction in $\epsilon$ leads to a noisy line where the error increases with decreasing $\epsilon$.

- #numerical-methods, #finite-differences

---

## In the given paper, what type of behavior does the central difference error exhibit with respect to decreasing $\epsilon$?

%

The error for central differences decreases quadratically with decreasing $\epsilon$ as indicated by the slope of the line being 2 on a logarithmic scale. This means that central difference error behaves like $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$. Therefore, central differences show a much smaller error compared to finite differences for small $\epsilon$.

## How is the Jacobian matrix $J_{ki}$ defined in the context of neural networks?

The Jacobian matrix $J_{ki}$, pertaining to neural networks, is defined by the elements given by the partial derivatives of the network outputs with respect to the inputs:

$$
J_{k i} \equiv \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}}
$$

Here, each derivative is evaluated with all other inputs held fixed.

## Explain the importance of the Jacobian matrix in systems with multiple distinct modules.

The Jacobian matrix is significant in systems composed of multiple distinct modules because it measures the local sensitivity of the outputs to changes in each of the input variables. Such systems can be built using fixed or learnable functions (linear or nonlinear) as long as they are differentiable. The matrix elements provide insight into how changes in inputs propagate through the system, which is especially useful for error minimization and sensitivity analysis.

- #systems-analysis, #jacobian-matrix

## In terms of minimizing an error function $E$ with respect to a parameter $w$ in a network, how is the derivative of $E$ expressed?

The derivative of the error function $E$ with respect to the parameter $w$ is expressed as:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial w}=\sum_{k, j} \frac{\partial E}{\partial y_{k}} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial z_{j}} \frac{\partial z_{j}}{\partial w}
$$

In this equation, the Jacobian matrix for the intermediate module (red module in Figure 8.3) appears as the middle term on the right-hand side. This breakdown of the derivative helps in understanding how changes in $w$ affect the overall error through the different layers of the network.

- #error-minimization, #neural-networks

## Why does the finite difference error initially decrease linearly on a logarithmic scale but eventually increase for very small $\epsilon$?

Initially, the finite difference error decreases linearly on a logarithmic scale because the slope of the error line is 1, showing a power law behavior of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$. However, for very small $\epsilon$, the effect of numerical round-off errors becomes significant and causes the error to increase again, showing increased noise and deviation from the expected linear decrease pattern.

% 

Based on the image and associated text, what is the main advantage of using central differences over finite differences for numerical gradient computation?

%

The main advantage of using central differences over finite differences, as depicted in the image, is that central differences result in a much smaller error overall. Specifically, the error associated with central differences behaves according to the order of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$, demonstrating a quadratic relationship between the error and the step size, as opposed to the linear error in finite differences. This makes central differences a more accurate method, especially when the step size becomes very small.

%

Explain the relationship between the step size $\epsilon$ and numerical round-off errors in the context of finite differences for gradient computation.

%

In the context of finite differences for gradient computation, as the step size $\epsilon$ decreases, the error in the numerical computation initially decreases linearly on a logarithmic scale. However, at some point, the evaluated gradient reaches the limit of numerical round-off, leading to a noisy line where the error actually increases with decreasing $\epsilon$. This phenomenon implies that too small of a step size can degrade the accuracy of the gradient computation due to numerical round-off errors.

%
How does the error in numerical gradient computation behave for central differences as the step size $\epsilon$ decreases?

**Back:**

For the central differences method, the error is much smaller compared to finite differences, and it exhibits a quadratic relationship with the step size, $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$. This means that as $\epsilon$ decreases, the error initially decreases rapidly and forms a slope of 2 on a log-log plot, before numerical round-off errors begin to dominate.

%
What happens to the error in the finite differences method when the step size $\epsilon$ becomes very small?

**Back:**

In the finite differences method, as the step size $\epsilon$ becomes very small, the error initially decreases linearly on a log-log scale. However, once it reaches the limit of numerical round-off errors, further reduction in $\epsilon$ leads to increased noise and an overall increase in error. This shows that there is an optimal step size that minimizes error before round-off errors dominate.

## Jacobian Matrix for Small Perturbations

Explain the significance of the Jacobian matrix evaluating small perturbations in a neural network and write the related equation.
%
The Jacobian matrix helps determine how small changes in the input $\Delta x_i$ affect changes in the output $\Delta y_k$. This effect can be captured by the equation:

$$
\Delta y_{k} \simeq \sum_{i} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} \Delta x_{i}
$$

Here, $\frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}}$ represents the partial derivative of the output $y_k$ with respect to the input $x_i$, indicating how sensitive $y_k$ is to changes in $x_i$. This relation is valid only when the changes $\left|\Delta x_{i}\right|$ are small, ensuring that the system behaves approximately linearly around the operating point.

- #neural-networks.jacobian, #error-propagation, #partial-derivatives

## Influence of Nonlinearity on Jacobian Matrix Elements

How does nonlinearity in the network mapping influence the Jacobian matrix?

%
In a trained neural network, the mapping from inputs to outputs is generally nonlinear. This nonlinearity makes the elements of the Jacobian matrix dependent on the particular input vector used, meaning they are not constants but vary with the input. Thus, the Jacobian matrix needs to be re-evaluated for each new input vector, and the relation $\Delta y_{k} = \sum_{i} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} \Delta x_{i}$ is only valid for small perturbations of the inputs.

- #neural-networks, #nonlinearity, #jacobian-matrix

## Element of the Jacobian Matrix

Write down the expression for an element $J_{ki}$ of the Jacobian matrix using partial derivatives and weights.

%
An element $J_{k i}$ of the Jacobian matrix can be expressed as:

$$
J_{k i}=\frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} = \sum_{j} w_{j i} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial a_{j}}
$$

This expression is derived by factoring the change in $y_k$ with respect to $x_i$ through an intermediate layer $a_j$, where $w_{ji}$ represents the weight of connection from input $i$ to unit $j$.

- #neural-networks, #jacobian, #partial-derivatives

## Recursive Formula for Derivatives

Provide and explain the recursive backpropagation formula for the derivatives $\partial y_{k} / \partial a_{j}$ in a neural network.

%
The recursive backpropagation formula for the derivatives $\partial y_{k} / \partial a_{j}$ in a neural network is given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial a_{j}} & = \sum_{l} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial a_{l}} \frac{\partial a_{l}}{\partial a_{j}} \\
& = h^{\prime}\left(a_{j}\right) \sum_{l} w_{l j} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial a_{l}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $h^{\prime}\left(a_{j}\right)$ denotes the derivative of the activation function with respect to $a_j$, and $w_{lj}$ represents the weight between units $j$ and $l$. This formula helps in propagating the derivatives backward through the network.

## Initial Derivatives for Output Units

What is the initial value of the derivative $\partial y_{k} / \partial a_{l}$ for linear output units? 

Define the related variable $\delta_{kl}$.

%
For linear output units, the initial value of the derivative $\partial y_{k} / \partial a_{l}$ is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial a_{l}} = \delta_{k l}
$$

Here, $\delta_{k l}$ is the Kronecker delta, which equals 1 if $k = l$ and 0 otherwise. This indicates that the derivative of the output $y_k$ with respect to its corresponding activation $a_l$ is 1, and zero for all other activations.

## Propagation Through Trained Network

Describe how errors are propagated through a network using the Jacobian matrix.

%
The errors at the outputs can be traced back to the inputs using the Jacobian matrix through the relation:

$$
\Delta y_{k} \simeq \sum_{i} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} \Delta x_{i}
$$

In this equation, $\frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}}$ represents the elements of the Jacobian matrix, which captures how a small change in input $\Delta x_i$ affects the output $\Delta y_k$. By backpropagating this way, one can estimate contributions of input perturbations to output errors.

## How is the Jacobian matrix used in a modular deep learning architecture for error propagation?

%

In a modular deep learning architecture, the Jacobian matrix is used to backpropagate error signals from the outputs through to earlier modules. This error propagation can be expressed with

$$
\Delta y_{k} \simeq \sum_{i} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} \Delta x_{i},
$$

assuming that the $\left|\Delta x_{i}\right|$ are small.

## What assumption must hold true for the relation $\Delta y_{k} \simeq \sum_{i} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} \Delta x_{i}$ in the context of the Jacobian matrix?

%

The assumption that must hold true is that the perturbations $\left|\Delta x_{i}\right|$ are small. Additionally, since the network's mapping is nonlinear, the elements of the Jacobian matrix are not constants but depend on the specific input vector used, necessitating re-evaluation of the Jacobian for each new input vector.

## 

Illustrate how a modular deep learning architecture utilizes the Jacobian matrix to backpropagate error signals from the outputs to early modules. Provide the mathematical relation used.

%

The modular deep learning architecture uses the Jacobian matrix to backpropagate error signals by estimating the contribution of inputs $\Delta x_i$ to the errors at the outputs, $\Delta y_k$, through the relation:

$$
\Delta y_{k} \simeq \sum_{i} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} \Delta x_{i}
$$

This assumes that the $\left|\Delta x_{i}\right|$ are small. Elements of the Jacobian matrix depend on the particular input vector, and the Jacobian must be re-evaluated for each new input vector.

- #neural-networks, #deep-learning.jacobian, #backpropagation

## 

Explain the validity and necessity of re-evaluating the Jacobian matrix for each new input vector in a nonlinear network mapping.

%

In nonlinear network mapping, re-evaluating the Jacobian matrix for each new input vector is necessary because the elements of the Jacobian matrix depend on the particular input vector. Thus, the matrix elements are not constants and will change with different inputs. The relation

$$
\Delta y_{k} \simeq \sum_{i} \frac{\partial y_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} \Delta x_{i}
$$

is valid only for small perturbations of the inputs, reinforcing the need for frequent re-evaluation.
