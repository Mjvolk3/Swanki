For the given classification task, which loss function is used and how is model performance evaluated? Additionally, what are the ROC-AUC values for the training and validation sets after 100 epochs?

%

For this classification task, cross-entropy is used as the loss function. Model performance is evaluated using the area under the receiver operating curve (ROC-AUC). After training for 100 epochs, the ROC-AUC is $82.5\%$ on the training set and $73.0\%$ on the validation set.

## Introduction to graph isomorphism challenge demonstrated in figure

What problem related to graph isomorphism is demonstrated in the provided diagram, and how does a standard graph neural network (GNN) based on the Weisfeiler-Leman test fail in this context?

%

The diagram illustrates a challenge in graph isomorphism, specifically how a standard graph neural network (GNN) modeled after the Weisfeiler-Leman test might fail to distinguish between graphs. The two graphs shown on the left are considered equal by the GNN despite one having an additional node. When represented in blue circles, the GNN perceives the graphs as equal, even though one clearly has an extra gray node. This indicates the limitations of some GNNs in differentiating graph structures when graph isomorphism tasks are involved.
