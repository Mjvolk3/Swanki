Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can apply to diverse fields:
- **Knowledge Graphs**: GNNs can be used to model complex relationships in a biomedical knowledge graph, such as those between proteins, drugs, viruses, and diseases. These models can predict unknown relationships or effects of interventions.
- **Molecular Property Prediction**: GNNs can be employed for tasks like quantum property prediction, where the structure of molecules (represented as graphs) is used for predicting molecular properties.

The biomedical knowledge graph depicts entities and relationships among:
- **Entities**: 
  - Proteins (yellow; e.g., "SARS-CoV-2 protease," "Spike protein")
  - Viruses (pink/red; e.g., "SARS-CoV," "SARS-CoV-2")
  - Drugs (green; e.g., "Molnupiravir," "Remdesivir," "Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir")
  - Symptoms/Diseases (blue; e.g., "COVID-19," "Pneumonia")

- **Relationships**: 
  - Arrows/lines indicating interactions such as "binds to," "contains," "inhibits," "treats," "causes," highlighting the interconnected nature of biomedical data, especially relevant to COVID-19 treatment and understanding.
