Why are molecular fingerprints sometimes preferred over Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for molecular property prediction tasks?

%

For certain molecular property prediction tasks, molecular fingerprints offer better performance due to their ability to capture specific features that GNNs might not efficiently represent. The effectiveness of GNNs can be limited by both technical and data constraints, leading to inaccuracies, particularly in the context of biological phenomena like activity or toxicity assessments.

What is the role of graph neural networks (GNNs) in drug discovery and quantum property prediction?

%

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are used to predict quantum properties, which can significantly reduce the time required for simulations compared to traditional methods. GNNs also play a vital role in drug repurposing and discovery by integrating multidisciplinary data into knowledge graphs, thus informing decision-making in these domains.
