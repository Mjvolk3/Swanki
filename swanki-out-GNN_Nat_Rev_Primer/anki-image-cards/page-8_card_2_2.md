Describe the primary application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in biomedical knowledge graphs as exemplified in Fig. 4a.

%

The primary application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in biomedical knowledge graphs, as exemplified in Fig. 4a, is to model the different types of interactions between entities such as proteins, drugs, viruses, and diseases. This allows for the integration of data from various modalities including drugs, phenotypes, diseases, disease exposure, genes, or pathways, each characterized by their unique types of relations.

Explain how GNNs outperform traditional quantum simulations in molecular property prediction, as discussed in Fig. 4b.

%

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) outperform traditional quantum simulations in molecular property prediction by significantly reducing computational time. While accurate quantum simulations to estimate properties can take hours, GNNs have demonstrated the ability to predict quantum properties in fractions of a second. They use molecular structures as input, examining 3D structural features such as atom-to-atom distances and angles to predict properties like potential energy ($E$) and vibrational mode frequency ($\omega_{0}$).
