Important data symmetries for GNNs include properties that are permutation and rotation invariant or equivariant. For example, the energy of a molecule is both translation and rotation invariant as it does not depend on its frame of reference.

## Why is the graph isomorphism problem a challenge for standard GNNs?

Standard GNNs face a challenge in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs because they operate on local structures that cannot always reflect the global topology of a graph. This limitation is evident as standard GNNs cannot differentiate between non-isomorphic graphs that do not have distinct local features.
