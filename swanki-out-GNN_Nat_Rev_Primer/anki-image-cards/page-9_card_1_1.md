Describe the process illustrated in the diagram for fragment-based molecular generation.

%

The diagram illustrates a process of fragment-based molecular generation, highlighting how complex molecular structures are constructed by sequentially adding smaller molecular fragments or subgraphs. This involves:

1. Starting with an initial molecular structure.
2. Selecting a new fragment to add, depicted in a darker shade.
3. Identifying possible connection points (dotted lines and enclosed dashes) on the existing structure.
4. Integrating the new fragment at the selected connection point, thereby expanding the molecular structure.
5. Iteratively considering further portions for additional extensions.
6. Adding different fragments, depicted in vibrant colors, to various parts of the base structure.

This iterative approach potentially uses rules or constraints to ensure the resulting molecules possess the desired properties, aiding in applications like drug discovery.

## Standardized benchmarks for data-driven life science applications

Which standardized benchmarks are mentioned in the context of data acquisition for life science applications, and why is the acquisition of data challenging in this field?

%

The text mentions standardized benchmarks like $\mathrm{OGB}^{12}$ (Open Graph Benchmark) and Therapeutic Data Commons. Data acquisition in life science applications is challenging because it is more expensive and diverse compared to fields like computer vision and natural language processing, where scraping the internet often suffices for data collection. This highlights the importance of collating and open-sourcing more data, as well as developing methods effective for low-data regimes.
