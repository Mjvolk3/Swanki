What role do standardized benchmarks play in advancing life science applications, according to the associated text?

%

Standardized benchmarks like $\mathrm{OGB}^{12}$ and Therapeutic Data Commons ${ }^{97}$ are crucial for life science applications as they drive reproducibility by requiring code to reproduce results to be published. They also highlight the need for collating and open-sourcing more data, and the development of methods that work well in low data regimes, due to the high cost and diverse nature of data acquisition in life sciences compared to fields like computer vision or natural language processing.

Describe the process of fragment-based molecular generation as depicted in the image.

%

The image depicts the fragment-based molecular generation process as follows:
1. Start with an initial molecular structure.
2. Choose a new fragment to add, highlighted in a darker shade.
3. Identify possible connection points with dotted lines and enclosed dashes.
4. Select a connection point and integrate the new fragment into the structure.
5. Continue expanding the structure with more fragments.
6. Consider additional parts of the molecule for further extensions.
7. Add different molecular fragments to enhance the base structure iteratively.

This iterative approach systematically constructs molecules, potentially guided by rules or constraints to ensure desired properties, aiding in applications like drug discovery.
