What does the scaffold split in the depicted graph neural network model aim to evaluate?

%

The scaffold split aims to evaluate the model's capability to generalize to a test distribution that is substantially different from the training data. This ensures that no molecules in the training data have the same scaffold as those in the test data, thus mimicking real-world application scenarios.

Explain the significance of the purple and blue curves in the image of the 2D embedding of molecules.

%

The purple curve represents the training data, while the blue curve represents the test data. These curves indicate that the model has been trained and tested on different subsets of the data to evaluate how well it can predict molecular activity in scenarios where the test data is distinct from the training set.
