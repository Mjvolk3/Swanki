Nodes in a graph neural network are typically represented by considering their neighbors, which provides more informative representations than considering random nodes. This concept, known as the locality inductive bias, underlies the message-passing mechanisms in graph neural networks.

## What does the scaffold split in graph neural network evaluations ensure?

The scaffold split in graph neural network evaluations ensures that the molecules in the training data do not share the same scaffold as those in the test data. This method assesses the model's ability to generalize to a test distribution that is significantly different from the training data, which is crucial for real-world applications.
