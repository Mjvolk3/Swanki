The diagram in the image illustrates a biomedical knowledge graph showing different types of interactions between entities such as proteins, drugs, viruses, and diseases. The specific relationships depicted include:

- Proteins like "SARS-CoV-2 protease" and the "Spike protein"
- Viruses "SARS-CoV" and "SARS-CoV-2"
- Drugs such as "Molnupiravir" and "Remdesivir," including a combination drug "Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir"
- A symptom "COVID-19" and a disease manifestation "Pneumonia"

Different colored boxes represent different categories of entities: 
- Yellow for proteins
- Pink or red for viruses
- Green for drugs
- Various shades of blue for symptoms and diseases

Directed edges (arrows and lines) between boxes indicate interactions or relationships like "binds to," "contains," "inhibits," "treats," "causes," etc.

This graph encodes complex relationships between biomedical entities and can be used in machine learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), for predicting unknown relationships or the effects of interventions.

How can Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) be applied to the diagram shown in the image?

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be applied to the biomedical knowledge graph in the diagram to predict molecular properties and unknown relationships between the entities such as proteins, drugs, viruses, and diseases. For example:

- GNNs can predict how new drugs might interact with proteins involved in viral replication.
- They can identify potential new treatments by discovering previously unknown interactions between existing drugs and the disease's proteins or symptoms.

The graph shown in the image encodes interactions like "binds to," "contains," "inhibits," "treats," "causes," etc., which can serve as input for GNN algorithms to make these predictions by learning from the patterns and structures represented in the relationships between nodes (entities).
