The representation $h_i^{(l)}$ of node $i$ at layer $\ell$ is updated by the following operation:

$$
h_{i}^{(l+1)} = \operatorname{ReLU}\left(W^{(l+1)}\left(h_{i}^{(l)} + \sum_{j} h_{j}^{(l)}\right)\right)
$$

The steps in predicting molecular properties using a GNN, as illustrated in the image, are:

1. **Encode Features**: Convert a SMILES string of a molecule into a graph, representing each atom as a node with initial feature vectors.
2. **Layer 1**: Perform the first message-passing step where nodes update their representations by receiving messages from neighboring nodes.
3. **Layer 2**: Continue message-passing with nodes incorporating information from a two-hop neighborhood.
4. **Sum Pooling**: Aggregate node representations into a single vector by summing them, representing the entire molecule.
5. **Classification**: Utilize a feedforward neural network to process the aggregated vector and output a logit to classify the molecule's property (e.g., HIV inhibition).
