The energy of a molecule is invariant under permutations and rotations of its reference frame. This invariance means that regardless of how the molecule is oriented in space, its energy remains the same. This property is crucial for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to effectively model molecular structures.

## What problem do standard Graph Neural Networks face when distinguishing graph structures?

Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face difficulty in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs that have identical node features and adjacency structures. This challenge is known as the graph isomorphism problem, where GNNs might incorrectly treat different graph structures as identical.
