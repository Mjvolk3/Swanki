How do Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) contribute to molecular property prediction in the context of drug discovery and repurposing?

%

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) efficiently predict quantum properties of molecules, significantly reducing simulation times. They are utilized in drug discovery and repurposing by integrating multidisciplinary data into knowledge graphs that inform decision-making. However, GNNs are not universally the best option for all tasks, and molecular fingerprints can sometimes offer superior performance for specific molecular property predictions.

What are the limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in molecular property prediction tasks?

%

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are state-of-the-art for many tasks involving graph-structured data, they present several technical and data limitations that make them not universally optimal. For some molecular property prediction tasks, molecular fingerprints can offer better performance, as GNNs' predictive accuracy can be compromised by the quality and complexity of the data used.
