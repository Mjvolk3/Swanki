Explain the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the context of knowledge graphs in biomedical applications.

%

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in biomedical applications are used to analyze and predict interactions within knowledge graphs, where nodes represent entities such as proteins, drugs, viruses, or diseases. By integrating data from various modalities (e.g., drugs, genes, diseases), GNNs can infer unknown relations, such as the potential repurposing of existing drugs to treat new diseases. This approach leverages the connections between different biomedical data types to enable comprehensive analysis and prediction.

Discuss the advantage of using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for molecular property prediction over traditional quantum simulations.

%

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer significant advantages for molecular property prediction over traditional quantum simulations. While traditional quantum simulations may take hours to estimate properties like potential energy ($E$) and vibrational mode frequency ($\omega_0$), GNNs can perform these predictions in fractions of a second. This computational efficiency stems from the GNN's ability to process structural features of molecules, such as atom-to-atom distances and angles, rapidly and accurately.
