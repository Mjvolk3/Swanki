The mathematical operation to update the representation \( h_{i}^{(l)} \) of node \( i \) at layer \( \ell \) is:

$$
h_{i}^{(l+1)}=\operatorname{ReLU}\left(W^{(l+1)}\left(h_{i}^{(l)}+\sum_{j} h_{j}^{(l)}\right)\right)

%
The Graph Neural Network (GNN) predicts HIV inhibition following these steps:

1. **Encode features**: Convert a SMILES string of a molecule into a graph where each atom is a node with encoded features.
2. **Layer 1**: A node receives messages from neighboring nodes and updates its representation.
3. **Layer 2**: The same node receives messages from its neighbors, including those that received messages in the previous layer.
4. **Sum pooling**: Aggregate the representations of all nodes into a single vector by summing them.
5. **Classification**: Use a feedforward neural network to process the aggregated vector and output a single logit to classify HIV inhibition potential.
