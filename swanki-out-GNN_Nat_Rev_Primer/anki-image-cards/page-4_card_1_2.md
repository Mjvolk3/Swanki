How is the performance of the classification model evaluated, and what were the results after 100 epochs on the training and validation sets?

%

The performance of the classification model is evaluated using the area under the receiver operating curve (ROC-AUC). After 100 epochs, the ROC-AUC was $82.5\%$ on the training set and $73.0\%$ on the validation set.

## Explanation of graph isomorphism challenges with GNNs

What does the provided image illustrate about the limitations of standard graph neural networks (GNNs) in graph isomorphism tasks?

%

The image illustrates that a standard graph neural network (GNN) modeled after the Weisfeiler-Leman test might fail to distinguish between structurally different graphs. Despite one graph having an additional node, the GNN perceives the graphs as equal due to its limitations in handling certain graph isomorphism tasks.
