What properties of molecular systems are permutation and rotation invariant as illustrated in the first diagram?

%

The first diagram illustrates that the energy of a molecule is both permutation and rotation invariant. This means that the energy value of a molecule does not change regardless of the order in which the atoms are arranged or its orientation in space. In the diagram, the energy is noted as \( E = 0.5 \text{ kcal mol}^{-1} \), which remains constant regardless of the permutation and rotation of the atoms.

How does the force on each atom behave under rotation, as indicated by the diagrams?

%

The force on each atom is rotation equivariant, which means that the direction of the force changes consistently with the rotation of the molecule. In the middle and right diagrams, it is shown that when the molecule is rotated, the force vectors (indicated by the arrow "F") also rotate accordingly, demonstrating the equivariant nature of forces under rotation.
