ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a diagram illustrating a biomedical knowledge graph showing the different types of interactions between entities such as proteins, drugs, viruses, and diseases. In this specific example, the diagram is focused on the relationships among:

- Proteins like "SARS-CoV-2 protease" and the "Spike protein"
- Viruses "SARS-CoV" and "SARS-CoV-2"
- Drugs such as "Molnupiravir" and "Remdesivir," including a combination drug "Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir"
- A symptom "COVID-19" and a disease manifestation "Pneumonia"

Different colored boxes represent different categories of entities: proteins are outlined in yellow, viruses in pink or red, drugs in green, and symptoms and diseases are in various shades of blue. The directed edges between boxes (arrows and lines) indicate the types of interactions or relationships, such as "binds to," "contains," "inhibits," "treats," "causes," etc.

This graph is used to encode complex relationships between biomedical entities and could be used in machine learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), to predict unknown relationships or the effects of interventions. The relationships depicted emphasize the relevance of these nodes and edges to the current COVID-19 pandemic, showing which drugs treat the disease or its symptoms, the virus that causes the disease, and a virus protein that is targeted by drugs.
