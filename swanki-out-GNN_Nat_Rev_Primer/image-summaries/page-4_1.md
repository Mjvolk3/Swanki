ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts a set of graphs used to illustrate the challenge of graph isomorphism, specifically addressing how a standard graph neural network (GNN) modeled after the Weisfeiler-Leman test might fail to distinguish between the provided graphs. The two graphs on the left, composed of a series of interconnected purple circles, are considered to be equal, even though one has an additional node attached to it. However, when they are translated into the blue circle representations on the right, one of the blue circle graphs has an additional gray node, suggesting a different structure. Despite this structural difference, the GNN will not distinguish between the bottom blue circle graph and the top one. The arrows with "Different" and "Equal" labels indicate the comparison results between graphs, explaining that the GNN perceives the top and bottom graphs on the right as being equal, even though they should be seen as different due to the presence of an extra node in one of them. This illustrates the limitations of some GNNs in graph isomorphism tasks.
