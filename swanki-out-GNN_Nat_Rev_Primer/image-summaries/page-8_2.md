ChatGPT figure/image summary: The first image displays a section of an academic paper's page titled "Primer," discussing applications of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the context of knowledge graphs, particularly in biomedical knowledge graphs. The image shows a graphical abstract or illustration related to Fig. 4a, which features a biomedical knowledge graph with different types of interactions between entities (nodes), including proteins, drugs, viruses, or diseases. While the content describes the various interactions represented as edges, the actual graphical content of the image is not visible here.

The second image is an extension of the first, continuing the same academic paper, further discussing applications of GNNs, specifically in the context of molecular property prediction. It corresponds to Fig. 4b of the paper, illustrating the use of GNNs for rapid quantum property prediction as compared to traditional quantum simulations. The visual abstract represents molecular structures and highlights the computational advantage of using GNNs in terms of speed, shifting from thousands of seconds for quantum simulations to a fraction of a second using GNNs. It features molecules and showcases their 3D structural features, such as atom-to-atom distances and angles, which are inputs to the GNN to predict quantum properties like potential energy (denoted as \( E \)) and vibrational mode frequency (denoted as \( \omega_0 \)).
