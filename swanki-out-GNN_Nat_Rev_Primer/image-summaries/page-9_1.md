ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a diagram illustrating the process of fragment-based molecular generation. This involves constructing a complex molecular structure by sequentially adding smaller molecular fragments or subgraphs.

1. A starting molecular structure is shown, with atoms represented by circles and bonds by lines connecting them.
2. A new fragment is chosen to be added to the structure. This fragment is highlighted in a darker shade.
3. & 4. Dotted lines and enclosed dashes represent the possible connection points where the new fragment could be attached to the existing structure.
5. Once a connection point is selected, the new fragment is integrated into the molecular structure, expanding it.
6. & 7. Further portions of the molecular structure are considered for additional extensions.
8. A different molecular fragment, depicted in vibrant colors, can be added to other parts of the base structure.

The entire process suggests an iterative approach to molecular design where, at each step, various subgraphs (fragments) are considered for addition to grow the molecule, potentially guided by a set of rules or constraints to ensure the resulting molecule has the desired properties. This visual representation aids in comprehending how molecules can be systematically constructed for applications in fields such as drug discovery.
