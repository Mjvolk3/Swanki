ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a clustered 2D embedding of molecules, where each point corresponds to a molecule, and similar ones are clustered together. There are distinguishable clusters, with a purple outline enclosing what's labeled as the training set and a blue outline enclosing the test data. Within these clusters, there are different colored points which may indicate various attributes or classifications such as true positives or false negatives. Large yellow points and grey points are indicated, which could correspond to true positive and false positive antibiotic activity predictions of a graph neural network, respectively. The image appears to have been used to illustrate the concept of data splitting and to evaluate the generalization capability of a model to a test distribution that deviates substantially from the training data.
