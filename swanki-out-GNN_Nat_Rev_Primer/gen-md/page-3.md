## Explain the equation used to update the representation $h_i^{(l)}$ of node $i$ at layer $\ell$ in the given text.
The equation provided in the text is:

$$
h_{i}^{(l+1)} = \operatorname{ReLU} \left( W^{(l+1)} \left( h_{i}^{(l)} + \sum_{j} h_{j}^{(l)} \right) \right)
$$

This equation represents how the representation of node $i$ at layer $\ell + 1$ is computed using a learnable linear transformation $W^{(l+1)}$, the non-linearity function ReLU, and the sum of the representations of node $i$ and its neighboring nodes at layer $\ell$.

## What is the computational complexity of a message-passing layer in GNNs as described in the text?

The computational complexity of a message-passing layer in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is given by:

$$
O(|E| + |V|) = O(|E|)
$$

where $E$ is the set of edges and $V$ is the set of nodes. This indicates that the complexity is linear in the number of edges, since in connected graphs $|E| \geq |V| - 1$.

## Describe two methods to parallelize message computation and aggregation in GNNs as discussed in the text.

1. **Matrix and Dot Products**:
   - Store edge information and messages as pairwise matrices.
   - Efficiently transform via matrix and dot products.
   - However, this method incurs a runtime and memory complexity of $O(|V|^2)$.

2. **Sparse Matrix Data Structures or Adjacency Lists**:
   - Represent the graph in a sparse matrix data structure or adjacency list.
   - Allows computations to be parallelized while maintaining $O(|E|)$ complexity.
   - Efficient for large sparse graphs.

## What are the advantages of using specialized libraries for GNNs as mentioned in the text?

Specialized libraries for GNNs, such as PyTorch Geometric, Deep Graph Library, Chemprop, and e3nn, offer several advantages:
- **Instantiations of Existing Models**: These libraries provide ready-to-use implementations of various GNN models.
- **Simplified Implementation**: They simplify the implementation of novel GNN architectures.
- **Access to Datasets and Auxiliary Tools**: They provide access to datasets and tools, such as featurization and preprocessing.

## Explain the difference between inductive and transductive settings for data-splitting in GNNs as described in the text.

- **Inductive Settings**: 
   - Involve separate objects for training, validation, and testing datasets.
   - Each set contains different graphs on which the GNNs are trained and evaluated.
   - Common in scenarios like molecular property prediction, where different sets of molecules are used for training and testing.

- **Transductive Settings**:
   - Not specifically detailed in the text but typically involve using the same graph for training and testing with different subsets of nodes or edges.

## What is the final prediction process described for molecular property prediction tasks using GNNs?

In molecular property prediction tasks, a single prediction is made for the entire graph. The process includes:
1. **Aggregation**: Representations of all nodes in the last layer are summed.
2. **Transformation**: The aggregated sum is passed through a linear layer with an output dimension of 1 to make the final prediction (likelihood of inhibition).
