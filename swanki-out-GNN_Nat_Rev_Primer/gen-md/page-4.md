## Explain the concept of locality bias as described in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

Locality bias refers to the tendency of GNNs to leverage the information from neighboring nodes to build better representations of a node. This concept is fundamental to the message-passing mechanism in GNNs.

- GNN
- message-passing
- locality-bias
%
By focusing on neighboring nodes, rather than a random set of nodes, the model learns more generalizable functions:

$$
h_v^{(k+1)} = \mathcal{U}\left(h_v^{(k)}, \{h_u^{(k)}: u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\}\right)
$$

where $h_v^{(k)}$ is the representation of node $v$ at layer $k$, $\mathcal{N}(v)$ represents the neighbors of $v$, and $\mathcal{U}$ is the update function. This bias helps improve the model's generalization capabilities.

## What is the primary purpose of using scaffold splits in training sets for molecular data?

Scaffold splits are used to ensure the model's capability to generalize to a test distribution that is substantially different from the training data. This is achieved by having molecules in the training and test sets with different core substructures.

- #chemoinformatics, #model-generalization 
%
The scaffold split approach splits molecules based on their structural frameworks (scaffolds). This means that:

$$
\text{Training set:} \quad \{\text{molecules with scaffold } S_1, S_2, \ldots \}
$$
$$
\text{Test set:} \quad \{\text{molecules with scaffold } S_3, S_4, \ldots \}
$$

By doing so, we aim to test the model's performance on new, unseen scaffolds, which is crucial for real-world applications where novel molecules are encountered.

## In the context of GNNs, what does a higher Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) signify?

A higher ROC-AUC indicates better model performance in distinguishing between classes.

- #GNN, #performance-metrics
%
ROC-AUC provides a comprehensive measure of a model's discriminative ability. An ROC-AUC of 1 indicates perfect classification, while 0.5 suggests no better than random guessing. In the paper, the GNN trained for HIV inhibition prediction achieved:

$$
\text{ROC-AUC (training)} = 82.5\%
$$
$$
\text{ROC-AUC (validation)} = 73.0\%
$$

This drop suggests overfitting, but fine-tuning the model (e.g., early stopping) helped achieve a stable performance.

## What is overfitting, and how does it affect a model's performance?

Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too complex and starts to memorize the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns. This typically leads to high training accuracy but poor performance on unseen data.

- #machine-learning, #overfitting, #model-performance
%
Overfitting is often reflected by a disparity between training and validation performance. For instance, in the paper:

- Training ROC-AUC: 82.5%
- Validation ROC-AUC: 73.0%

Overfitting can be mitigated via techniques like early stopping, where training is halted once validation performance peaks:

$$
\text{Early stopping ROC-AUC: } 77.9\%
$$

leading to improved test performance:

$$
\text{Test ROC-AUC: } 74.5\%
$$

as opposed to shallow FF-NNs (Feedforward Neural Networks) on Morgan fingerprints, which achieved lower test ROC-AUC.

## Why is cross-entropy used as the loss function in the classification task described?

Cross-entropy is used as the loss function because it measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1.

- #classification, #loss-function
%
In binary classification, the cross-entropy loss is calculated as:

$$
L(y, \hat{y}) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i) \right]
$$

where $y_i$ is the true label and $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted probability. This loss function penalizes confident yet incorrect predictions more heavily, helping the model to better optimize for accuracy.

## What are the two fundamental properties that improve the data efficiency and accuracy of GNNs compared to standard FF-NNs?

The two fundamental properties that contribute to the superior performance of GNNs are locality bias and permutation equivariance.

- #GNN, #model-properties, #data-efficiency
%
**Locality Bias**: GNNs leverage the spatial locality of graphs, using information from neighboring nodes to improve representations.

**Permutation Equivariance**: GNNs ensure that the node representations are invariant to the order in which nodes are presented. This aligns with the inherent symmetric properties of graph data.

The mathematical representation for message-passing in GNNs, which embodies locality bias, is:

$$
h_v^{(k+1)} = \mathcal{U}\left(h_v^{(k)}, \{h_u^{(k)}: u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\}\right)
$$

These properties enable GNNs to learn efficiently and accurately from graph-structured data.
