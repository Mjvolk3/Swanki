## Explain the term "Big O notation" as defined in the paper chunk.

Big O notation is used in complexity theory to describe how the worst-case runtime of an algorithm scales with the size of the input. It provides an upper bound on the running time, helping to understand the efficiency of an algorithm.

## Describe the connection between molecules and diseases in the "Composition pattern" section of the paper.

The composition pattern suggests that if molecule $A$ binds to protein $B$, and protein $B$ is involved in the mechanism of disease $\mathrm{C}$, then $\mathrm{A}$ is a potential candidate for treating $\mathrm{C}$. This pattern helps identify therapeutic targets.

## What is the fundamental component of graph neural networks mentioned in the paper chunk? Describe its function.

The fundamental component of graph neural networks is the message-passing layer. It iteratively aggregates and updates the features from neighboring nodes, enabling the propagation of information throughout the graph structure.

## Define the ReLU function and write its mathematical form as given in the paper chunk.

The rectified linear unit (ReLU) is a common non-linear activation function used in neural networks. Its simple form is:
$$\operatorname{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)$$

## What is oversmoothing in the context of GNNs, and what are some proposed solutions mentioned in the paper?

Oversmoothing is a limitation where individual node features become nearly identical as the number of GNN layers increases. Proposed solutions include JKNets, which introduce skip connections, and Graff, which biases the information flow to alleviate oversmoothing.

## {{c1::What does ROC-AUC measure in machine learning?}} {{c2::What does ROC-AUC stand for?}}

{{c1::ROC-AUC measures the precision of a binary classifier, especially informative in settings with unbalanced classes. This is useful for understanding the overall performance of different classifiers.}}

{{c2::ROC-AUC stands for the area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic.}}
