## Why is the interpretability of GNN models important for applications in the life sciences?

Interpretability of GNN models is crucial in the life sciences because it allows researchers to understand the model's reasoning, build surrogate, less expressive models, and be experimentally verifiable. For example, predicting whether a molecule is toxic by understanding which human proteins the ligand binds to and the side effects caused by these interactions is more interpretable and experimentally verifiable.

## Explain the potential application of GNNs in modeling dynamic graphs in the life sciences. Provide an example.

One potential application of GNNs in the life sciences is in modeling dynamic graphs. An example is using GNNs to model brain activity profiles as brain networks with signals for nodes that evolve over time. Another example is modeling disease spread as a dynamic graph for better predictions and large positive impacts.

## How can using domain knowledge and multi-modal integrations improve the interpretability of GNNs?

Using domain knowledge and multi-modal integrations can enhance the interpretability of GNNs by directly incorporating interpretability into the task that the model optimizes for. For example, rather than framing a task as a simple binary classification (e.g., predicting toxicity), the model can predict interaction patterns that are easier to interpret and validate experimentally.

## What is a temporal graph network, and why is it promising for applications in the life sciences?

A temporal graph network captures the evolution of graphs over time and has been well-researched for domains outside life sciences. Its application in life sciences is promising due to the dynamic nature of many biological phenomena, such as brain activity changes over time or disease spread. These can be better forecasted with temporal graph networks.

## How can GNNs impact the field of drug discovery?

GNNs can significantly impact drug discovery by learning detailed molecular representations and predicting interactions between molecules and target proteins. This approach helps in understanding drug mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic compounds more efficiently.
