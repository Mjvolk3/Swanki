## What is the message-passing function of a GCN?

The message-passing function of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) can be expressed as:

$$
h^{(l+1)}=\sigma\left(\widetilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}} \widetilde{A} \widetilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}} h^{(l)} W+b\right)
$$

Where $\widetilde{A}$ is the adjacency matrix with added self-loops, $\widetilde{D}$ is a diagonal matrix with node degrees, $h^{(l)}$ is the node representation at layer $l$, $W$ is the weight matrix, $b$ is the bias, and $\sigma$ is an activation function.

## What is the message-passing function of a GAT?

The message-passing function of a Graph Attention Network (GAT) is represented as:

$$
h_{i}^{(l+1)}=\sigma\left(\sum_{j \in N_{i}} a\left(h_{i}^{(l)}, h_{j}^{(l)}\right) W h_{j}^{(l)}\right)
$$

Here, $h_{i}^{(l)}$ is the representation of node $i$ at layer $l$, $N_{i}$ denotes the neighbors of node $i$, $a$ is an attention mechanism, $W$ is a weight matrix, and $\sigma$ is an activation function.

## What role does the attention mechanism play in GAT?

The attention mechanism in Graph Attention Networks (GAT) determines the importance of each neighboring node's representation. It is mathematically represented by a learned function $a$ that computes attention coefficients:

$$
a\left(h_{i}^{(l)}, h_{j}^{(l)}\right)
$$

This allows the network to weigh the contributions from different neighbors, enabling it to focus on the most relevant information.

## What is the generalized message-passing layer equation in GNN architectures?

The general message-passing layer in GNN architectures can be written as:

$$
h_{i}^{(l+1)}=\rho\left(h_{i}^{(l)}, \bigoplus_{j \in N_{i}} \mu\left(h_{i}^{(l)}, h_{j}^{(l)}, e_{i j}\right)\right)
$$

Where $\rho$ and $\mu$ are learnable feedforward transformation functions, $\oplus$ is a predetermined aggregation function, $h_{i}^{(l)}$ is the representation of node $i$ at layer $l$, $N_{i}$ are neighbors of node $i$, and $e_{ij}$ denotes edge features between nodes $i$ and $j$.

## How does graph rewiring help with long-range interactions in GNNs?

Graph rewiring addresses the challenge of reasoning over long-range interactions by modifying the original graph structure to preserve meaningful connections and alleviate bottlenecks. This can help in applications where capturing long-distance patterns is crucial, as it allows the GNN to better model these patterns.

## How are geometric graphs typically modeled in GNNs?

In geometric graphs, nodes are embedded in 3D space, and their coordinates are treated as features that are analyzed in relation to one another. These graphs are modeled using specific types of GNNs that take into account the spatial relationships between nodes.
