# Swanki Refactor Progress Report

## Original Plan (from refactor.md)

The refactor aimed to modernize the PDF-to-Anki card generation system with:
- **Hydra Configuration**: Flexible, user-customizable pipeline
- **Structured Output**: Migration to `instructor` library with Pydantic models
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Summary-first approach
- **User Control**: Multiple configurable outputs

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Infrastructure Setup
- Created new directory structure: `config/`, `models/`, `pipeline/`, `utils/`, `legacy/`
- Implemented ConfigGenerator that auto-creates Hydra configs in `.swanki_config/`
- Set up Pydantic models for structured output (cards, documents, audio, pipeline state)
- Integrated `python-dotenv` for SWANKI_DATA environment variable

### 2. ✅ Hydra Integration
- Successfully integrated Hydra for configuration management
- Config files are generated locally (in current directory) rather than home directory
- Fixed command syntax to use Hydra format: `pdf_path=X citation_key=Y` (no -- prefix)
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy mode (`--legacy` flag)

### 3. ✅ Pipeline Structure
- Created main Pipeline class that orchestrates the entire process
- Successfully integrated with legacy functions (maintaining existing functionality)
- Output directory structure working correctly: `$SWANKI_DATA/citation_key/`
- Added auto-increment for duplicate citation keys (appends _0, _1, etc.)

### 4. ✅ Current Pipeline Progress
The pipeline is successfully executing through:
1. **PDF Split** ✅ - Creating individual page PDFs
2. **Markdown Conversion** ✅ - Using Mathpix (mpx) to convert PDFs to markdown
3. **Markdown Cleaning** ✅ - Cleaning up the markdown files

## Current Issue

The pipeline fails at the **Image Processing** stage with:
```
KeyError: 'summary'
```

This occurs because the config structure has nested keys, but we're accessing them incorrectly. The config has `prompts.summary.image_summary` but the code expects a different structure.

## Pipeline Status

```
✅ PDF Split (page-1.pdf, page-2.pdf created)
✅ Markdown Conversion (page-1.md, page-2.md created)
✅ Markdown Cleaning (clean-md-singles created)
❌ Image Processing (KeyError on config access)
⏸️ Document Summary Generation
⏸️ Card Generation with Sliding Window
⏸️ Audio Generation
⏸️ Output File Generation
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Config Access**: Update the pipeline to properly access nested config values
2. **Complete Image Processing**: Implement the image summary extraction
3. **Implement Document Summary**: Use instructor to generate structured summaries
4. **Card Generation**: Implement sliding window approach with context
5. **Audio Pipeline**: Integrate audio generation (complementary, summary, reading)

## Key Learnings

1. **Legacy Integration**: Successfully wrapped legacy functions but needed to adapt their directory-based approach
2. **Hydra Quirks**: 
   - Can't use `--` prefix for arguments
   - Config path must be absolute for Hydra to find it
   - Defaults need proper YAML structure (dict format, not strings)
3. **Directory Structure**: All outputs properly organized under `$SWANKI_DATA/citation_key/`

## Technical Debt to Address

1. Many legacy functions return `None` and work via side effects (file creation)
2. Need to properly parse image summaries from the processed files
3. Audio generation integration still pending
4. Need to implement proper error handling and logging

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Hydra configuration working
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Proper directory structure
- ✅ Auto-increment for duplicate runs
- ⏸️ Structured output with Pydantic
- ⏸️ Context-aware card generation
- ⏸️ Multiple output formats

## Conclusion

We've successfully laid the foundation with Hydra configuration and pipeline structure. The system is processing PDFs through markdown conversion and cleaning. The next critical step is fixing the config access issue and completing the remaining pipeline stages to achieve the full refactor vision.
