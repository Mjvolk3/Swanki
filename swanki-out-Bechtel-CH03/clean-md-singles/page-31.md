which continually regenerate themselves and grow through polymerization" (Pflüger, 1875, p. 343, as quoted in Fruton, 1972, p. 284).

As Pflüger's proposal exemplifies, theorizing about metabolic mechanisms in the later part of the nineteenth century was highly speculative. In large part, this was because proteins are extremely complex and it was not possible at the time to establish that they were even molecular in character. Whereas organic chemists focused on relatively simple molecules in order to make progress in articulating the structure of organic compounds, researchers interested in the chemistry underlying physiological functions emphasized the likely importance of complex organization. One avenue toward complexity was offered by colloid chemistry, which emphasized molecules organized in arrays on surfaces. It became increasingly influential after Thomas Graham (1861) proposed that protoplasm was composed of colloidal arrays rather than less structured molecules. Investigators such as Wolfgang Ostwald (1909) emphasized the multiple phases of colloidal dispersion and the energies associated with surfaces. Some historians of biochemistry, such as Marcel Florkin (1972, pp. 279-83), have bemoaned this as the "dark age of biocolloidology." Florkin portrayed the influence of colloid chemistry on physiology as hindering the advance of a theoretically sound biochemistry and so drew a sharp contrast between colloidal chemistry and biochemistry. Yet, even as major a contributor to biochemistry as Otto Warburg began his career emphasizing the importance of colloidal surfaces for cell respiration (Warburg, 1911; Warburg, $1913 b){ }^{29}$

\section*{The Emergence of Biochemistry in the Twentieth Century}

The pioneering efforts to provide chemical explanations of vital processes in the nineteenth century suddenly developed into a robust research endeavor in the early twentieth century. At this time, the term biochemistry began to supplant older labels such as physiological chemistry. In the first decade of the twentieth century, new journals developed with biochemistry in their titles ${ }^{30}$ and new professional societies were established. ${ }^{31}$ In 1909 Carl Oppenheimer
