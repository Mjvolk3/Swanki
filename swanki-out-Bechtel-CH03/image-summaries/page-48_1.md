ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a schematic diagram illustrating the biochemical process of cellular respiration. It displays a simplified reaction pathway integrating the theories of Wieland and Warburg regarding the oxidation process in cells. Here, dehydrogenase enzymes activate hydrogen to enable its separation from the substrate (as suggested by Wieland), while Atmungsferment (a term associated with Warburg) activates oxygen to allow it to combine with hydrogen. The outcome of this interaction is the formation of water (H2O), with two hydrogen atoms (2H) reacting with half a molecule of oxygen (1/2 O2) to produce water. This diagram is referred to as Figure 3.13 in the text and is described as providing a schematic account of how Wieland's account of respiration in terms of dehydrogenation could be linked to Warburg's proposal of an enzyme acting on molecular oxygen.
