ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image is a diagram representing the process of glycolysis as conceptualized by the scientist Embden. It shows a metabolic pathway where fructose diphosphate (C6H10O4(PO4H2)2) is split into two three-carbon molecules: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (C3H5O2(PO4H2)) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (C3H5O2(PO4H2)). From there, dihydroxyacetone phosphate can be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and both molecules can enter a series of reactions that result in the formation of glycerophosphoric acid (C3H7O2(PO4H2)), phosphoglyceric acid (C3H5O3(PO4H2)), and ultimately pyruvic acid (C3H4O3). Pyruvic acid can then be further reduced to lactic acid (C3H6O3) or can release a phosphate group to form inorganic phosphate (H3PO4). The diagram highlights the role of phosphorylated intermediates and the transfer of high-energy phosphate groups during the glycolysis process in muscle cells.
