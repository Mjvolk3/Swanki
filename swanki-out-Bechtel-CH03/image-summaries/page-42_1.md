ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided is a simplified diagram illustrating three alternative metabolic pathways that pyruvic acid can follow. The diagram is showing how 2 molecules of pyruvic acid can be converted into:

1. 2 molecules of lactic acid, a process that occurs in anaerobic environments (such as during intense exercise when oxygen supply is limited) and results in the regeneration of 2 NAD⁺ molecules from 2 NADH + 2 H⁺.
  
2. 2 molecules of ethanol and 2 molecules of carbon dioxide (CO₂), also occurring in anaerobic conditions, commonly observed during alcoholic fermentation where yeast converts pyruvic acid into ethanol. This process also regenerates 2 NAD⁺ molecules from 2 NADH + 2 H⁺.

3. Acetyl-CoA (acetyl coenzyme A), which requires a decarboxylation step where one molecule of CO₂ is released per pyruvic acid molecule, ultimately resulting in entry into the aerobic citric acid cycle. This process also involves the generation of NADH from NAD⁺.

The diagram emphasizes the divergence of metabolic pathways post glycolysis depending on the presence or absence of oxygen. The conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl-CoA is a link to aerobic respiration where the acetyl-CoA then enters the citric acid cycle. In contrast, the conversion to lactic acid or ethanol represents branches of anaerobic fermentation pathways.
