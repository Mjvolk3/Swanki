ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image depicts a pathway of fermentation as proposed by Neuberg and Kerb. It shows glucose (C6H12O6) undergoing a reaction to form two molecules of methylglyoxal (C3H4O2) and water (H2O). Methylglyoxal then reacts to produce two molecules of pyruvic acid (C3H4O3) and two molecules of alcohol (C2H5OH). Each pyruvic acid is then decarboxylated to yield two molecules of acetaldehyde (C2H4O), and the process feeds back into the cycle, where acetaldehyde can react again with methylglyoxal. Additionally, there is the generation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the decarboxylation step. This representation highlights how the process constitutes a cycle, as explained in figure 3.6 of the given paper.
