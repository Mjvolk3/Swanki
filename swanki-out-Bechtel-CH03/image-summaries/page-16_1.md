ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a schematic representation of the Danielli-Davson model of a biological membrane structure. This model illustrates a lipid bilayer with proteins lining each surface. The specific features highlighted in the diagram include:

- **Proteins:** These are represented at the top and bottom as jagged lines, indicating the presence of protein layers on the outer surfaces of the lipid bilayer.
- **Hydrophilic Regions:** The circular heads with a zigzag pattern, located just beneath the protein layers, represent the hydrophilic (water-attracting) parts of the phospholipid molecules.
- **Hydrophobic Regions:** The straight lines extending downward from the hydrophilic heads illustrate the hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails of the phospholipid molecules.

In the Danielli-Davson model, proteins are not embedded within the membrane but rather coat the exterior surfaces, which was a key conceptual aspect of this historical model of cell membrane structure. The alternating layers of hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails are consistent with the lipid bilayer concept where the heads face the aqueous environments inside and outside the cell, while the tails face each other, creating a region repellant to water within the membrane.
