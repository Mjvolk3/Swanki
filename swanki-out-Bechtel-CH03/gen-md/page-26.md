## What significant contributions did Antoine Lavoisier make to the foundation of biochemistry?

Antoine Lavoisier significantly contributed to charting the path for future biochemistry by determining that carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are constituents of all living organic substances. His work laid the groundwork for analyzing organic substances in terms of these elements.

## Describe the role of biochemistry in moving beyond the limited resources of cytologists in the early twentieth century.

During the first half of the twentieth century, biochemistry emerged as a crucial field for understanding cell mechanisms, enabling researchers to move beyond the limitations of purely cytological methods by providing a deeper insight into the chemical processes within cells.
