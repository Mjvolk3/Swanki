## What is the process called that involves the removal of two carbon atoms at a time during fat metabolism?

This process is known as $\beta$-oxidation. 

$\beta$-oxidation is essential in the metabolic pathway where fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria and/or peroxisomes to generate acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle, and NADH and FADH$_2$, which are used in the electron transport chain.

## By 1940, biochemists had developed detailed accounts of which two metabolic processes?

By 1940, biochemists had developed detailed accounts of:

1. The biochemical mechanisms involved in fermentation (glycolysis).
2. Aerobic cellular respiration.

These detailed accounts helped understand the pathways involved in these processes, although the full linkage, especially regarding ATP generation in aerobic respiration, required further investigation involving cell structure.

## What major difference exists between fermentation and aerobic respiration in terms of cellular organization?

Fermentation, particularly glycolysis, occurs freely in the cytoplasm and does not depend on cellular organization, whereas aerobic respiration involves complex processes linked with cell structure and membranes. This dependence on cell structure made it difficult to investigate with the tools available by 1940.

This difference highlights why research in fermentation advanced more rapidly than in aerobic respiration where structural components play a critical role in processes such as ATP generation.

## Who first demonstrated cell-free fermentation and how was it proven?

Eduard Buchner first demonstrated cell-free fermentation in 1897. He added sugar to press juice made by adding water to ground yeast and filtering it under pressure. The resulting formation of carbon dioxide indicated fermentation was occurring without living yeast cells, demonstrating that the components inside the cells, termed zymase, were responsible for the fermentation process.

Buchnerâ€™s discovery showed that enzymes within the extract could carry out fermentation, overturning the orthodox view that living yeast cells were needed for fermentation.
