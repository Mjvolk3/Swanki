## Emphasis on Colloidal Chemistry in Early Biochemistry

Colloid chemistry was influential in early physiological studies due to its focus on molecular organization on surfaces, highlighted by Thomas Graham in 1861. 

\section*{The Emergence of Biochemistry in the Twentieth Century}

%
Why did investigators like Thomas Graham propose that protoplasm was composed of colloidal arrays?

%
Thomas Graham proposed that protoplasm was composed of colloidal arrays because colloid chemistry focuses on molecules organized in arrays on surfaces, which was aligned with the complex organization required to explain physiological functions. This influenced researchers at the time to emphasize surface energies and complex molecular phases in their studies.

## Transformation into Biochemistry

During the early twentieth century, biochemical research began to establish its own identity separate from physiological chemistry.

%
What significant changes occurred in the early twentieth century that marked the development of biochemistry as a distinct field?

%
Several significant changes marked the development of biochemistry as a distinct field in the early twentieth century:
1. The term "biochemistry" began to supplant "physiological chemistry."
2. New journals with biochemistry in their titles emerged, such as *Journal of Biological Chemistry* (1905).
3. New professional societies were established, including the section of biological chemistry in the American Chemical Society (1905) and the Biochemical Club in England (1911).

## Otto Warburg and Enzymology

Otto Warburg played a significant role in early biochemistry focusing on colloidal surfaces and later on enzymes, although he referred to enzymes using the older term "ferment."

%
What substance did Otto Warburg identify and what was its significance for cell respiration?

%
Otto Warburg identified a substance he called Atmungsferment, now known as cytochrome oxidase. This enzyme is crucial for cell respiration, as it facilitates the final step in the electron transport chain, enabling ATP synthesis by transferring electrons to oxygen.

## Biochemistry Journals and Societies

The establishment of journals and societies played a crucial role in the dissemination and development of biochemistry as a scientific discipline.

%
List at least three biochemical journals that were established in the early twentieth century.

%
Three biochemical journals established in the early twentieth century are:
1. *Biochemisches Centralblatt* (1902)
2. *Journal of Biological Chemistry* (1905)
3. *Biochemische Zeitschrift* (1906)

These publications contributed significantly to biochemistry by providing dedicated platforms for new research and discoveries.
