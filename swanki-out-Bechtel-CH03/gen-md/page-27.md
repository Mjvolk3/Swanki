## What is the chemical equation for fermentation as worked out by Thénard and Gay-Lussac in the 19th century?

The chemical equation for fermentation, as formulated by Louis Jacques Thénard and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, is represented as:

$$
\mathrm{C}_{6}\mathrm{H}_{12}\mathrm{O}_{6} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}_{2} + 2 \mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{5}\mathrm{OH}
$$

## What did Lavoisier and LaPlace conclude about respiration in their research?

Lavoisier and LaPlace concluded that "Respiration is thus a very slow combustion phenomenon, very similar to that of coal." This implies that respiration is fundamentally a combustion process where oxygen is used to convert organic compounds into carbon dioxide and heat. 

Essentially, they compared the heat generated by respiration in animals to the heat of combustion of coal generating the same amount of carbon dioxide.

## Who introduced the term "catalysis" and what was its initial application in biochemistry?

Jöns Jacob Berzelius introduced the term "catalysis" in 1836. He proposed applying the idea to fermentation, citing substances known as catalysts that facilitated chemical reactions without being consumed by them.

Berzelius also pointed out the similarity between chemical reactions occurring in inorganic nature and those in living organisms, particularly focusing on substances that could promote reactions like fermentation.

## What was the significance of Payen and Persoz's extraction of the chemical component diastase from germinating grains of malt?

Payen and Persoz's extraction of diastase from germinating grains of malt in 1833 was significant because it isolated the chemical component that facilitated the conversion of starch to sugar. This discovery confirmed that chemical reactions promoted by specific substances, later known as enzymes, were crucial to biological processes such as fermentation.

This discovery was foundational because it demonstrated specific biochemical catalysts that promoted reactions without being consumed, hence showing functional parallels with inorganic catalysts.
