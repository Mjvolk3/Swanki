## Why did Neuberg propose that the intermediate in the pathway of fermentation was an isomer of methylglyoxal, rather than methylglyoxal itself?

Because methylglyoxal failed the critical test of reacting to form alcohol at least as rapidly as glucose, Neuberg proposed that it was an isomer of methylglyoxal that was the true intermediate.

## What important discovery did Arthur Harden make in 1903 regarding fermentation in cell-free extracts?

Arthur Harden established that adding blood serum would produce an $80 \%$ increase in fermentation.

## How did phosphate affect fermentation in the experiments conducted by Harden and Young?

Adding phosphate stimulated the fermentation reaction, which would then slow down again when the phosphate was exhausted. They also established that phosphate appeared to be taken up into a hexosediphosphate ester.

$$
\text{Phosphate} + \text{Fermentation} \rightarrow \text{Hexosediphosphate Ester (Hexose-2PO}_4\text{)} \text{+ Hydrolysis Decomposition}
$$

## What additional requirement did Harden and Young identify for maintaining fermentation in cell-free extracts?

Harden and Young demonstrated the need for the addition of a "dialyzable substance which is not destroyed by heat" to maintain cell-free fermentation, indicating the presence of another essential substance aside from the heat-sensitive enzyme.
