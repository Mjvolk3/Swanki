## Describe the transformation from pyruvic acid to citric acid in the Krebs cycle. Mention the intermediates and key enzymes involved.

The transformation from pyruvic acid (pyruvate) to citric acid in the Krebs cycle involves several steps:
1. Pyruvate combines with oxaloacetic acid to form citric acid.
2. This process involves the intermediate acetyl-CoA, an activated form of acetic acid.
3. Key enzymes include pyruvate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase.

$$
\text{Pyruvate} + \text{CoA-SH} + \text{NAD}^+ \xrightarrow{\text{pyruvate dehydrogenase}} \text{Acetyl-CoA} + \text{CO}_2 + \text{NADH}
$$

In the presence of citrate synthase:
$$
\text{Acetyl-CoA} + \text{Oxaloacetate} \rightarrow \text{Citrate}
$$

## Explain why ordinary acetic acid cannot condense with oxaloacetic acid to create citric acid. What is the form of acetic acid required for this reaction?

Ordinary acetic acid cannot condense with oxaloacetic acid to create citric acid because it lacks the necessary activation. The acetic acid must first be converted to an activated form, specifically a thioester of acetylated coenzyme A, known as acetyl-CoA.

$$
\text{Acetyl-CoA} = \text{CH}_3\text{COS-CoA}
$$

This activated form, acetyl-CoA, can readily participate in the reaction catalyzed by citrate synthase in the Krebs cycle.

## Describe the role of Fritz Lippmann in the research connecting glycolysis to the citric acid cycle. What was his key discovery?

Fritz Lippmann played a pivotal role in connecting glycolysis to the citric acid cycle through his discovery of coenzyme A. His work demonstrated that coenzyme A is critical in the formation of activated acetic acid (acetyl-CoA), which then reacts with oxaloacetic acid to form citric acid.

This discovery bridged a vital gap between glycolysis, which produces pyruvate (converted to acetyl-CoA), and the Krebs cycle.

$$
\text{CoA-SH} + \text{Pyruvate} \rightarrow \text{Acetyl-CoA} + \text{CO}_2 + \text{NADH}
$$

## What key finding was David Keilin's significant contribution to understanding cellular respiration? How did he arrive at this discovery?

David Keilin's significant contribution to the understanding of cellular respiration was the discovery of respiratory pigments in the horse bot-fly (Gasterophilus intestinalis). Keilin detected a pigment with four distinct absorption bands, initially thought to be derived from larval hemoglobin.

Upon further spectroscopic examination of flies that died in captivity, he realized that this pigment was involved in the electron transport chain, a crucial component of cellular respiration.
