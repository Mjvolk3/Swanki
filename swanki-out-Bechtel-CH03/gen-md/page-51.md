## How many cytochromes did David Keilin identify in his research, and what were they labeled as?

David Keilin identified three different hemochromogens that he labeled cytochrome $a$, $b$, and $c$.

## Define the term cytochrome oxidase as used by Keilin and Hartree.

Cytochrome oxidase is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of cytochrome $a_{3}$ to water using molecular oxygen.

## Explain the significance of Warburg's Atmungsferment in relation to the electron transport chain.

Warburg's Atmungsferment was identified with cytochrome $a_{3}$ and is part of the electron transport chain, which involves the transfer of pairs of electrons down an energy gradient to molecular oxygen.

## What are the roles of NAD and NADP in the oxidative chain, according to Warburg's discoveries in the mid-1930s?

NAD (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) are coenzymes that connect oxidative reactions in the citric acid cycle to the electron transport chain.
