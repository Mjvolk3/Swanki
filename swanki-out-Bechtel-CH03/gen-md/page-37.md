## Explain Harden and Young's conceptualization of how phosphates might figure in fermentation involving glucose.

Harden and Young proposed that two molecules of glucose react with two phosphate molecules to create one hexosediphosphate ester and two molecules of alcohol. The hexosediphosphate slowly breaks back down to glucose and two phosphates, which can then participate in further reactions with another molecule of glucose.

## What was the significance of Gustav Embden's investigations into lactic acid fermentation, particularly involving hexosediphosphate?

Gustav Embden found that adding hexosediphosphate resulted in a large increase in lactic acid, suggesting its relation to an unknown precursor he designated lactacidogen. This work indicated a close connection between lactic acid fermentation and alcoholic fermentation.

## What term did Otto Meyerhof coin to describe the reaction pathways in both alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid fermentation?

Otto Meyerhof coined the term glycolysis to describe the reaction pathways in both alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid fermentation, reinforcing the close connection between the two processes.

## Describe the discovery and significance of phosphocreatine by Philip Eggleton and Marion Grace Palmer Eggleton.

Philip Eggleton and Marion Grace Palmer Eggleton isolated a substance known initially as phosphagen, later named phosphocreatine. Phosphocreatine rapidly hydrolyzes to creatine and phosphate, releasing large quantities of energy, which suggested it could provide the immediate source of energy for muscle contraction.
