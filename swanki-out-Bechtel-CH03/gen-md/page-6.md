## What was the primary similarity that Schwann noted between plant cells and animal tissues?

Schwann noted that the primary similarity between plant cells and animal tissues was the presence of the nucleus. This observation was significant because Schleiden had shown the importance of the nucleus in plant cells. Schwann identified opaque spots in the units of different animal tissues, especially those in an embryological state, and recognized them as nuclei. This led him to conclude that all animal tissues were comprised of cells, despite their varied appearances.

## Describe Schleiden’s and Schwann’s different accounts of cell formation. 

Schleiden proposed that cells formed within preexisting cells through a process of accretion. The material comprising the nucleus forms first around the nucleolus, and then another layer forms, corresponding to the cytoplasm, around the nucleus.

Schwann, however, adapted this mechanism for animal cells but located the process in the intercellular fluids rather than within existing cells. Schwann referred to this process in animals as exogenous cell formation and in plants as endogenous cell formation.

## Why might Schwann have been convinced that cells formed through exogenous processes rather than cell division?

Despite other investigators describing cell division and Schwann being a master of microscopic technique, Schwann was convinced that cells formed through exogenous processes because he sought to provide a mechanistic account of basic structures in living organisms. Schwann's objective was to establish a universal principle of development for all tissues. This mechanistic vision was influenced by Johannes Müller’s group of investigators, who pursued similar objectives.

## Explain Schwann’s universal principle of development for the elementary parts of organisms.

Schwann's universal principle of development stated that "The elementary parts of all tissues are formed of cells in an analogous, though very diversified manner." He believed there was one universal principle of development for the elementary parts of organisms, despite their diversity. This principle was the formation of cells, providing a foundational doctrine for cell theory: all living tissues are comprised of cells formed in a consistent manner across different organisms.
