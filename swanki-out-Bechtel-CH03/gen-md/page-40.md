## What contributions did Dorothy Needham make to the understanding of glycolysis and fermentation processes?

Dorothy Needham proposed a second esterification of phosphate in fermentation. She noted that when fluoride poisons blocked the step from phosphoglyceric acid to phosphopyruvic acid, free phosphate still continued to be taken up into an ester. She also observed that more phosphocreatine was formed per molecule of lactic acid than could be explained by the single transfer of phosphate from phosphopyruvic acid to ATP.

## What key findings did Warburg and Christian make in relation to the pathway involving ATP?

In 1934, Warburg and Christian found another constituent beyond ATP in a coferment preparation made from red blood cells. They identified it chemically as containing nicotinic acid amide. They characterized it functionally as a "hydrogentransporting co-ferment" and proposed the name triphosphopyridine nucleotide (TPN).

## What was the significant substance found by Warburg and Christian, and what are its different names?

Warburg and Christian discovered diphosphopyridine nucleotide (DPN), also known as coenzyme I, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and, in its oxidized/reduced states, $NAD^{+} / NADH$.

$$
\text{NAD} = \text{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}
$$
$$
\text{NAD}^+ = \text{oxidized state}
$$
$$
\text{NADH} = \text{reduced state}
$$

## How did Fritz Lipmann contribute to the understanding of energy and phosphate bonds in ATP?

Fritz Lipmann introduced the symbol $\sim \mathrm{P}$ to designate what he called "energy-rich phosphate bonds" in ATP.

$$
\text{ATP} = \text{Adenosine Triphosphate}
$$
$$
\sim \mathrm{P} = \text{energy-rich phosphate bonds}
$$
