## What significant discovery about membranes did Ernest Overton make in 1899?

Ernest Overton discovered that the cell membrane, largely composed of fats and lipids, operates as a semipermeable osmotic barrier between a cell and its environment. This indicates that it controls the passage of certain substances in and out of the cell.

## What effect did alkaline solutions have on sea urchin eggs' respiration according to Warburg (1910)?

Alkaline solutions increased the respiration of sea urchins without altering the alkalinity of the protoplasm. This finding was significant because it pointed to the cell membrane, not the protoplasm, as the site of cellular respiration.

## Describe Warburgâ€™s conclusion regarding the nature of Atmungsferment and its role in biological respiration.

Warburg concluded that Atmungsferment consisted of ferrous iron adsorbed onto the cell membranes. He proposed that this agent was responsible for biological respiration by activating oxygen so that it would combine with hydrogen in the substrate undergoing oxidation. 

$$
\text{Atmungsferment} \approx \text{Fe}^{2+} \text{ adsorbed on cell membranes}
$$

## How did Warburg challenge the contemporary view that only soluble enzymes were responsible for significant biological processes?

Warburg opposed the view that soluble enzymes alone were responsible for significant biological processes, asserting instead that these enzymes operated within the context of structured systems. He argued that both cell structure and enzymes were required for the acceleration of energy-producing reactions.

$$
\text{Energy-producing reactions} = \text{Ferment action} + \text{Structure action}
$$
