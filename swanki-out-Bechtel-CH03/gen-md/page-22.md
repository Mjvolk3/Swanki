## Who devised a method to put the organelle in sharp contrast with other cellular components and demonstrate it as a consistent structural component in various tissue cell types?

Camillo Golgi devised a method to put the organelle in sharp contrast with other cellular components and demonstrate it as a consistent structural component in various tissue cell types. His method is known for highlighting the structure and variability of the organelle.

## What term did Emil Holmgren coin for the clear canals within cytoplasm that remained uncolored when the rest of the cytoplasm was stained, and what did he claim they were?

Emil Holmgren coined the term "trophospongium" for the clear canals within the cytoplasm that remained uncolored when the rest of the cytoplasm was stained. He claimed they were the same as Golgi's reticular nets and suggested they might serve a nutritive function.

## What was Santiago Ramón y Cajal's initial assessment of Golgi's reticular structure and Holmgren's canals, and how did his view change later?

Initially, Santiago Ramón y Cajal accepted the link between Golgi's reticular structure and Holmgren's canals, referring to them as the Golgi-Holmgren canals. However, he later revised this assessment in 1914, suggesting a different understanding of the structures.

## How did Golgi's method contribute to the understanding of the Golgi apparatus, and what was one of its significant findings about the organelle?

Golgi's method allowed the organelle to stand out in sharp contrast with other cellular components, facilitating its study. One significant finding was that the Golgi apparatus is variable in character and position across different tissue cell types, highlighting its dynamic nature within the cell.
