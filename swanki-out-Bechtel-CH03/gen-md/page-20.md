## What was Edmund Cowdry's stance on the mitochondrial hypothesis in the early 20th century?

Edmund Cowdry was skeptical about the hypothesis that mitochondria take part in protoplasmic respiration. He considered it to be only a theory and maintained that much more needed to be known about their chemical constitution for any accurate interpretation.

## According to the paper, what role did Claudius Regaud propose for mitochondria in 1909?

Claudius Regaud's interpretation, as preferred by Cowdry, suggested that mitochondria serve to select substances out of the cytoplasm and transform them into different products.

## Why did Cowdry believe that the study of mitochondria would not achieve rapid progress?

Cowdry believed that the study of mitochondria would not achieve rapid progress until their chemical constitution was better understood. He emphasized the importance of direct, qualitative cellular chemistry for interpreting findings accurately.

## What was ergastoplasm, according to Charles Garnier's research, and how was it identified?

Ergastoplasm, according to Charles Garnier's research, was identified as a fibrillar material or rod-like structure in gland cells. Garnier used various stains like safranin, gentian violet, and toluidine blue to explore its presence and linked its intensity to the stage of secretion in gland cells.
