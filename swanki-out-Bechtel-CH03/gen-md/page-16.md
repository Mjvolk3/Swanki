## Explain the Danielli-Davson "sandwich" model of membrane structure including the role of proteins as shown in Figure 3.4.

The Danielli-Davson "sandwich" model of membrane structure posits that membranes are composed of a lipid bilayer with phospholipids arranged such that their hydrophobic tails face inward and their hydrophilic heads face outward. In addition to this bilayer, Danielli and Davson proposed that there are protein layers on the outer surfaces (represented by jagged lines in Figure 3.4), which help to stabilize the membrane and possibly play a role in its permeability.

## What critical observation did Overton make about membrane composition?

Overton observed that substances soluble in fats could pass through membranes more easily than water-soluble ones. This led him to infer that membranes are partly composed of lipids. Overton's conclusion was crucial in establishing lipids as a universal feature of cell membranes.

## What conclusion did Gorter and Grendel reach based on their lipid extraction from red blood cells, and how does it relate to membrane structure?

Gorter and Grendel concluded that there was just enough lipid in red blood cells to cover the cell with a layer two molecules thick. They proposed that each phospholipid molecule has a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail, and that these molecules form a bilayer with hydrophobic tails facing inward and hydrophilic heads facing outward. This arrangement makes the outside of the membrane hydrophilic and the inside hydrophobic.

## How did the findings of Danielli and Davson build on the work of Gorter and Grendel, and what did they add to the model of membrane structure?

Danielli and Davson built on Gorter and Grendel's work by adding that the lipid bilayer is flanked by protein layers. This "sandwich" model suggested that proteins cover the lipid bilayer, adding structural stability and possibly influencing membrane permeability. This model was critical in advancing the understanding of membrane structure and function.
