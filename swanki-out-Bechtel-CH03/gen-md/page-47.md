## Describe the debate between Wieland and Warburg regarding the mechanism of cellular respiration.

The debate between Wieland and Warburg centered on the mechanism of cellular respiration. Wieland proposed that dehydrogenases remove hydrogen atoms from substrates, playing a crucial role in oxidation. In contrast, Warburg focused on the activation of oxygen and the role of Atmungsferment in this process. Although both theories initially appeared conflicting, some researchers, like Albert Szent-Györgyi, suggested that both processes might be involved, proposing that activated hydrogen and oxygen work together in cellular oxidation.

## What did Albert Szent-Györgyi propose about cellular oxidation, and how did it relate to the theories of Wieland and Warburg?

Albert Szent-Györgyi proposed that in cellular oxidation, activated hydrogen is burned by the activated oxygen. He suggested that molecular oxygen is not a hydrogen acceptor; instead, the biological hydrogen acceptor is the oxygen activated in Warburg's system. This proposal indicated that the theories of Wieland and Warburg were not mutually exclusive but represented different parts of the same pathway.

## Explain the idea of "complex localization" as characterized by Bechtel and Richardson in the context of cellular respiration research in the 1920s and 1930s.

Bechtel and Richardson characterized the research shift in cellular respiration during the 1920s and 1930s as a move from "simple localization" to "complex localization." Researchers identified a series of interconnected operations forming a complex mechanism rather than a single, simple pathway. This involved uncovering numerous steps and reactions that link together in a sequence, such as Thunberg's proposal of dehydrogenation chains.

## Describe Thunberg's contribution to the understanding of cellular respiration and his proposal of a sequence of dehydrogenation reactions.

Thunberg proposed the concept of a sequence of dehydrogenation reactions in cellular respiration, where the product of one dehydrogenation reaction is further dehydrogenated or otherwise modified in another reaction. This idea of chain reactions in cellular processes laid the groundwork for understanding the complex series of operations in cellular respiration.
