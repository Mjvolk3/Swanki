## What is spherical aberration in optics and how does it affect microscopic observations?

Spherical aberration occurs because light rays that pass through a lens at different distances from the optical axis come into focus at different points. This results in a blurred or distorted image. 

In the context of microscopy, spherical aberration can significantly impair the resolution and clarity of the observed specimens, making it challenging to discern fine structural details. This was a major limitation for early microscopists.

## What is chromatic aberration and why was it problematic for early microscopy?

Chromatic aberration results from the fact that different wavelengths of light refract to different degrees when passing through a lens, causing each color to come into focus at different points. This disperses colors and leads to fringes of color around the image, further distorting the observation.

This was problematic for early microscopes because it could create misleading images of biological specimens, compounding the difficulty of accurately identifying and understanding microstructures.

## Describe Robert Hooke's observation and interpretation of cork using his microscope, as detailed in his 1665 book "Micrographia."

Robert Hooke observed that cork was perforated and porous, resembling a honeycomb with small cavities, which he termed "cells." He noted that these cavities were not very deep and consisted of many little boxes separated by continuations of what appeared to be long pores.

This led to the coining of the term "cell" in biology, though it was later realized that the living cells of plants and animals did not quite match the hollow chambers Hooke described.

## Explain the discrepancy between the term "cell" as used by Robert Hooke and the modern understanding of a biological cell.

Robert Hooke used the term "cell" to describe the small cavities he saw in cork, which appeared as hollow chambers surrounded by walls. The term "cell" was historically a misnomer because modern cells are not simply hollow spaces but complex structures containing various organelles.

E. B. Wilson critiqued the term, noting that the biological cell is far more intricate and not just a hollow chamber, reflecting the advanced understanding of cell structure by the end of the nineteenth century.
