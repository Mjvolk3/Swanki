## What was Liebig's assumption about animal processes and what did Claude Bernard discover that challenged it?

Liebig assumed that all processes in animals were catabolic, breaking down complex substances into simpler ones without creating anything new. However, Claude Bernard discovered that glycogen was being synthesized in animals, revealing the oversimplification in Liebig's scheme.

## What is Berzelius's contribution to the understanding of fermentation according to the text?

Berzelius coined the concept of a catalyst and assumed it would be straightforward to generate a chemical account of fermentation. However, the discovery by Schwann, Cagniard-Latour, and Kützing that yeast were living organisms complicated this view.

## According to the card, what was the initial view about chemical accounts of physiological processes and how did Wöhler respond to the findings that challenged this view?

The initial view was that physiological processes could be fully explained by chemical accounts. Wöhler, along with Liebig, responded harshly to findings such as the living nature of yeast by publishing satirical works that ridiculed these new ideas.

## How did Berzelius's and Liebig's presumptions affect their interpretation of fermentation in the context of physiology?

Berzelius and Liebig presumed that fermentation, like other physiological processes, could be entirely explained by chemistry without considering biological factors. This view was challenged by discoveries that yeast were living organisms, leading to a shift in the understanding of fermentation.
