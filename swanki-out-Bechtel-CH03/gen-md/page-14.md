## What phenomenon was key evidence pointing to the existence of cell membranes?

Osmosis was a key type of evidence pointing to the existence of cell membranes. Osmosis is the movement of water in and out of cells until the substances dissolved in it are equally distributed on both sides of the membrane.

## Explain the historical significance of the plasma membrane in the context of different cell organelles.

The plasma membrane surrounds the cell and plays a crucial role in organizing other parts and functions of the cell. This includes enclosing cell organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus. These organelles and their functions were subjects of significant scientific inquiry in the early twentieth century, particularly with advancements in microscopy techniques.

## Describe the contribution of William Hewson to the understanding of cell membranes.

William Hewson, a late eighteenth-century scientist, argued for the presence of an envelope surrounding red blood cells by showing their ability to shrink or swell. Although his research was not widely known in the nineteenth century, it laid foundational concepts that later contributed to the understanding of cell membranes.

## Discuss the advancements in light microscopy and their impact on cell biology in the early twentieth century.

The early twentieth century witnessed significant advancements in light microscopy, including the ultraviolet microscope and the phase contrast microscope. These advancements allowed cytologists to better understand cell structures and functions, although they were often limited by the tools available. These improvements paved the way for more detailed exploration of organelles like mitochondria, the ergastoplasm, and the Golgi apparatus in later decades.
