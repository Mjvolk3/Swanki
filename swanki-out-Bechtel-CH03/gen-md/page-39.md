## What is the role of phosphorylation in glycolysis according to the Embden scheme?

The Embden scheme illustrates the role of phosphorylated compounds throughout glycolysis. In particular, it shows the conversion of fructose diphosphate into two triosephosphates. One of these, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, undergoes oxidation to form phosphoglyceric acid, which surrenders its phosphate to produce pyruvic acid. This showcases the critical involvement of phosphorylation in the metabolic pathway.

## Describe the main steps and products in muscle glycolysis as proposed by Embden, including the significance of the phosphorylated intermediates.

In muscle glycolysis, as proposed by Embden, the process involves the following steps:
1. Fructose diphosphate is cleaved into two triosephosphates.
2. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is oxidized to form 3-phosphoglyceric acid.
3. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate is reduced to glycerophosphoric acid.
4. Phosphoglyceric acid releases its phosphate to form pyruvic acid.
5. Glycerophosphoric acid is oxidized to regenerate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate for reentry into the glycolysis pathway.

This highlights the importance of phosphorylated intermediates in the efficient transfer of energy and progression through the glycolytic pathway.

## What was Harden and Youngâ€™s contribution to understanding glycolysis, and how did Embden build upon their findings?

Harden and Young discovered the necessity of phosphates to maintain fermentation in a cell-free environment. Building on this, Embden (1933) proposed a glycolysis scheme that emphasized phosphorylated intermediates, suggesting a fundamental involvement of phosphorylated compounds throughout the glycolytic process.

## How did Jacob Parnas modify Embden's glycolysis scheme, and what was later determined about his modification?

Jacob Parnas proposed that the phosphate produced during the oxidation of triosephosphates was transferred to phosphocreatine rather than being liberated. However, it was later determined that the phosphate is actually transferred to ADP, forming ATP.
