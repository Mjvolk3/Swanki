## What was the primary function attributed to the Golgi apparatus by Kirkman and Severinghaus?

Kirkman and Severinghaus suggested that the Golgi apparatus serves as a condensation membrane for concentrating products into droplets or granules. 

$$
\text{Golgi apparatus} \rightarrow \text{Condensation membrane}
$$

These products, elaborated elsewhere and diffused into the cytoplasm, may include lipoids, yolk, bile constituents, enzymes, hormones, etc.

## What was Bowen's view on the role of the Golgi apparatus, and how did it contrast with Kirkman and Severinghaus' view?

Bowen argued that the Golgi apparatus was "a great intracellular center of chemical synthesis or enzyme formation."

$$
\text{Golgi apparatus} \rightarrow \text{Chemical synthesis or enzyme formation}
$$

This contrasts with Kirkman and Severinghaus' view that it acts primarily as a condensation membrane rather than a site of synthesis.

## How did the consensus regarding the Golgi apparatus' function evolve by 1940, and what challenges remained according to De Robertis, Nowinski, and Saez?

By 1940, a consensus was developing that the Golgi apparatus was a true component of the cell, primarily functioning in cell secretion. However, there were still significant challenges, as noted by De Robertis, Nowinski, and Saez:

$$
\text{Golgi apparatus} \rightarrow \text{Relationship with secretion} \text{ (hypothetical)}
$$

They pointed out that the functional significance of the Golgi apparatus in non-secreting cells and nerve cells remained particularly unclear.

## What major issue did Albert Claude and George Palade raise regarding the Golgi apparatus in 1949, and how did their views change over time?

In 1949, Albert Claude and George Palade argued that the Golgi apparatus was an artifact of staining. However, they eventually accepted the existence of the Golgi apparatus, and Palade made significant contributions to determining its function.

$$
\text{Golgi apparatus} \underset{earlier \ view}{\longrightarrow} \text{Artifact of staining}
$$
$$
\text{Golgi apparatus} \underset{later \ view}{\longrightarrow} \text{Accepted structure}
$$

Palade's later work contributed to a deeper understanding of the Golgi apparatus' role within cells.
