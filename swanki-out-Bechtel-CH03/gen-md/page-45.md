## Explain the primary oxidation reaction involved in the metabolic pathway described by Thunberg.

The primary oxidation reaction described by Thunberg is the dehydrogenation of succinic acid to fumaric acid. This reaction involves the removal of two hydrogen atoms from succinic acid.

$$
\mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{COOH} \rightarrow \mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{COOH}
$$

In this reaction, succinic acid ($\mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{COOH}$) is oxidized to fumaric acid ($\mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{COOH}$).

## What role did methylene blue play in Thunberg's experiments?

Methylene blue acted as a hydrogen acceptor in Thunberg's experiments. By removing all oxygen from the reaction environment, Thunberg demonstrated that methylene blue could substitute for molecular oxygen, getting reduced in the process.

When succinic acid was introduced to the oxygen-free environment containing minced muscle tissue and methylene blue, the dye was reduced, as evidenced by its rapid decolorization.

## Describe the transformation process from fumaric acid to malic acid as detailed in Thunberg's metabolic pathway.

The transformation process from fumaric acid to malic acid involves the hydration of fumaric acid. This process includes the addition of water to fumaric acid, specifically two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom from the water molecule.

$$
\mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{COOH} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}(\mathrm{OH})-\mathrm{COOH}
$$

In this reaction, fumaric acid ($\mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{COOH}$) is converted into malic acid ($\mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}(\mathrm{OH})-\mathrm{COOH}$).

## How did Warburg's interpretation of oxidation reactions differ from Thunberg's?

Warburg construed a reaction with oxygen as the key step in oxidation, focusing on the activation of oxygen as the major catalytic event. He argued that preparing oxygen to combine with substrates was central to the oxidation process.

Warburg's approach differed fundamentally from Thunberg's, who used methylene blue to show that oxidation reactions could occur independently of oxygen reduction. Warburg, instead, maintained that oxygen was essential to the oxidation process.
