## Define Schwann's proposal on cell and crystal formation drawing a parallel between these mechanisms.

Schwann proposed that a mechanism of attraction drew a particular kind of material out of the intercellular fluid, with each layer (the nucleolus, the nucleus, and the cytoplasm) drawing out different substances. He discounted the importance of differences between inorganic crystals and biological cells. What did Schwann say would happen if crystals were formed from the same substances as cells?

%
Schwann posited that if crystals were formed from the same substances as cells, they would probably be subject to the same conditions as cells. This comparison was used to highlight the mechanical nature of cell formation, paralleling it to the known mechanical process of crystal formation, not requiring any vital forces.

## What was the significant enzyme discovered by Schwann in his research on digestion?

Schwann discovered a specific enzyme in his earlier research on digestion. Name this enzyme.

%
In his earlier research on digestion, Schwann discovered pepsin, which was the first enzyme identified in animals. This discovery highlighted Schwann's commitment to chemical mechanisms for explaining vital phenomena.

## State Schwann's stance on fermentation and its implications for mechanistic physiology.

In 1837, Schwann presented evidence relating to fermentation. Explain Schwann's view on fermentation and its relationship to mechanistic versus vitalistic physiology.

%
Schwann presented evidence that fermentation was a process requiring living yeast cells. While some mechanists associated such a claim with vitalism, Schwann did not see himself as embracing vitalism. He later introduced fermentation as an example of the metabolic phenomena exhibited in cells, emphasizing that metabolic activities were due to the distinctive chemical constitution of cells, resulting from a mechanical process of cell formation.

## What does Schwann's cell theory propose about growth and cell vitality?

Explain Schwann's assertion about the locus of control for basic life functions in cells and how it relates to cell growth and independent vitality.

%
Schwann's cell theory proposed that the cell is the locus of control for basic life functions like nutrition. He argued that cells grow according to the same laws, implying the cause of growth cannot lie both in the cell and the whole organism. Schwann suggested that all cells possess an independent vitality, meaning the molecular combinations within any single cell enable it to set free the power required for growth.
