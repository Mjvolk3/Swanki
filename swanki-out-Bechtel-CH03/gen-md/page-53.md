## What was the accepted P:O ratio argued by Ochoa in 1943?
  
The accepted P:O (phosphate to oxygen) ratio argued by Ochoa in 1943 was three molecules of ATP formed per oxygen atom reduced.

## Describe the major challenge faced by researchers in explaining the linkage between oxidation and phosphorylation in the early 1940s.

Based on the example of fermentation, researchers assumed that intermediate phosphorylated compounds formed along the electron transport chain would transfer a high-energy phosphate bond to ADP. However, such compounds were never found.

## Why was membrane recognition important in the study of oxidative phosphorylation?

Keilin and Hartree (1940) discovered that membranes seemed to be required in any preparation that carried out oxidative phosphorylation. The recognition of the role of membranes was crucial because it was necessary for successful understanding and replication of the biochemical reaction.

## According to Efraim Racker in 1968, what problem was still facing the biochemistry of oxidative phosphorylation?

Efraim Racker noted that the mechanism of energy production in mitochondria defied analysis because a complex chemical pathway in a living organism cannot be fully understood until its intermediate products have been identified and each step's enzymes have been individually resolved as soluble components.
