## What did Garnier suggest about the ergastoplasm in relation to the nuclear sap or chromatic substance from the nucleolus?

Garnier suggested that the nuclear sap or chromatic substance from the nucleolus passed through the nuclear membrane and joined with the ergastoplasm.

## What experimental evidence did Regaud provide to support the existence of the ergastoplasm?

Regaud showed that when he added acetic acid to his fixative, the ergastoplasm appeared as Garnier reported, but mitochondria were not visible. If he left out the acetic acid, mitochondria appeared, but no ergastoplasm.

## Who proposed that the ergastoplasm was simply poorly fixed mitochondria, and how does this relate to other contemporaneous views?

Christian Champy (1911) proposed that the ergastoplasm was simply poorly fixed mitochondria. This view was in opposition to Morelle (1927), who denied that the ergastoplasm had a fibrillar structure and proposed that it was simply modified ground cytoplasm.

## What was the early history and methods associated with the discovery of the Golgi apparatus?

The Golgi apparatus was first systematically observed by Camillo Golgi in 1898, in Purkinje and ventral horn cells of the barn owl and the cat. He fixed cells with an osmium-tetroxide-potassium dichromate mixture followed by impregnation with silver salts.
