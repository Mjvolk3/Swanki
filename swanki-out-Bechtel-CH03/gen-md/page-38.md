## What leads to the release of about twice as much energy as an ordinary covalent bond in ATP?

The breaking of high-energy bonds in ATP leads to the release of about $14 \mathrm{kcal}$ of energy, which is approximately twice as much as the energy released from an ordinary covalent bond.

$$
\text{Energy released} = 14 \mathrm{kcal}

## Describe the chemical reaction involved in the rapid hydrolysis of ATP and its significance.

The rapid hydrolysis of ATP involves the loss of one phosphate group at a time, releasing considerable energy. This reaction plays a crucial role in cellular processes, including muscle glycolysis.

$$
\text{ATP} \rightarrow \text{ADP} + \text{P}_{\text{i}} + \text{energy}
$$

## {{c1::What happens to ATP in the presence of cyanide in pigeon erythrocytes, according to Englehardt's studies?}}

In the presence of cyanide, a respiratory inhibitor, ATP rapidly breaks down, and inorganic phosphate builds up. However, ATP is resynthesized after the cells are washed.
