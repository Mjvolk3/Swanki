## Describe a significant change in biochemistry emphasized by Frederic Holmes related to intermediary metabolism. 

Holmes emphasized that a significant change differentiating biochemistry from its predecessors was the conception of intermediary metabolism, which involves sequences of specific chemical reactions. The goal was to discover each intermediate reaction.

## What technique did Franz Knoop introduce in 1904 to demonstrate intermediate reactions?

Knoop introduced a technique where animals were fed compounds similar to normal foods but that they could not fully metabolize. This allowed the observation of intermediate products that accumulated in the urine.

## Why was it a challenge to produce empirical evidence for intermediate reactions in metabolic processes?

Because intermediate products generally did not accumulate and were immediately metabolized, it was difficult to produce empirical evidence for these steps.

## Which structural components of organic molecules were identified as relevant to metabolic processes by 1900?

By 1900, organic compounds relevant to metabolic processes could be characterized structurally. Characteristic groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups were identified as being linked at specific sites to the carbon backbones of organic molecules.
