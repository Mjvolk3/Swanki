## Discuss the process of endosmosis as characterized by Dutrochet in the context of cellular exchange.

Endosmosis is the process where nutrients and inflow of water are selectively admitted into the cell. This concept was first termed by Dutrochet (1826; 1828), signifying the unit of physiological exchange that selectively allows entrance to nutrients and water.

## Describe how the experiments by Wilhelm Pfeffer in 1887 contributed to our understanding of cell membranes.

Wilhelm Pfeffer proposed in 1887 that cells are surrounded by semipermeable membranes. This idea was influenced by previous works using artificial semipermeable membranes in osmometers constructed by Moritz Traube.

## Overton (1895; 1896; 1899) found an important characteristic about substances crossing cell membranes. What was the finding and why is it significant?

Charles Ernst Overton discovered that fat-soluble substances pass through cell membranes more easily than water-soluble substances. This finding indicated that cell membranes have a lipid nature, thus allowing these substances to permeate effectively.

## Explain the difference between endosmosis and exosmosis as described by Dutrochet. Include specific details about each process.

Endosmosis is the process of selectively admitting nutrients and water into the cell, whereas exosmosis is the diffusion of waste out of the cell. These processes were named by Dutrochet to describe the physiological exchanges occurring in cells.

$$\text{Exosmosis: Diffusion of waste out}$$
