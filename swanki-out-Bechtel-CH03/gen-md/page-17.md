## How did Richard Altmann observe filaments in the cytoplasm of cell types around 1890?

Altmann used improved fixation techniques such as a solution of potassium dichromate and osmium tetroxide. When combined with an acid-fuchsin stain differentiated by picric acid and delicate heating, this allowed him to observe filaments in the cytoplasm of nearly all cell types.

## Describe the specific metabolic processes that Altmann attributed to granules and his view on the structure of protoplasm. 

Altmann attributed basic metabolic processes, specifically fat metabolism and secretion, to these granules. He opposed the view that protoplasm has a uniform structure, instead maintaining that granules were the basic living unit.

## What was the central idea behind Altmann's "bioblasts," and how did it differ from modern mitochondrial understanding?

Altmann coined the term "bioblasts" to describe granules, which he considered equivalent to independently existing microorganisms. This differs from modern mitochondrial understanding, as mitochondria are now recognized as membrane-bound organelles involved in cellular respiration and energy production.

## What was the significance of the dictum "omne granulum e granulo," and how did it align with Virchow's dictum?

Altmann's dictum "omne granulum e granulo" ("every granule from another granule") aimed to extend Virchow's dictum "omnis cellula e cellula" ("every cell from another cell"). This reflected his belief that granules (bioblasts) were fundamental living units, similar to how cells were viewed as the basic unit of life.
