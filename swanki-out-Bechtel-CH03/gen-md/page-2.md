## How did Anton van Leeuwenhoek contribute to the development of microscopes and cell discovery?

Anton van Leeuwenhoek developed methods for grinding and polishing lenses, creating a single-lens microscope that magnified objects up to 270 times. Using this microscope, he identified small organisms, which he termed "animalcules," in blood, sperm, and water from marshes and ponds.

## Explain the main differences between cytology and biochemistry by 1940.

Cytology focused on the structural decomposition of tissues into cells and then organelles, while biochemistry emphasized the functional decomposition of metabolic activities down to individual biochemical reactions.

## What were the main limitations of cytology and biochemistry in understanding cell mechanisms according to Christian de Duve?

Christian de Duve pointed out that there was a "no-man's-land" between the smallest entity observable with the light microscope and the largest molecular size accessible to chemistry. This area remained unexplored, indicating significant limitations in both cytology and biochemistry in understanding cell mechanisms.

## Describe the historical roles of Robert Hooke, Nehemiah Grew, Marcello Malpighi, and Jan Swammerdam in the development of early microscopy.

Robert Hooke developed a compound microscope, while Nehemiah Grew, Marcello Malpighi, and Jan Swammerdam were other investigators of the period who reported looking at plant and animal tissue with microscopes, contributing crucial observations. Their collective works helped lay the foundation for the field of cytology.
