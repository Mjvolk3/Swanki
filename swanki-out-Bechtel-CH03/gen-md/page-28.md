## What was the significance of Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea in 1828? Include specific details about the substances he used.

Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea from ammonia and cyanic acid in 1828 was significant because it demonstrated that organic compounds could be synthesized from inorganic materials. This challenged the prevailing belief that organic compounds could only be produced by living organisms. 

Written in a letter to Berzelius, Wöhler exclaimed:

"I can make urea without needing a kidney, whether of man or dog."

The chemical reaction he achieved can be represented as:

$$\text{NH}_3 + \text{HNCO} \rightarrow \text{NH}_2\text{CONH}_2$$

where $\text{NH}_3$ is ammonia and $\text{HNCO}$ is cyanic acid.

## What classification of nutrients did William Prout propose in 1827, and how did this inspire Justus Liebig's work in Animal Chemistry?

William Prout classified the nutrients required by animals into three classes: saccharine (carbohydrates), oleaginous (fats), and albuminous (proteins). This classification inspired Justus Liebig's work in Animal Chemistry, where he formulated a scheme for the synthesis and breakdown of these nutrients in animal bodies.

Prout noted the minor differences in chemical composition between the nutrients from plants and the compounds in animal bodies, which Liebig used to hypothesize that animals could incorporate and break down these nutrients as needed for bodily functions.

## Describe Justus Liebig's hypothesis on how animals utilize proteins, carbohydrates, and fats in their bodies as detailed in his work "Animal Chemistry".

Justus Liebig hypothesized the following utilization scheme in animals, as detailed in his work "Animal Chemistry":

- Proteins: Liebig proposed that animals incorporate protein from their diet into their tissues and break down these proteins for muscle work, with waste products excreted.
- Carbohydrates and Fats: He believed animals burn these nutrients to generate heat. When insufficient oxygen was available, carbohydrates and fats were converted to fat and stored.

This hypothesis included the idea of breaking down proteins for muscle work and burning carbohydrates and fats for heat production, contributing to a general scheme of the chemical operations in animals.

## Why did Jacob Berzelius criticize Justus Liebig's "Animal Chemistry", despite its dedication to him?

Jacob Berzelius criticized Justus Liebig's "Animal Chemistry" for being overly speculative and not grounded in sufficient experimental evidence. Berzelius referred to it as "physiological chemistry... created at the writing table", implying that Liebig's detailed chemical formulae and hypotheses were more theoretical than empirically validated.

The criticism stemmed from skepticism about the detailed formulae and the synthetic nature of Liebig's chemical processes described in the book.
