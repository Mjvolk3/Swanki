## What major change marked the transition from physiological chemistry to biochemistry according to Robert Kohler?

Kohler emphasized that the transition from physiological chemistry to biochemistry was marked by the appeal to enzymes rather than protoplasm to explain processes in living organisms.

## What was Kohler's view on the identification of different enzymes and their role in biochemical processes?

Kohler emphasized the strategy of identifying different enzymes responsible for each reaction. He noted that while simple hydrolytic reactions were known, complex cell reactions like respiration or fermentation were not associated with enzymes until the late 1890s.

## How did Eduard Buchner's 1897 report contribute to the understanding of enzyme activity within cells?

Eduard Buchner's report in 1897 demonstrated that fermentation could occur in a cell-free extract made by grinding yeast cells with sand. This showed that enzymes could operate within cells and not just outside them.

## Describe Emil Fischer's lock-and-key model of enzyme action and its significance in the context of enzymes' highly specific nature.

Emil Fischer's lock-and-key model, proposed in 1894, illustrated that the highly specific nature of enzyme action involved the enzyme and substrate fitting together precisely like a key into a lock. This model was significant in revealing why enzymes are so specific in their biochemical reactions.

$$
E + S \rightleftharpoons ES \rightarrow E + P
$$

where $E$ represents the enzyme, $S$ the substrate, and $P$ the product.
