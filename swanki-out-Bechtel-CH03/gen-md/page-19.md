## What observations did Cowdry (1924) make about the shape of mitochondria in relation to cell injury?

Cowdry (1924) observed that the shape of mitochondria changes upon cell injury, serving as a delicate criterion for assessing various types of cell damage.

## What did the reactions of mitochondria with various reagents, such as acetic acid, alcohol, ether, and chloroform, suggest about their composition?

The solubility of mitochondria in acetic acid, alcohol, ether, and chloroform suggested a phospholipid constitution. Additionally, the failure to stain with Sudan III and Millon's reagent indicated that mitochondria did not contain significant amounts of fat or protein.

## What critical role did Kingsbury (1913) propose that mitochondria play, based on the fixatives used for their visualization?

Kingsbury (1913) proposed that mitochondria play a critical role in respiration, noting that the best visualization fixatives (osmic acid, potassium dichromate, and formalin) depend on reducing substances.

## Explain the relationship between the amount of mitochondria and cellular activity according to Cowdry (1924).

Cowdry (1924) noted a positive correlation between the amount of mitochondria in a cell and its level of activity (e.g., division, secretion). He also observed a negative correlation between the amount of mitochondria and the amount of fat in the cell, suggesting that decreased oxidation favors fat deposition and increased oxidation hastens fat elimination.
