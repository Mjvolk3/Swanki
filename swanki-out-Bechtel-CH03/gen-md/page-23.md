## Description of the Golgi Apparatus by Cowdry in 1924

What substances help in identifying the Golgi apparatus under a microscope, as mentioned by Cowdry in 1924?

The Golgi apparatus can be identified by its reactions to certain substances:
- Soluble in alcohol.
- Becomes blackened after prolonged treatment with osmic acid.
- Shows a marked affinity for silver salts after appropriate preliminary fixation.
- Occasionally stained with resorcin-fuchsin, iron hematoxylin, and other dyes.

## Structural Variability Across Cell Types

How did Cowdry in 1924 describe the variability of the Golgi apparatus across different cell types?

Cowdry (1924) reported that the Golgi apparatus has a relatively constant appearance within a particular cell type but varies significantly across different cell types. This variability in morphology is closely related to the differences in cellular organization and function.

## Descriptions and Forms of the Golgi Apparatus

List the various forms of the Golgi apparatus as described by Kirkman and Severinghaus in 1938.

The descriptions of the Golgi apparatus by Kirkman and Severinghaus (1938) include:
- Fibrous reticulum
- Network
- Ring
- Cylinder
- Very irregular fenestrated plate
- More or less incomplete hollow sphere, vesicle, or cup
- Collection of small spheres, rodlets, and platelets or discs
- Series of anastomosing canals
- Group of vacuoles
- Differentiated region of homogeneous cytoplasm crossed by irregular interfaces

## Cajal's Contribution to Golgi Apparatus Research

What correlation did Cajal note in his research on the Golgi apparatus, and what did he observe in intestinal goblet cells?

Cajal noted a correlation between the Golgi apparatus's presence in a cell and its secretory activity. He observed tiny droplets of mucus in the Golgi region of intestinal goblet cells that secrete mucus over the lining of the intestine.
