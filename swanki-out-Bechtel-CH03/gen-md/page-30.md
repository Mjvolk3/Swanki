## What was Pasteur's stance on the nature of fermentation according to the paper, and what did it suggest regarding chemical accounts?

Pasteur believed that "Fermentation is correlated to the vital processes of yeast." This stance suggested the futility of providing a purely chemical account of fermentation, as it emphasized the vital, living processes over chemical mechanisms.

## Describe the key contribution of Wilhelm Kühne in the context of fermentation research as per the text.

Wilhelm Kühne introduced the term "enzyme," derived from the Greek phrase for "in yeast." This term eventually became the general designation for chemical agents responsible for catalyzing reactions, distinguishing them from living organisms that produced chemical changes.

## What conflict did Lavoisier's research open regarding animal respiration, and which researchers were involved in this debate?

Lavoisier's research initiated a prolonged conflict about whether respiration occurred in the lungs (Lavoisier), blood (Liebig, Bernard), or tissues (Pflüger). Each proposed a different primary site for respiration, reflecting distinct biochemical perspectives.

## What was Eduard Pflüger's theory about the mechanism of respiration within tissues?

Eduard Pflüger proposed that the protoplasm of cells within tissues had a complex physical structure due to the polymerization of protein. He theorized that this structure stored energy, which could be released in explosive reactions involving the dissociation of albuminoid molecules into carbonic acid, water, and amide-like substances.
