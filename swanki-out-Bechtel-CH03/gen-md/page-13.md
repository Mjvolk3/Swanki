## What was the major success in describing mechanisms of cell life in the nineteenth century?

The major success in describing mechanisms of cell life in the nineteenth century was the research on mitosis and meiosis. Researchers identified the continuity of chromosomes from parents to offspring and the stages in the overall operation of splitting cells. For instance, Strasburger (1884) showed that offspring chromosomes originate half from each parent, and Flemming (1887) described chromosome reduction in sperm production.

## Explain Van Beneden's discovery related to chromosomal reduction during fertilization.

Van Beneden discovered that prior to fertilization, the chromosomes in both the egg and sperm nuclei were reduced in half through the process of meiosis. This reduction ensures that a full complement of chromosomes only reappears after fertilization of the egg. He demonstrated this using pronuclei in the nematode Ascaris maglocephala, in which he observed only two anses chromatiques instead of the typical four prior to fertilization.

## Describe how August Weisman contributed to the understanding of inheritance and the role of cell division.

August Weisman highlighted that the procedures of cell division ensure that daughter cells receive a complete set of hereditary material, drawing half from each parent. This insight set the stage for linking cell division to inheritance mechanisms, notably connecting to Mendel's work on dominant and recessive traits. Across cell generations, preservation and proper segregation of genes, known as Mendelian factors, during meiosis explain inheritance patterns.

## What is the relationship between Mendel's factors and chromosomes as established in the early 20th century?

Mendel's factors, rechristened genes, were linked to chromosomes. Researchers of the Morgan school developed the relationship further, discovering phenomena such as the crossing over of chromosomes during meiosis, which explained gene recombination. This work laid the foundation for modern genetics, illustrating that genes located on chromosomes control hereditary traits and ensuring that germ cells receive one of each pair of Mendel's factors.
