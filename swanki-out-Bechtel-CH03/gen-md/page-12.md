## What significant observation did Remak make about nuclear division in 1852 that contrasted with the behavior of cell membranes?

In 1852, Remak observed that the nucleus divided prior to cell division, but he noted that "Observations on the mechanisms of nuclear division are by no means so extensive as those on the behavior of the cell membranes" (translated by Harris, 1999, p. 139). 

This highlighted an early recognition of the nucleus's role in cell division, despite it being less understood compared to cell membrane behavior.

## What did Wilhelm Hofmeister observe in 1849 about the nuclear membrane and the structures inside the nucleus during cell division?

Wilhelm Hofmeister observed that the nuclear membrane dissolved before the cell divided. He noted that when cells were stained with iodine, discrete lumps, presumably chromosomes, could be seen. Hofmeister proposed these were protein coagulates, and he reported that a granular mucilage formed around these lumps and divided into two, with a membrane forming around each as the cell divided.

## What technological advancements in the 1870s and 1880s allowed for significant progress in research on nuclear processes in cell division?

The availability of fixatives, stains, and apochromatic lenses in the 1870s and 1880s enabled significant advancements in research on nuclear processes in cell division. These tools allowed scientists to better observe and characterize the structures and dynamics involved in nuclear division, such as the structures labeled as chromatin by Flemming and the characterization of spindles by Edouard van Beneden.

## How did Walther Flemming's work in 1878-1879 contribute to the understanding of nuclear division and what new terms did he introduce?

Walther Flemming developed new fixatives, such as a mixture of chromic, osmic, and glacial acetic acids, known as Flemming's solution, to better reveal details of nuclear division. He observed that chromatin (chromosomes) responded to these stains, contrasting with unstained structures he labeled as achromatin. Flemming noted that the rods (chromosomes) split lengthwise and proposed that one half went to each daughter cell. To describe the complex sequence of events, he introduced the terms "indirect nuclear division" and "Karyomitose."
