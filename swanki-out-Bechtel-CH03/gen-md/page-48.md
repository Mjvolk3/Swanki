## Explain Thunberg's proposed reaction converting acetic acid into succinic acid.

The reaction Thunberg proposed involves the transformation of two acetic acid molecules ($CH_3COOH$) into succinic acid ($COOH-CH_2-CH_2-COOH$) and hydrogen gas ($H_2$):

$$
2 \mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{COOH} \rightarrow \mathrm{COOH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{COOH} + \mathrm{H}_{2}
$$

Thunberg suggested that two acetate molecules each lose one hydrogen atom, leading to the joining of their carbon chains into one. This reaction forms succinic acid as the product.

## What is the role of four-carbon dicarboxylic acids in Szent-Györgyi's proposed scheme?

Albert Szent-Györgyi proposed that four-carbon dicarboxylic acids perform as intermediate hydrogen carriers rather than steps in the oxidation of carbohydrates:

$$\text{Hydrogendonors} \rightarrow \text{oxaloacetate} \rightarrow \text{malate} \rightarrow \text{fumarate} \rightarrow \text{succinate} \rightarrow \text{cytochrome} \rightarrow \text{oxygen}$$

This pathway suggests that these acids are involved in transporting hydrogen ions rather than directly facilitating carbohydrate catabolism.

## Describe the core of Thunberg’s idea that was incorporated into the citric acid cycle by Hans Krebs and William Johnson.

Fifteen years after Thunberg’s proposal, Hans Krebs and William Johnson incorporated the core idea into the citric acid cycle. The key transformation they adopted involves the conversion of acetic acid into a series of intermediates leading to succinic acid. Krebs and Johnson’s cycle elaborated the detailed sequence of reactions including hydrations, dehydrogenations, and decarboxylations.

The citric acid cycle is now recognized for transforming acetyl-CoA through a series of chemical reactions to produce energy intermediates.

## What is the significance of the reaction pathway starting from succinic acid to acetic acid mentioned in the paper?

The sequential reaction pathway presented in the paper delineates the flow of metabolic intermediates:

$$
\text{Succinic acid} \rightarrow \text{fumaric acid} \rightarrow \text{malic acid} \rightarrow \text{oxaloacetic acid} \rightarrow \text{pyruvic acid} \rightarrow \text{acetic acid}
$$

The significance of this pathway is that it illustrates a series of conversions central to metabolic processes, such as cellular respiration and the citric acid cycle, highlighting the transformation of substrates through enzymatic actions to produce vital cellular energy.
