## Explain the controversy between Schwann's and Schleiden's mechanism for cell formation and the observations made by researchers like Dumortier and von Mohl.

Schwann and Schleiden contended that cells formed like crystals, which led to controversy. However, researchers such as Dumortier (1832) and von Mohl (1837) observed cell division in Conferva aurea, providing evidence against Schwann's mechanism.

Barthélemy Dumortier and Hugo von Mohl reported cell division observations, where nucleus division precedes cell division, conflicting with Schwann's account.

## What decisive argument did Rudolf Virchow and Robert Remak provide against Schwann's account of cell formation?

Virchow (1858) and Remak (1852; 1855) argued that Schwann's account amounted to spontaneous generation. Instead, Virchow contended that each cell arises from a pre-existing cell, a concept summarized by the phrase "omnis cellula e cellula."

$$\text{omnis cellula e cellula}$$

## What is the significance of the phrase "omnis cellula e cellula" and who first employed it?

The phrase "omnis cellula e cellula" asserts that all cells arise from pre-existing cells, refuting the idea of spontaneous generation. Although popularized by Rudolf Virchow, François-Vincent Raspail first used it in 1825 as an epigraph.

## What role did Virchow believe cells played in pathology, and how did he describe his approach?

Virchow viewed the difference between healthy and pathological life as involving organizational properties of whole cells. He characterized his approach to pathology as "cellular pathology."

"Cellular pathology" emphasizes that the cause of nutrition and growth resides in the separate elementary parts—cells.
