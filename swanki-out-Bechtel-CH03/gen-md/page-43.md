## Describe the Wieland schema for oxidation of a compound $\mathrm{RH}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{R}$.

Wieland proposed the following schema for oxidation of a compound $\mathrm{RH}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{R}$ (where $\mathrm{Pd}$ designates palladium, the catalyst, and $\mathrm{Mb}$ designates methylene blue, the dye):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{RH}_{2} + \mathrm{Pd} &\rightarrow \mathrm{R} + \mathrm{PdH}_{2} \\
\mathrm{PdH}_{2} + \mathrm{Mb} &\rightarrow \mathrm{Pd} + \mathrm{MbH}_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

This indicates that $\mathrm{RH}_{2}$ is oxidized by transferring hydrogen to palladium, and subsequently, the hydrogen is transferred to methylene blue.

## How did Otto Heinrich Wieland explain the oxidation of substrates that lacked two removable hydrogen atoms?

When a substrate such as an aldehyde (RCHO) lacked two removable hydrogen atoms, Wieland proposed a two-step process involving hydration (addition of water) followed by oxidation:

$$
\mathrm{RCHO} + \mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{RCH}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{RCOOH} + \mathrm{H}_{2}
$$

Starting with an aldehyde, the substrate is hydrated to form a geminal diol (RCH(OH)2), which is then oxidized, releasing two hydrogen atoms and forming a carboxylic acid (RCOOH).

## What did Heinrich Otto Wieland propose about the role of oxygen in biological oxidation?

Wieland suggested that in biological systems, oxygen, when present, serves as the substance that is reduced, forming hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$. An enzyme called catalase quickly converts $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to water:

$$
2 \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{O}_2
$$

Furthermore, he demonstrated that in the absence of oxygen, biological oxidation could still proceed given the presence of a suitable hydrogen acceptor such as methylene blue.

## What is the significance of Wieland's oxidation scheme for biological oxidation?

Wieland's scheme reconceptualized oxidation as dehydrogenation (removal of hydrogen) rather than the addition of oxygen. He illustrated that the oxidation process involves a coupled reaction in which the hydrogen removed from the oxidized substance is accepted by another substance that is reduced. This dual reaction exemplifies that biological oxidation and reduction are tightly linked processes:

$$
\mathrm{Reduction}\colon \text{Substance accepts } \mathrm{H} \\
\mathrm{Oxidation}\colon \text{Substance donates } \mathrm{H}
$$

This coupling was vital to understanding metabolic pathways, such as ethanol and acetaldehyde converting to acetic acid under anaerobic conditions using methylene blue as a hydrogen acceptor.
