## What happens to pyruvic acid in anaerobic environments and how is it different from aerobic conditions?

In anaerobic environments, pyruvic acid is reduced to lactic acid or to alcohol with the liberation of carbon dioxide. In aerobic conditions, pyruvic acid is decarboxylated, further oxidized, and combined with coenzyme A (CoA-SH) to produce acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle.

## What is the role of coenzyme A in the decarboxylation of pyruvic acid during aerobic respiration?

In aerobic conditions, pyruvic acid is decarboxylated, further oxidized, and combined with coenzyme A (CoA-SH) to form acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA then enters the citric acid cycle.

$$
\text{Pyruvic Acid} + \text{CoA-SH} \rightarrow \text{Acetyl-CoA} + \text{CO}_2
$$

## Explain the concept of glycolysis as proposed by Meyerhof and its significance in metabolic pathways.

Glycolysis refers to the metabolic pathway wherein glucose is broken down to pyruvic acid. Meyerhof's proposal indicated that each step in glycolysis is catalyzed by a specific enzyme, making glycolysis an exemplar of understanding physiological processes in biochemical terms.

## What historical distinction did researchers make between fermentation and aerobic cellular respiration?

In the nineteenth century, researchers distinguished fermentation as occurring under anaerobic conditions, while aerobic cellular respiration was associated with the oxidation of foodstuffs to carbon dioxide and water. Aerobic cellular respiration was often linked to processes in the protoplasm.
