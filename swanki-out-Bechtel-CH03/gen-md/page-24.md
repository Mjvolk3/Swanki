## Explain the significance of the Golgi apparatus in cell secretion as proposed by Robert Bowen.

Bowen defended the idea that the Golgi apparatus centralizes in cell secretion, noting that granules for secretion appear in the Golgi and then separate from it in varied ways across different tissue types.

## Describe the main argument by Strangeways and Canti regarding the Golgi apparatus and the counterargument presented by Richardson.

Strangeways and Canti argued that the Golgi apparatus was an artifact of staining, as they couldnâ€™t observe it in unstained cells. Richardson countered this by finding evidence in cultured cells and proposing that the Golgi apparatus was fragmented in the cells observed by Strangeways and Canti.

## State the primary claim made by Maurice Parat about the Golgi apparatus. How did John Baker expand on this claim?

Maurice Parat claimed that the Golgi apparatus observed in cells was an artifact created when fixatives caused cytoplasmic vacuoles to coalesce. John Baker expanded on this by suggesting that the artifact was produced by metal deposition on the vacuole periphery during cell preparation.

## Assess the evidence provided by Beams and King regarding the nature of the Golgi apparatus through their experiments.

Beams and King demonstrated the fluid or semifluid character of the Golgi apparatus by using a centrifuge to make it appear to stream through the cytoplasm in guinea pig uterine gland cells. Bourne accepted this as evidence that the Golgi apparatus is a definitive cell organelle.
