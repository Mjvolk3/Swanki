## Explain how the reactions in the left-hand column of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway contribute to glycolysis.

The reactions in the left-hand column of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway of glycolysis are often characterized as preliminary. These reactions are responsible for transferring energy from ATP to products of glucose and splitting the molecule into two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

## What role does NADH play in the Embden-Meyerhof pathway?

NADH takes over the role of glycerophosphoric acid in Embden's scheme, serving as the hydrogen donor in the reduction of pyruvic acid to lactic acid in muscle glycolysis and to alcohol in alcoholic fermentation.

## Explain the reduction process involving dihydroxyacetone phosphate and NADH in glycolysis.

In glycolysis, dihydroxyacetone phosphate is reduced (taking up two hydrogen atoms) in conjunction with the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, resulting in the formation of $\mathrm{NADH} + \mathrm{H}^{+}$.

$$
\text{Dihydroxyacetone phosphate} + 2\ \text{H} \rightarrow \mathrm{NADH} + \mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

## Describe the historical significance of the terms NAD and NADP and their adoption.

The terms nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) were adopted in the 1960s as part of an international agreement. Previously, the phosphate radical found in triphosphopyridine nucleotide (TPN) was also known as coenzyme II.
