### Card 1

### Describe the method used by Battelli and Stern (1911) to measure the oxidation of succinic acid. 

Battelli and Stern (1911) added metabolic substrates to suspensions of minced animal tissue, which presumably contained enzymes of interest. They used manometers to supply oxygen gas and measured its absorption during the oxidation reactions.

### Card 2

### Explain the main difference in the conceptualization of oxidation between Battelli and Stern’s and Thunberg’s approach as shown in Figure 3.12.

Battelli and Stern assumed that activated oxygen was added directly to the substrate, succinic acid, resulting in malic acid. Thunberg, on the other hand, recognized fumaric acid as an intermediate and incorporated paired reduction-oxidation reactions, positing specific enzymes as well as the carrier coenzyme FAD rather than molecular oxygen as the immediate hydrogen acceptor.

### What intermediate compound did Hans Einbeck (1914) identify in the oxidation of succinic acid?

Following the experiments by Battelli and Stern, Hans Einbeck (1914) demonstrated that fumaric acid was created in the process of oxidizing succinic acid.

### Card 4

### What enzyme did Battelli and Stern name, and why was its naming significant?

Battelli and Stern named the enzyme succinoxydone. The significance of this naming lies in the alternative to the traditional enzyme name ending of -ase, since succinoxydone was not soluble.
