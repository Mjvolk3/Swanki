## Discuss William Bate Hardy's criticism of Altmann's reliance on fixatives like osmic acid.

Hardy criticized Altmann's use of fixatives, stating that these reagents are coagulants of organic colloids and produce precipitates with varying structures depending on the reagent used.

## Explain Carl Benda's contribution to the study of Altmann's structures and the term "mitochondria."

Carl Benda used crystal violet to stain Altmann's structures and named them mitochondria. He observed these structures in both fixed and living cells, reducing the plausibility that they were artifacts of fixation.

## How did Michaelis's experiment with Janus Green dye contribute to understanding the function of mitochondria?

Michaelis showed that Janus Green dye turns blue-green in the presence of mitochondria in living cells, suggesting that mitochondria have the capacity to oxidize substrates, which was a clue to their role in cellular respiration.
