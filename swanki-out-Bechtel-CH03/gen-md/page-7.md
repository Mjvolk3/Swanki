## Schwann's Contributions to Cell Theory

Discuss the significance of Schwann's drawings in the context of cell theory.

Schwann's drawings, particularly in Figure 3.2, provide critical empirical support for the cell theory, demonstrating the universality of the cell as the fundamental unit of life across diverse biological organisms, including plants and animals.

## Significance of Schwann's Microscopy Work

Explain why Schwann’s microscopic research was seminal for the understanding of biological structures and growth.

Schwann’s microscopic research was seminal because it provided concrete visual evidence of cellular structures in both plants and animals, supporting the universality of the cell theory. Schwann showed that tissues from various species, such as the cartilage of Rana esculenta (frog) and the crystalline lenses of a fetal pig, share a fundamental cellular organization.
