## The original proposal for the steps in alcoholic fermentation 

Who originally proposed that alcoholic fermentation was a two-step process, and what were the proposed enzymes involved? 

Buchner and Meisenheimer (1904) proposed that alcoholic fermentation is a two-step process. The enzymes involved were zymase, which catalyzes the reaction from glucose to lactic acid, and lactacidase, which catalyzes the reaction from lactic acid to alcohol.

## The role of lactic acid in muscle action

How did Fletcher and Hopkins in 1907 contribute to the understanding of the role of lactic acid in muscle action? 

Fletcher and Hopkins (1907) showed that the formation of lactic acid during anaerobic muscle contraction was followed by its removal in the aerobic phase. This was pivotal in understanding the biochemical processes associated with muscle action and linked lactic acid formation to both anaerobic and aerobic phases of muscle activity.

## Pyruvic acid as an intermediary in fermentation

What was Otto Neubauer’s contribution to understanding the intermediaries in alcoholic fermentation, and how did it impact later research? 

Otto Neubauer identified pyruvic acid as an intermediary in amino acid metabolism and proposed that it also figured in alcoholic fermentation (Neubauer & Fromherz, 1911). This finding was quickly corroborated and was significant because pyruvic acid was found to be decarboxylated to yield acetaldehyde, a crucial step in the fermentation pathway.

## Neuberg’s comprehensive model of alcohol generation from glucose

What comprehensive model did Carl Neuberg develop for generating alcohol from glucose, and what were the key steps involved? 

Carl Neuberg, along with Kerb, in 1914 developed a comprehensive model involving a sequence of reactions to explain the generation of alcohol from glucose. The model proposed that glucose was scissioned into two molecules each of methylglyoxal and water. The methylglyoxal then reacted with acetaldehyde (produced in a previous iteration of the process) and water, thereby generating both pyruvic acid and alcohol. The pyruvic acid was then decarboxylated to produce acetaldehyde.

$$
\text{Glucose} \xrightarrow[\text{scission}]{\text{enzymes}} \text{Methylglyoxal} + \text{Water}
$$
$$
\text{Methylglyoxal} + \text{Acetaldehyde} + \text{Water} \rightarrow \text{Pyruvic Acid} + \text{Alcohol}
$$
$$
\text{Pyruvic Acid} \xrightarrow{\text{decarboxylation}} \text{Acetaldehyde} 
$$
