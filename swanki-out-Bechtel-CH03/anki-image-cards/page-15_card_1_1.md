A typical phospholipid molecule consists of a hydrophilic (water-attracting) head and a hydrophobic (water-repelling) tail. The hydrophilic head includes a phosphate group and other components that interact with water, while the hydrophobic tail is made up of long fatty acid chains that repel water. This structural arrangement is essential for forming cell membranes, where phospholipids align into a bilayer with hydrophilic heads outward and hydrophobic tails inward, creating a selective barrier for substance movement.

## Who characterized the physiological exchange units in phospholipids, and what terms did they use for inflow and outflow processes?

Dutrochet (1826; 1828) characterized the physiological exchange units in phospholipids, describing them as selectively admitting nutrients along with water inflow (endosmosis) and excreting waste with diffusion outflow (exosmosis). Carl Wilhelm von NÃ¤geli and Carl Cramer (1855) described osmosis in plant cells.
