The Embden-Meyerhof pathway of glycolysis is a series of enzymatic reactions that convert glucose into pyruvic acid. The pathway is divided into two main phases:

1. **Preparatory Phase (Left Column)**
   - Glucose is phosphorylated and converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
   - ATP is consumed during this phase.

2. **Payoff Phase (Right Column)**
   - Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate undergoes oxidation to form pyruvic acid.
   - ATP is generated, and NAD+ is reduced to NADH.

Thus, glycolysis involves the breakdown of glucose through various intermediates, with an overall yield of ATP and NADH.

## What major biochemical transformations occur in the preparatory and payoff phases of the glycolysis pathway?

**Preparatory Phase (Left Column)**
- Glucose is phosphorylated by ATP to produce fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
- This phase consumes two ATP molecules and results in the formation of two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

**Payoff Phase (Right Column)**
- Each glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is oxidized, reducing NAD+ to NADH.
- ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation, resulting in the formation of pyruvic acid.
- Overall, four ATP molecules are generated, leading to a net gain of two ATP molecules.
