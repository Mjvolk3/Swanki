Explain Harden and Young's conceptualization of how phosphates might figure in fermentation as depicted in the image.

%

Harden and Young's conceptualization of phosphate involvement in fermentation includes the following steps:

1. Two molecules of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) react with two phosphate molecules (generic formula R₂HPO₄).
2. This reaction produces two molecules of carbon dioxide (CO₂), two molecules of water (H₂O), one hexosediphosphate (C₆H₁₀O₄(PO₄R₂)₂), and two molecules of ethanol (C₂H₅OH).
3. The hexosediphosphate slowly breaks down, releasing two molecules of water and regenerating the phosphates, which are then available to react again with glucose.

This cyclic pathway emphasizes that phosphates are regenerated and reused, stimulating continuous fermentation without the accumulation of intermediates like hexosediphosphate.

The products obtained are:

1. Two molecules of carbon dioxide (CO₂)
2. Two molecules of water (H₂O)
3. One molecule of hexosediphosphate (C₆H₁₀O₄(PO₄R₂)₂)
4. Two molecules of ethanol (C₂H₅OH)
