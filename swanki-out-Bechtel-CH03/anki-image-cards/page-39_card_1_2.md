In Embden's conceptualization of glycolysis, phosphorylated intermediates play a crucial role in the stepwise conversion of fructose diphosphate into pyruvic acid. The process begins with the scission of fructose diphosphate into two triosephosphates: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (which gets oxidized) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (which gets reduced). The oxidation product, phosphoglyceric acid, eventually surrenders its phosphate to produce pyruvic acid, highlighting the significance of phosphorylated intermediates in the metabolic pathway.

## According to Embden's representation, what are the major intermediates involved in the conversion of fructose diphosphate to pyruvic acid in glycolysis?

The major intermediates in Embden's representation of glycolysis include:

1. Fructose diphosphate (C6H10O4(PO4H2)2)
2. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (C3H5O2(PO4H2))
3. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (C3H5O2(PO4H2))
4. Phosphoglyceric acid (C3H5O3(PO4H2))
5. Pyruvic acid (C3H4O3)

These intermediates are involved in the scission, oxidation, and subsequent phosphorylation steps that lead to the formation of pyruvic acid.
