    Battelli and Stern (1907-14) assumed that activated oxygen (O$_2$) is directly added to the substrate, succinic acid, to produce malic acid. This model involves a single oxidation step facilitated by an enzyme named "succinoxydone."

### Card 2

    How does Thunberg's 1916 model of succinic acid metabolism differ from that of Battelli and Stern?

    Thunberg's 1916 model introduces more steps and an intermediate, fumaric acid. Succinic acid is first oxidized to fumaric acid by the enzyme "succino-dehydrogenase," releasing two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogen atoms are then accepted by oxygen and form water via hydrogen peroxide (H$_2$O$_2$). Fumaric acid is then hydrated by adding a water molecule through the enzyme "fumarase" to produce malic acid.
