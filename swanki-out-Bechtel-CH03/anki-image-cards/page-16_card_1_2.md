The Danielli-Davson "sandwich" model of membrane structure describes a lipid bilayer where protein layers are present on the outer surfaces. The key components include:

- **Proteins:** Represented by jagged lines at the top and bottom, indicating protein layers on the exterior of the bilayer.
- **Hydrophilic Heads:** Circular heads with a zigzag pattern beneath the protein layers, representing the water-attracting parts of phospholipid molecules.
- **Hydrophobic Tails:** Straight lines extending downward from the hydrophilic heads, representing the water-repelling parts of the phospholipid molecules.

In this model, proteins are not embedded within the membrane but coat its surfaces, differentiating it from more modern interpretations of membrane structure.

What distinguishes proteins' arrangement in the Danielli-Davson model from more modern membrane models?

In the Danielli-Davson "sandwich" model, proteins are arranged as continuous layers coating the outer surfaces of the lipid bilayer. This model differs from modern interpretations, such as the fluid mosaic model, where proteins are embedded within the lipid bilayer, allowing for more dynamic interactions and mobility.
