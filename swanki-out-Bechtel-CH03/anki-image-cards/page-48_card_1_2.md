What is the reaction pathway illustrated in Figure 3.13 for cellular respiration?

%

The reaction pathway illustrated is:

$$
\text{Succinic acid} \rightarrow \text{Fumaric acid} \rightarrow \text{Malic acid} \rightarrow \text{Oxaloacetic acid} \rightarrow \text{Pyruvic acid} \rightarrow \text{Acetic acid}
$$

However, it was problematic to remove two hydrogen atoms from acetic acid.

How are Wieland's and Warburg's theories integrated in the context of cellular respiration as per the schematic in Figure 3.13?

%

Wieland's account focused on dehydrogenation while Warburg's proposal involved an enzyme acting on molecular oxygen. In the integrated pathway, dehydrogenase enzymes enable the separation of hydrogen from the substrate, while Atmungsferment activates oxygen to combine with hydrogen, producing water ($\text{2H} + \frac{1}{2}O_2 \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}$).
