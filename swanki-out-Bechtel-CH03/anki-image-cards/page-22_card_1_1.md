The drawing by Camillo Golgi depicts the internal reticular apparatus in a Purkinje cell of a barn owl. This structure, visualized using Golgi's staining techniques in 1898, is known today as the Golgi apparatus. It exemplifies the early scientific efforts to identify and understand the intricacies of cellular components.

Golgi's drawing is significant as it represents one of the earliest visualizations of the internal reticular apparatus within nerve cells, which we now know as the Golgi apparatus. This work, from his 1898 paper "Sur la structure des cellules nerveuses," marks a pivotal point in cellular biology and neuroscience, showcasing the advancement of staining techniques to reveal cellular details.
