The main purpose of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecule is to store and transport chemical energy within cells. When its high-energy bonds are broken, it releases a significant amount of energy ($14 \text{ kcal}$), which is used to power various cellular processes.

The three main components of an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecule are:
1. Adenine base (a multi-ring nitrogen-carbon structure)
2. Ribose sugar (a five-carbon ring structure)
3. Phosphate groups (a chain of three phosphates connected by high-energy bonds)
