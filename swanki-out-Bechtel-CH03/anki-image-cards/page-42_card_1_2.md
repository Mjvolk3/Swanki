The three alternative metabolic pathways that pyruvic acid can follow are:

1. **Conversion to lactic acid**: Occurs in anaerobic conditions, regenerating 2 NAD⁺ from 2 NADH + 2 H⁺.
2. **Conversion to ethanol and carbon dioxide (CO₂)**: Occurs in anaerobic conditions (such as alcoholic fermentation), regenerating 2 NAD⁺ from 2 NADH + 2 H⁺.
3. **Conversion to acetyl-CoA**: Involves a decarboxylation step in aerobic conditions, releasing CO₂ and generating NADH from NAD⁺, leading to entry into the citric acid cycle.

Under aerobic conditions, pyruvic acid is decarboxylated, further oxidized, and combined with coenzyme A (CoA-SH) to produce acetyl-CoA. This acetyl-CoA then enters the citric acid cycle. This process also leads to the generation of NADH from NAD⁺.
