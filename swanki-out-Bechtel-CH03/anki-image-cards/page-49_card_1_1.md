The described cycle, often referred to as the Krebs cycle or citric acid cycle, plays a critical role in cellular respiration. The cycle begins with the combination of oxaloacetic acid and a three-carbon substance, likely pyruvate, to form citric acid. The citric acid then undergoes a series of transformations to produce succinic acid, releasing molecules like CO2 and H2 along the way. These steps generate intermediates and energy carriers essential for the cell's metabolic processes, notably in ATP production.

## What role does pyruvic acid play in the cycle of reactions proposed by Krebs and Thunberg?

Pyruvic acid, or pyruvate, functions as a crucial reactant that combines with oxaloacetic acid at the beginning of the cycle. This union results in the formation of citric acid, which will subsequently undergo a series of transformations through various metabolic intermediates such as malic acid, fumaric acid, and succinic acid. These reactions are part of cellular respiration, crucial for energy production.
