The diagram illustrates the biochemical process of cellular respiration, integrating the theories of Wieland and Warburg. It depicts a reaction pathway where dehydrogenase enzymes activate hydrogen, enabling its separation from the substrate. Concurrently, Atmungsferment (related to Warburg's theory) activates oxygen, allowing it to combine with hydrogen to form water. The pathway involves succinic acid transforming sequentially into fumaric acid, malic acid, oxaloacetic acid, pyruvic acid, and finally acetic acid.

## What is the role of dehydrogenase enzymes in the reaction pathway shown in Figure 3.13?

Dehydrogenase enzymes in the depicted pathway activate hydrogen, allowing its separation from the substrate. This activation is crucial for the dehydrogenation process where hydrogen is removed from compounds such as succinic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, oxaloacetic acid, and pyruvic acid during cellular respiration.
