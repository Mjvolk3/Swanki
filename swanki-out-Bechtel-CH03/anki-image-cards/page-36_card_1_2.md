The pathway of fermentation proposed by Neuberg and Kerb involves the conversion of glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) into methylglyoxal ($C_3H_4O_2$), which subsequently transforms into pyruvic acid ($C_3H_4O_3$) and alcohol ($C_2H_5OH$). Pyruvic acid is then decarboxylated into acetaldehyde ($C_2H_4O$), generating $CO_2$ in the process. This pathway forms a cycle, where acetaldehyde can react again with methylglyoxal, emphasizing the cyclical nature of the fermentation process. The significance of this pathway lies in its detailed mechanism, prompting extensive research to verify the involvement of intermediates like methylglyoxal.

The decarboxylation of pyruvic acid ($C_3H_4O_3$) in Neuberg and Kerb's fermentation pathway forms acetaldehyde ($C_2H_4O$) and releases carbon dioxide ($CO_2$).
