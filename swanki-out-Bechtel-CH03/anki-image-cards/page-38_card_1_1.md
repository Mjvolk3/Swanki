The chemical structure of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) consists of three main components:

1. **Adenine Base**: A multi-ring structure composed of nitrogen and carbon atoms.
2. **Ribose Sugar**: A five-carbon ring structure connected to adenine.
3. **Phosphate Groups**: Three phosphate groups connected in a chain with high-energy bonds (indicated as $\sim$).

## How much energy is released when a high-energy bond in ATP is broken?

When a high-energy bond (indicated as $\sim$) in ATP is broken, it releases approximately $14 \text{ kcal}$ of energy, which is about twice as much as the energy released from an ordinary covalent bond.
