Which cycle of reactions did Krebs propose to explain the formation of citric acid and succinic acid?

%

Krebs proposed that oxaloacetic acid combines with a three-carbon substance, temporarily called triose (later identified as pyruvic acid), to generate citric acid. This citric acid then undergoes a sequence of reactions resulting in succinic acid, as described in the Krebs cycle or citric acid cycle.

Which major acids are involved in the cycle depicted in the provided diagram?

%

The major acids involved in the cycle depicted in the diagram include:
- Acetic acid (C2H4O2)
- Oxaloacetic acid (C4H4O5)
- Malic acid (C4H6O5)
- Fumaric acid (C4H4O4)
- Succinic acid (C4H6O4)

This cycle is representative of the transformations in the Krebs cycle or citric acid cycle.
