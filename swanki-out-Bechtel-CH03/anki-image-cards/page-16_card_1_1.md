The Danielli-Davson "sandwich" model proposed that the cell membrane consists of a phospholipid bilayer with hydrophilic (water-attracting) heads facing outward and hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails facing inward. Additionally, the model included protein layers coating the outer surfaces of the bilayer, depicted as jagged lines in the diagram. These proteins were not embedded within the membrane but rather on its exterior surfaces.

### What role do proteins play in the Danielli-Davson model of membrane structure?

In the Danielli-Davson model, proteins are located on the outer surfaces of the lipid bilayer and are not embedded within the membrane itself. These protein layers coat the exterior surfaces, as indicated by the jagged lines in the diagram, and form part of the "sandwich" structure of the membrane, providing an additional layer outside the phospholipid bilayer.
