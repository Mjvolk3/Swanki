The Embden-Meyerhof pathway of glycolysis, as depicted in the image, can be divided into two main stages:
1. **Preparatory Phase**: Energy is transferred from ATP to glucose, resulting in the formation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. This phase involves phosphorylation and the splitting of the glucose molecule.
2. **Payoff Phase**: This phase includes the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and subsequent energy transfer to ATP. Key steps here are the reduction of NAD+ to NADH and the generation of ATP.

The glycolysis pathway involves the following energy-carrying molecules:
1. **Initial Stage (Preparatory Phase)**:
   - **ATP**: ATP donates phosphate groups to the glucose intermediates.
2. **Subsequent Stage (Payoff Phase)**:
   - **NAD+**: Reduced to NADH.
   - **ATP**: Generated from ADP during substrate-level phosphorylation.
