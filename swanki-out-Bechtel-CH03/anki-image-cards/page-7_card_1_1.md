Schwann's drawings illustrate both plant and animal cells, highlighting key structures such as the nucleus and cytoplasm. Below are the main features:

- **Plant Cells:**
  - **Figure 1:** Onion parenchymatous cellular tissue with visible cell nuclei labeled 'a'.
  - **Figures 2-3:** Pollen grains from *Rhipsalis salicornoides* with noticeable granules.
  - **Figure 14:** Grass epidermis cells, possibly showcasing the plant cuticle or other cellular features.

- **Animal Cells:**
  - **Figure 4:** Chorda dorsalis cells from *Cyprinus erythrophthalmus* (ray-finned fish) with visible nuclei.
  - **Figures 5-7:** Cartilage cells.
  - **Figure 8:** Cartilage cells from *Rana esculenta* (frog).
  - **Figure 9:** Cranial cartilage cells from *Pelobates fuscus* (toad).
  - **Figures 10-12:** Various views of fetal pigâ€™s crystalline lens cells with nuclei and possibly nucleoli.
  - **Figure 13:** Lens of a pike.

These drawings demonstrate the varied appearance of cells across tissues and underline the universal presence of the nucleus.
