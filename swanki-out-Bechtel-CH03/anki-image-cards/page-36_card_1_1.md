The pathway begins with glucose (C6H12O6) forming two molecules of methylglyoxal (C3H4O2) and water (H2O). Methylglyoxal then produces two molecules of pyruvic acid (C3H4O3) and two molecules of alcohol (C2H5OH). Each pyruvic acid is subsequently decarboxylated to yield two molecules of acetaldehyde (C2H4O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The cycle feeds back as acetaldehyde can react again with methylglyoxal.

## What intermediates were Neuberg and Kerb particularly interested in proving to be part of the fermentation pathway?

Neuberg and Kerb's research was particularly focused on proving that methylglyoxal (C3H4O2) was a true intermediate in the fermentation pathway.
