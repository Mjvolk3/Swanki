A typical phospholipid molecule has the following structure and functional properties:
- **Hydrophilic Head**: Composed primarily of a phosphate group, this part is attracted to water.
- **Hydrophobic Tail**: Comprised of long fatty acid chains, this part repels water.
- **Function in Cell Membranes**: Phospholipids arrange themselves into a bilayer in cell membranes, with hydrophilic heads facing the aqueous environments inside and outside the cell, and hydrophobic tails facing inward, away from water. This arrangement helps in regulating the movement of substances in and out of the cell.

## Card 2

What terms did Dutrochet use to describe the selective admission and excretion processes through cell membranes, and how were these processes explained by other scientists later?

Dutrochet (1826; 1828) used the term **endosmosis** to describe the selective admission of nutrients and water into the cell and **exosmosis** to explain the excretion of waste. Later, Carl Wilhelm von NÃ¤geli and Carl Cramer (1855) described the broader process of osmosis in plant cells.
