Harden and Young's conceptualization of fermentation involves the following steps:
1. Two molecules of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) react with two phosphate molecules (R₂HPO₄).
2. The reaction yields two molecules of carbon dioxide (CO₂), two molecules of water (H₂O), one molecule of hexosediphosphate (C₆H₁₀O₄(PO₄R₂)₂), and two molecules of ethanol (C₂H₅OH).
3. Hexosediphosphate slowly breaks down, releasing two water molecules (H₂O) and regenerating the phosphate groups.
4. The regenerated phosphates participate in subsequent reactions with additional glucose molecules, illustrating a cyclic pathway in fermentation where phosphates are reused.

## What is the significance of the cyclic nature depicted in the fermentation pathway by Harden and Young?

The cyclic nature depicted in the fermentation pathway suggests that phosphates are continuously regenerated and reused within the pathway. This recycling ensures the intermediates like hexosediphosphate do not accumulate, thereby maintaining an efficient process where the addition of phosphate consistently stimulates fermentation without depleting phosphate resources.
