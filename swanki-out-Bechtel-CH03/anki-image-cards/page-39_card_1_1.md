The diagram represents the glycolysis process as described by Embden. It showcases how fructose diphosphate is split into two three-carbon molecules: dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. From there, dihydroxyacetone phosphate can be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. These molecules enter a series of reactions leading to the formation of glycerophosphoric acid, phosphoglyceric acid, and ultimately pyruvic acid. This diagram highlights the role of phosphorylated intermediates and the transfer of high-energy phosphate groups during glycolysis in muscle cells.

## Explain the fate of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate in Embden's glycolysis pathway.

In Embden's glycolysis pathway, dihydroxyacetone phosphate can be converted into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate undergoes oxidation to form phosphoglyceric acid. This product then surrenders its phosphate group, eventually leading to the production of pyruvic acid. Pyruvic acid can be further reduced to lactic acid or release a phosphate group to form inorganic phosphate.
