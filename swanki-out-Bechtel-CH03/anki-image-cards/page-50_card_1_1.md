Cellular respiration in the early 1940s was understood to involve three key stages:

1. **Glycolysis**:
   - Conversion of glucose into two molecules of pyruvic acid.
   - Small amounts of ATP are generated.

2. **Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle)**:
   - Further breakdown of glycolysis products into carbon dioxide.
   - Energy-rich hydrogen atoms are captured.

3. **Respiratory Chain (Electron Transport Chain)**:
   - Electrons from harvested hydrogen atoms pass through cytochromes \(a, b, c, a_3\) to generate water and ATP.
   - Question marks indicate unknown steps.

The question marks in the diagram signify points in the respiratory chain where researchers of the early 1940s realized there were additional, unknown steps in the process that they did not yet understand.
