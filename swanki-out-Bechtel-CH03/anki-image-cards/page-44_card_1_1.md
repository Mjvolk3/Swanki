Describe Battelli and Stern's model for the metabolism of succinic acid to malic acid.

%

In Battelli and Stern's model (1907-14), succinic acid undergoes oxidation with the direct addition of activated oxygen to the substrate, facilitated by an enzyme they called "succinoxydone," resulting in the formation of malic acid.

Contrast the models of Battelli and Stern (1907-14) and Thunberg (1916) in the context of the metabolism of succinic acid to malic acid.

%

Battelli and Stern's model involves the direct oxidation of succinic acid by adding oxygen, producing malic acid. In contrast, Thunberg's model incorporates additional steps, including the formation of fumaric acid as an intermediate and the involvement of coupled redox reactions, where succinic acid is first oxidized to fumaric acid, which then hydrates to form malic acid.
