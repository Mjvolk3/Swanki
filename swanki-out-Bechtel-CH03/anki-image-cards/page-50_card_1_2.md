What are the primary stages of cellular respiration as depicted in Figure 3.15, and what is their main function?

%

1. **Glycolysis**: Converts one glucose molecule into two pyruvic acids, generating small amounts of ATP.
2. **Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs cycle)**: Breaks down glycolysis products into carbon dioxide, capturing energy-rich hydrogen atoms.
3. **Respiratory Chain (electron transport chain)**: Electrons from hydrogen atoms pass through a series of compounds (cytochromes a, b, c, a3) to produce water (Hâ‚‚O) and ATP.

What do the question marks in the diagram of Figure 3.15 signify?

%

The question marks in the diagram indicate steps in the respiratory chain where researchers in the early 1940s realized there were additional processes that had not yet been understood.
