organelle before Golgi. It was Golgi, however, who devised a method that put the organelle in sharp contrast with other cellular components and permitted him and his students to demonstrate it as a consistent structural component in a wide variety of tissue cell types. It was also Golgi who recognized not only some of the details of its structure but also that it is variable in character and position. (1975, p. 3)

Shortly after Golgi's first publication, Emil Holmgren (1902) identified a set of clear canals within the cytoplasm that remained uncolored when the rest of the cytoplasm was stained. Holmgren construed these canals as formed by cytoplasmic processes penetrating into a cell from its neighbors and suggested that they might serve a nutritive function. He called them trophospongium and claimed they were the same as Golgi's reticular nets although they were located near the external membrane of the cell.

Initially Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal \((1907 ; 1908)\) accepted the link between Golgi's reticular structure and Holmgren's canals and referred to them as the Golgi-Holmgren canals. Later he revised this assessment (Cajal, 1914)
