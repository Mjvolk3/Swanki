## Describe the main challenge in early cell biology and the role of technical advances in overcoming it.

The main challenge in early cell biology was the inability to explore the area between the resolving power of the light microscope and the applicability of chemical techniques. Technical advances enabled visual examination down to the macromolecular level and chemical separation and analysis up to the microscopic level, making this region accessible for study.

## What historical period marked the earnest beginning of identifying cell mechanisms and what tools were deemed necessary for this investigation?

The project of identifying cell mechanisms began in earnest after 1940. This investigation required structural tools more powerful than those used in cytology, functional tools built on existing biochemical techniques, and new techniques that integrated both structural and functional tools.

## Explain the limitations faced by researchers before the technical advances in cell biology.

Before technical advances, researchers could not meaningfully examine organelles with the light microscope because they were too small, and biochemists could only analyze much larger reacting molecules in homogenates from broken cells. This created a gap in understanding the crucial cellular operations occurring in organelles.

## Define protoplasm as described by von Mohl and its significance.

Von Mohl described protoplasm in 1846 as "an opaque, viscid fluid, having granules intermingled in it." Protoplasm was significant because it was considered a universal feature of cells and the material for a new cell nucleus, which prompts cell division.

- #biology, #cell-biology.protoplasm

## Discuss Huxley's three-point unity among living things as described in the passage.

Huxley's three-point unity among living things included the following:
1. All exhibit the power of contractility.
2. All are composed of cells as defined by Max Schultze.
3. All are made of protoplasm composed of proteins containing carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.

- #biology, #cell-biology.huxley

## Explain the term 'sarcode' and its relationship to protoplasm according to the passage.

The term 'sarcode,' introduced by Dujardin in 1835, refers to a viscid, slimy fluid found in animal tissues. Remak later recognized the similarity between plant protoplasm and animal sarcode and used the term protoplasm for both, which was cemented by Schultze's work.

- #biology, #cell-biology.sarcode

## Describe the importance of osmic acid in cell fixation and its potential drawbacks.

Osmic acid was discovered to be a significant fixative in cell studies because it preserved fine cellular details, but it raised concerns about whether it revealed existing structures or generated artifacts.

## What was the role of carmine red and who discovered its selective staining properties?

Carmine red, used by Alfonso Corti and Joseph von Gerlach, was the first stain that selectively colored different cell components, such as the cell nucleus, leading to clearer images.

- #biology, #cell-stains, #microscopy

## Explain the contributions of aniline dyes to cell staining and their origin.

Aniline dyes, discovered by William Perkin, were significant because they stained different cell structures not affected by carmine or hematoxylin, facilitating the coloring of different cell structures in various colors.

- #biology, #cell-stains, #microscopy

## Discuss the debate on the role of the nucleus in cell division and Reichert's contention.

In the mid-19th century, there was considerable debate about the nucleus's role in cell division. Karl Bogislaus Reichert contended that the nucleus disappeared when cells divided and that new nuclei were created in daughter cells.

- #biology, #cell-division, #microscopy

## What significant observation did Remak make about nuclear division in 1852 that contrasted with the behavior of cell membranes?

In 1852, Remak observed that the nucleus divided prior to cell division, but he noted that "Observations on the mechanisms of nuclear division are by no means so extensive as those on the behavior of the cell membranes" (translated by Harris, 1999, p. 139). 

This highlighted an early recognition of the nucleus's role in cell division, despite it being less understood compared to cell membrane behavior.

- #cell-biology, #historical-findings

## What did Wilhelm Hofmeister observe in 1849 about the nuclear membrane and the structures inside the nucleus during cell division?

Wilhelm Hofmeister observed that the nuclear membrane dissolved before the cell divided. He noted that when cells were stained with iodine, discrete lumps, presumably chromosomes, could be seen. Hofmeister proposed these were protein coagulates, and he reported that a granular mucilage formed around these lumps and divided into two, with a membrane forming around each as the cell divided.

- #cell-biology, #microscopy.observations

## What technological advancements in the 1870s and 1880s allowed for significant progress in research on nuclear processes in cell division?

The availability of fixatives, stains, and apochromatic lenses in the 1870s and 1880s enabled significant advancements in research on nuclear processes in cell division. These tools allowed scientists to better observe and characterize the structures and dynamics involved in nuclear division, such as the structures labeled as chromatin by Flemming and the characterization of spindles by Edouard van Beneden.

- #cell-biology, #technological-advancements

## How did Walther Flemming's work in 1878-1879 contribute to the understanding of nuclear division and what new terms did he introduce?

Walther Flemming developed new fixatives, such as a mixture of chromic, osmic, and glacial acetic acids, known as Flemming's solution, to better reveal details of nuclear division. He observed that chromatin (chromosomes) responded to these stains, contrasting with unstained structures he labeled as achromatin. Flemming noted that the rods (chromosomes) split lengthwise and proposed that one half went to each daughter cell. To describe the complex sequence of events, he introduced the terms "indirect nuclear division" and "Karyomitose."

- #cell-biology, #terminology.nuclear-division

## What was the major success in describing mechanisms of cell life in the nineteenth century?

The major success in describing mechanisms of cell life in the nineteenth century was the research on mitosis and meiosis. Researchers identified the continuity of chromosomes from parents to offspring and the stages in the overall operation of splitting cells. For instance, Strasburger (1884) showed that offspring chromosomes originate half from each parent, and Flemming (1887) described chromosome reduction in sperm production. 

- #biology, #cell-division

## Explain Van Beneden's discovery related to chromosomal reduction during fertilization.

Van Beneden discovered that prior to fertilization, the chromosomes in both the egg and sperm nuclei were reduced in half through the process of meiosis. This reduction ensures that a full complement of chromosomes only reappears after fertilization of the egg. He demonstrated this using pronuclei in the nematode Ascaris maglocephala, in which he observed only two anses chromatiques instead of the typical four prior to fertilization.

## Describe how August Weisman contributed to the understanding of inheritance and the role of cell division.

August Weisman highlighted that the procedures of cell division ensure that daughter cells receive a complete set of hereditary material, drawing half from each parent. This insight set the stage for linking cell division to inheritance mechanisms, notably connecting to Mendel's work on dominant and recessive traits. Across cell generations, preservation and proper segregation of genes, known as Mendelian factors, during meiosis explain inheritance patterns.

- #biology, #genetics

## What is the relationship between Mendel's factors and chromosomes as established in the early 20th century?

Mendel's factors, rechristened genes, were linked to chromosomes. Researchers of the Morgan school developed the relationship further, discovering phenomena such as the crossing over of chromosomes during meiosis, which explained gene recombination. This work laid the foundation for modern genetics, illustrating that genes located on chromosomes control hereditary traits and ensuring that germ cells receive one of each pair of Mendel's factors.

- #genetics, #chromosomes

## What phenomenon was key evidence pointing to the existence of cell membranes?

Osmosis was a key type of evidence pointing to the existence of cell membranes. Osmosis is the movement of water in and out of cells until the substances dissolved in it are equally distributed on both sides of the membrane.

## Explain the historical significance of the plasma membrane in the context of different cell organelles.

The plasma membrane surrounds the cell and plays a crucial role in organizing other parts and functions of the cell. This includes enclosing cell organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus. These organelles and their functions were subjects of significant scientific inquiry in the early twentieth century, particularly with advancements in microscopy techniques.

## Describe the contribution of William Hewson to the understanding of cell membranes.

William Hewson, a late eighteenth-century scientist, argued for the presence of an envelope surrounding red blood cells by showing their ability to shrink or swell. Although his research was not widely known in the nineteenth century, it laid foundational concepts that later contributed to the understanding of cell membranes.

## Discuss the advancements in light microscopy and their impact on cell biology in the early twentieth century.

The early twentieth century witnessed significant advancements in light microscopy, including the ultraviolet microscope and the phase contrast microscope. These advancements allowed cytologists to better understand cell structures and functions, although they were often limited by the tools available. These improvements paved the way for more detailed exploration of organelles like mitochondria, the ergastoplasm, and the Golgi apparatus in later decades.

## Discuss the process of endosmosis as characterized by Dutrochet in the context of cellular exchange.

Endosmosis is the process where nutrients and inflow of water are selectively admitted into the cell. This concept was first termed by Dutrochet (1826; 1828), signifying the unit of physiological exchange that selectively allows entrance to nutrients and water.

$$\text{Endosmosis: Inflow of water and nutrients}$$

- #biology.cell-physiology, #physiology.osmosis

## Describe how the experiments by Wilhelm Pfeffer in 1887 contributed to our understanding of cell membranes.

Wilhelm Pfeffer proposed in 1887 that cells are surrounded by semipermeable membranes. This idea was influenced by previous works using artificial semipermeable membranes in osmometers constructed by Moritz Traube.

## Overton (1895; 1896; 1899) found an important characteristic about substances crossing cell membranes. What was the finding and why is it significant?

Charles Ernst Overton discovered that fat-soluble substances pass through cell membranes more easily than water-soluble substances. This finding indicated that cell membranes have a lipid nature, thus allowing these substances to permeate effectively.

$$\text{Fat-soluble substances: More permeable through cell membranes}$$

- #biology.cell-physiology, #biochemistry.membranes

## Explain the difference between endosmosis and exosmosis as described by Dutrochet. Include specific details about each process.

Endosmosis is the process of selectively admitting nutrients and water into the cell, whereas exosmosis is the diffusion of waste out of the cell. These processes were named by Dutrochet to describe the physiological exchanges occurring in cells.

$$\text{Endosmosis: Inflow of water and nutrients}$$

%

A typical phospholipid molecule consists of a hydrophilic (water-attracting) head and a hydrophobic (water-repelling) tail. The hydrophilic head includes a phosphate group and other components that interact with water, while the hydrophobic tail is made up of long fatty acid chains that repel water. This structural arrangement is essential for forming cell membranes, where phospholipids align into a bilayer with hydrophilic heads outward and hydrophobic tails inward, creating a selective barrier for substance movement.

- cell-biology.phospholipids, #chemistry.molecules, #biological-membranes 

## Who characterized the physiological exchange units in phospholipids, and what terms did they use for inflow and outflow processes?

%

Dutrochet (1826; 1828) characterized the physiological exchange units in phospholipids, describing them as selectively admitting nutrients along with water inflow (endosmosis) and excreting waste with diffusion outflow (exosmosis). Carl Wilhelm von Nägeli and Carl Cramer (1855) described osmosis in plant cells.

%

A typical phospholipid molecule has the following structure and functional properties:
- **Hydrophilic Head**: Composed primarily of a phosphate group, this part is attracted to water.
- **Hydrophobic Tail**: Comprised of long fatty acid chains, this part repels water.
- **Function in Cell Membranes**: Phospholipids arrange themselves into a bilayer in cell membranes, with hydrophilic heads facing the aqueous environments inside and outside the cell, and hydrophobic tails facing inward, away from water. This arrangement helps in regulating the movement of substances in and out of the cell.

- #biology, #cell-biology.phospholipids, #biochemistry

## Card 2

What terms did Dutrochet use to describe the selective admission and excretion processes through cell membranes, and how were these processes explained by other scientists later?

%

Dutrochet (1826; 1828) used the term **endosmosis** to describe the selective admission of nutrients and water into the cell and **exosmosis** to explain the excretion of waste. Later, Carl Wilhelm von Nägeli and Carl Cramer (1855) described the broader process of osmosis in plant cells.

## Explain the Danielli-Davson "sandwich" model of membrane structure including the role of proteins as shown in Figure 3.4.

The Danielli-Davson "sandwich" model of membrane structure posits that membranes are composed of a lipid bilayer with phospholipids arranged such that their hydrophobic tails face inward and their hydrophilic heads face outward. In addition to this bilayer, Danielli and Davson proposed that there are protein layers on the outer surfaces (represented by jagged lines in Figure 3.4), which help to stabilize the membrane and possibly play a role in its permeability.

- #biochemistry, #cell-biology.membrane-structure, #historical-models

## What critical observation did Overton make about membrane composition?

Overton observed that substances soluble in fats could pass through membranes more easily than water-soluble ones. This led him to infer that membranes are partly composed of lipids. Overton's conclusion was crucial in establishing lipids as a universal feature of cell membranes.

- #biochemistry, #cell-biology.membrane-structure, #historical-research

## What conclusion did Gorter and Grendel reach based on their lipid extraction from red blood cells, and how does it relate to membrane structure?

Gorter and Grendel concluded that there was just enough lipid in red blood cells to cover the cell with a layer two molecules thick. They proposed that each phospholipid molecule has a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail, and that these molecules form a bilayer with hydrophobic tails facing inward and hydrophilic heads facing outward. This arrangement makes the outside of the membrane hydrophilic and the inside hydrophobic.

## How did the findings of Danielli and Davson build on the work of Gorter and Grendel, and what did they add to the model of membrane structure?

Danielli and Davson built on Gorter and Grendel's work by adding that the lipid bilayer is flanked by protein layers. This "sandwich" model suggested that proteins cover the lipid bilayer, adding structural stability and possibly influencing membrane permeability. This model was critical in advancing the understanding of membrane structure and function.

The Danielli-Davson "sandwich" model proposed that the cell membrane consists of a phospholipid bilayer with hydrophilic (water-attracting) heads facing outward and hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails facing inward. Additionally, the model included protein layers coating the outer surfaces of the bilayer, depicted as jagged lines in the diagram. These proteins were not embedded within the membrane but rather on its exterior surfaces.

The Danielli-Davson "sandwich" model of membrane structure describes a lipid bilayer where protein layers are present on the outer surfaces. The key components include:

- **Proteins:** Represented by jagged lines at the top and bottom, indicating protein layers on the exterior of the bilayer.
- **Hydrophilic Heads:** Circular heads with a zigzag pattern beneath the protein layers, representing the water-attracting parts of phospholipid molecules.
- **Hydrophobic Tails:** Straight lines extending downward from the hydrophilic heads, representing the water-repelling parts of the phospholipid molecules.

In this model, proteins are not embedded within the membrane but coat its surfaces, differentiating it from more modern interpretations of membrane structure.

## How did Richard Altmann observe filaments in the cytoplasm of cell types around 1890?

Altmann used improved fixation techniques such as a solution of potassium dichromate and osmium tetroxide. When combined with an acid-fuchsin stain differentiated by picric acid and delicate heating, this allowed him to observe filaments in the cytoplasm of nearly all cell types.

- #cell-biology, #experimental-techniques, #mitochondria-history

## Describe the specific metabolic processes that Altmann attributed to granules and his view on the structure of protoplasm. 

Altmann attributed basic metabolic processes, specifically fat metabolism and secretion, to these granules. He opposed the view that protoplasm has a uniform structure, instead maintaining that granules were the basic living unit.

- #cell-biology, #metabolism, #theory-of-protoplasm

## What was the central idea behind Altmann's "bioblasts," and how did it differ from modern mitochondrial understanding?

Altmann coined the term "bioblasts" to describe granules, which he considered equivalent to independently existing microorganisms. This differs from modern mitochondrial understanding, as mitochondria are now recognized as membrane-bound organelles involved in cellular respiration and energy production.

- #cell-biology, #mitochondria, #historical-concepts

## What was the significance of the dictum "omne granulum e granulo," and how did it align with Virchow's dictum?

Altmann's dictum "omne granulum e granulo" ("every granule from another granule") aimed to extend Virchow's dictum "omnis cellula e cellula" ("every cell from another cell"). This reflected his belief that granules (bioblasts) were fundamental living units, similar to how cells were viewed as the basic unit of life.

- #cell-biology, #historical-theories, #altmanns-dictum

## Discuss William Bate Hardy's criticism of Altmann's reliance on fixatives like osmic acid.

Hardy criticized Altmann's use of fixatives, stating that these reagents are coagulants of organic colloids and produce precipitates with varying structures depending on the reagent used.

## Explain Carl Benda's contribution to the study of Altmann's structures and the term "mitochondria."

Carl Benda used crystal violet to stain Altmann's structures and named them mitochondria. He observed these structures in both fixed and living cells, reducing the plausibility that they were artifacts of fixation.

- #cell-biology #mitochondria #Carl-Benda

## How did Michaelis's experiment with Janus Green dye contribute to understanding the function of mitochondria?

Michaelis showed that Janus Green dye turns blue-green in the presence of mitochondria in living cells, suggesting that mitochondria have the capacity to oxidize substrates, which was a clue to their role in cellular respiration.

## What observations did Cowdry (1924) make about the shape of mitochondria in relation to cell injury?

Cowdry (1924) observed that the shape of mitochondria changes upon cell injury, serving as a delicate criterion for assessing various types of cell damage.

- #cell-biology, #mitochondria, #cell-injury

## What did the reactions of mitochondria with various reagents, such as acetic acid, alcohol, ether, and chloroform, suggest about their composition?

The solubility of mitochondria in acetic acid, alcohol, ether, and chloroform suggested a phospholipid constitution. Additionally, the failure to stain with Sudan III and Millon's reagent indicated that mitochondria did not contain significant amounts of fat or protein.

- #cell-biology, #mitochondria, #biochemical-analysis

## What critical role did Kingsbury (1913) propose that mitochondria play, based on the fixatives used for their visualization?

Kingsbury (1913) proposed that mitochondria play a critical role in respiration, noting that the best visualization fixatives (osmic acid, potassium dichromate, and formalin) depend on reducing substances.

- #cell-biology, #mitochondria, #respiration

## Explain the relationship between the amount of mitochondria and cellular activity according to Cowdry (1924).

Cowdry (1924) noted a positive correlation between the amount of mitochondria in a cell and its level of activity (e.g., division, secretion). He also observed a negative correlation between the amount of mitochondria and the amount of fat in the cell, suggesting that decreased oxidation favors fat deposition and increased oxidation hastens fat elimination.

## What was ergastoplasm, according to Charles Garnier's research, and how was it identified?

Ergastoplasm, according to Charles Garnier's research, was identified as a fibrillar material or rod-like structure in gland cells. Garnier used various stains like safranin, gentian violet, and toluidine blue to explore its presence and linked its intensity to the stage of secretion in gland cells.

## What experimental evidence did Regaud provide to support the existence of the ergastoplasm?

Regaud showed that when he added acetic acid to his fixative, the ergastoplasm appeared as Garnier reported, but mitochondria were not visible. If he left out the acetic acid, mitochondria appeared, but no ergastoplasm.

- #cell-biology, #fixation.ergastoplasm

## Who proposed that the ergastoplasm was simply poorly fixed mitochondria, and how does this relate to other contemporaneous views?

Christian Champy (1911) proposed that the ergastoplasm was simply poorly fixed mitochondria. This view was in opposition to Morelle (1927), who denied that the ergastoplasm had a fibrillar structure and proposed that it was simply modified ground cytoplasm.

## Description of the Golgi Apparatus by Cowdry in 1924

What substances help in identifying the Golgi apparatus under a microscope, as mentioned by Cowdry in 1924?

The Golgi apparatus can be identified by its reactions to certain substances:
- Soluble in alcohol.
- Becomes blackened after prolonged treatment with osmic acid.
- Shows a marked affinity for silver salts after appropriate preliminary fixation.
- Occasionally stained with resorcin-fuchsin, iron hematoxylin, and other dyes.

- #cell-biology, #historical-scientific-progress

## Structural Variability Across Cell Types

How did Cowdry in 1924 describe the variability of the Golgi apparatus across different cell types?

Cowdry (1924) reported that the Golgi apparatus has a relatively constant appearance within a particular cell type but varies significantly across different cell types. This variability in morphology is closely related to the differences in cellular organization and function.

## Cajal's Contribution to Golgi Apparatus Research

What correlation did Cajal note in his research on the Golgi apparatus, and what did he observe in intestinal goblet cells?

Cajal noted a correlation between the Golgi apparatus's presence in a cell and its secretory activity. He observed tiny droplets of mucus in the Golgi region of intestinal goblet cells that secrete mucus over the lining of the intestine.

- #cell-biology, #golgi-apparatus.cell-function.

## Explain the significance of the Golgi apparatus in cell secretion as proposed by Robert Bowen.

Bowen defended the idea that the Golgi apparatus centralizes in cell secretion, noting that granules for secretion appear in the Golgi and then separate from it in varied ways across different tissue types.

- #cell-biology.cell-function, #cell-biology.cell-secretion

## Describe the main argument by Strangeways and Canti regarding the Golgi apparatus and the counterargument presented by Richardson.

Strangeways and Canti argued that the Golgi apparatus was an artifact of staining, as they couldn’t observe it in unstained cells. Richardson countered this by finding evidence in cultured cells and proposing that the Golgi apparatus was fragmented in the cells observed by Strangeways and Canti.

- #cell-biology.biological-techniques, #scientific-debate.historic

## State the primary claim made by Maurice Parat about the Golgi apparatus. How did John Baker expand on this claim?

Maurice Parat claimed that the Golgi apparatus observed in cells was an artifact created when fixatives caused cytoplasmic vacuoles to coalesce. John Baker expanded on this by suggesting that the artifact was produced by metal deposition on the vacuole periphery during cell preparation.

- #cell-biology.biological-techniques, #scientific-debate.historic

## Assess the evidence provided by Beams and King regarding the nature of the Golgi apparatus through their experiments.

Beams and King demonstrated the fluid or semifluid character of the Golgi apparatus by using a centrifuge to make it appear to stream through the cytoplasm in guinea pig uterine gland cells. Bourne accepted this as evidence that the Golgi apparatus is a definitive cell organelle.

- #cell-biology.cell-function, #scientific-method.experiments

## What was the primary function attributed to the Golgi apparatus by Kirkman and Severinghaus?

Kirkman and Severinghaus suggested that the Golgi apparatus serves as a condensation membrane for concentrating products into droplets or granules. 

$$
\text{Golgi apparatus} \rightarrow \text{Condensation membrane}
$$

These products, elaborated elsewhere and diffused into the cytoplasm, may include lipoids, yolk, bile constituents, enzymes, hormones, etc.

- #cell-biology, #organelles.golgi-apparatus

## What was Bowen's view on the role of the Golgi apparatus, and how did it contrast with Kirkman and Severinghaus' view?

Bowen argued that the Golgi apparatus was "a great intracellular center of chemical synthesis or enzyme formation."

$$
\text{Golgi apparatus} \rightarrow \text{Chemical synthesis or enzyme formation}
$$

This contrasts with Kirkman and Severinghaus' view that it acts primarily as a condensation membrane rather than a site of synthesis.

- #cell-biology, #organelles.golgi-apparatus

## How did the consensus regarding the Golgi apparatus' function evolve by 1940, and what challenges remained according to De Robertis, Nowinski, and Saez?

By 1940, a consensus was developing that the Golgi apparatus was a true component of the cell, primarily functioning in cell secretion. However, there were still significant challenges, as noted by De Robertis, Nowinski, and Saez:

$$
\text{Golgi apparatus} \rightarrow \text{Relationship with secretion} \text{ (hypothetical)}
$$

They pointed out that the functional significance of the Golgi apparatus in non-secreting cells and nerve cells remained particularly unclear.

## What major issue did Albert Claude and George Palade raise regarding the Golgi apparatus in 1949, and how did their views change over time?

In 1949, Albert Claude and George Palade argued that the Golgi apparatus was an artifact of staining. However, they eventually accepted the existence of the Golgi apparatus, and Palade made significant contributions to determining its function.

$$
\text{Golgi apparatus} \underset{earlier \ view}{\longrightarrow} \text{Artifact of staining}
$$
$$
\text{Golgi apparatus} \underset{later \ view}{\longrightarrow} \text{Accepted structure}
$$

Palade's later work contributed to a deeper understanding of the Golgi apparatus' role within cells.

## What significant contributions did Antoine Lavoisier make to the foundation of biochemistry?

Antoine Lavoisier significantly contributed to charting the path for future biochemistry by determining that carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are constituents of all living organic substances. His work laid the groundwork for analyzing organic substances in terms of these elements.

- #biochemistry, #history.antione-lavoisier

## Which elements did Antoine Lavoisier determine to be constituents of all living organic substances?

Antoine Lavoisier determined that carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) are constituents of all living organic substances.

## What was the primary method cytologists used to determine the function of organelles in the early twentieth century?

Cytologists primarily used the method of correlating the frequency of organelles' occurrence with the activities the cell was performing.

- #cell-biology, #historical-methods.organelle-function

## Describe the role of biochemistry in moving beyond the limited resources of cytologists in the early twentieth century.

During the first half of the twentieth century, biochemistry emerged as a crucial field for understanding cell mechanisms, enabling researchers to move beyond the limitations of purely cytological methods by providing a deeper insight into the chemical processes within cells.

## What is the chemical equation for fermentation as worked out by Thénard and Gay-Lussac in the 19th century?

The chemical equation for fermentation, as formulated by Louis Jacques Thénard and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, is represented as:

$$
\mathrm{C}_{6}\mathrm{H}_{12}\mathrm{O}_{6} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}_{2} + 2 \mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{5}\mathrm{OH}
$$

- #chemistry, #biochemistry.fermentation

## What did Lavoisier and LaPlace conclude about respiration in their research?

Lavoisier and LaPlace concluded that "Respiration is thus a very slow combustion phenomenon, very similar to that of coal." This implies that respiration is fundamentally a combustion process where oxygen is used to convert organic compounds into carbon dioxide and heat. 

Essentially, they compared the heat generated by respiration in animals to the heat of combustion of coal generating the same amount of carbon dioxide. 

- #biochemistry, #respiration.cellular-respiration

## Who introduced the term "catalysis" and what was its initial application in biochemistry?

Jöns Jacob Berzelius introduced the term "catalysis" in 1836. He proposed applying the idea to fermentation, citing substances known as catalysts that facilitated chemical reactions without being consumed by them.

Berzelius also pointed out the similarity between chemical reactions occurring in inorganic nature and those in living organisms, particularly focusing on substances that could promote reactions like fermentation.

- #biochemistry, #chemistry.catalysis

## What was the significance of Payen and Persoz's extraction of the chemical component diastase from germinating grains of malt?

Payen and Persoz's extraction of diastase from germinating grains of malt in 1833 was significant because it isolated the chemical component that facilitated the conversion of starch to sugar. This discovery confirmed that chemical reactions promoted by specific substances, later known as enzymes, were crucial to biological processes such as fermentation.

This discovery was foundational because it demonstrated specific biochemical catalysts that promoted reactions without being consumed, hence showing functional parallels with inorganic catalysts.

- #biochemistry, #enzymology.enzyme-discovery

## What was the significance of Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea in 1828? Include specific details about the substances he used.

Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea from ammonia and cyanic acid in 1828 was significant because it demonstrated that organic compounds could be synthesized from inorganic materials. This challenged the prevailing belief that organic compounds could only be produced by living organisms. 

Written in a letter to Berzelius, Wöhler exclaimed:

"I can make urea without needing a kidney, whether of man or dog."

The chemical reaction he achieved can be represented as:

$$\text{NH}_3 + \text{HNCO} \rightarrow \text{NH}_2\text{CONH}_2$$

where $\text{NH}_3$ is ammonia and $\text{HNCO}$ is cyanic acid.

## What classification of nutrients did William Prout propose in 1827, and how did this inspire Justus Liebig's work in Animal Chemistry?

William Prout classified the nutrients required by animals into three classes: saccharine (carbohydrates), oleaginous (fats), and albuminous (proteins). This classification inspired Justus Liebig's work in Animal Chemistry, where he formulated a scheme for the synthesis and breakdown of these nutrients in animal bodies.

Prout noted the minor differences in chemical composition between the nutrients from plants and the compounds in animal bodies, which Liebig used to hypothesize that animals could incorporate and break down these nutrients as needed for bodily functions.

- #nutrition-science, #animal-chemistry, #william-prout

## Describe Justus Liebig's hypothesis on how animals utilize proteins, carbohydrates, and fats in their bodies as detailed in his work "Animal Chemistry".

Justus Liebig hypothesized the following utilization scheme in animals, as detailed in his work "Animal Chemistry":

- Proteins: Liebig proposed that animals incorporate protein from their diet into their tissues and break down these proteins for muscle work, with waste products excreted.
- Carbohydrates and Fats: He believed animals burn these nutrients to generate heat. When insufficient oxygen was available, carbohydrates and fats were converted to fat and stored.

This hypothesis included the idea of breaking down proteins for muscle work and burning carbohydrates and fats for heat production, contributing to a general scheme of the chemical operations in animals.

- #animal-chemistry, #nutrient-metabolism, #justus-liebig

## Why did Jacob Berzelius criticize Justus Liebig's "Animal Chemistry", despite its dedication to him?

Jacob Berzelius criticized Justus Liebig's "Animal Chemistry" for being overly speculative and not grounded in sufficient experimental evidence. Berzelius referred to it as "physiological chemistry... created at the writing table", implying that Liebig's detailed chemical formulae and hypotheses were more theoretical than empirically validated.

The criticism stemmed from skepticism about the detailed formulae and the synthetic nature of Liebig's chemical processes described in the book.

- #scientific-criticism, #animal-chemistry, #berzelius

## What was Liebig's assumption about animal processes and what did Claude Bernard discover that challenged it?

Liebig assumed that all processes in animals were catabolic, breaking down complex substances into simpler ones without creating anything new. However, Claude Bernard discovered that glycogen was being synthesized in animals, revealing the oversimplification in Liebig's scheme.

- #biochemistry, #metabolism


## What is Berzelius's contribution to the understanding of fermentation according to the text?

Berzelius coined the concept of a catalyst and assumed it would be straightforward to generate a chemical account of fermentation. However, the discovery by Schwann, Cagniard-Latour, and Kützing that yeast were living organisms complicated this view.

- #biochemistry, #fermentation


## According to the card, what was the initial view about chemical accounts of physiological processes and how did Wöhler respond to the findings that challenged this view?

The initial view was that physiological processes could be fully explained by chemical accounts. Wöhler, along with Liebig, responded harshly to findings such as the living nature of yeast by publishing satirical works that ridiculed these new ideas.

- #scientific-history, #physiology


## How did Berzelius's and Liebig's presumptions affect their interpretation of fermentation in the context of physiology?

Berzelius and Liebig presumed that fermentation, like other physiological processes, could be entirely explained by chemistry without considering biological factors. This view was challenged by discoveries that yeast were living organisms, leading to a shift in the understanding of fermentation.

- #historical-context, #science-philosophy

## What is spherical aberration in optics and how does it affect microscopic observations?

Spherical aberration occurs because light rays that pass through a lens at different distances from the optical axis come into focus at different points. This results in a blurred or distorted image. 

In the context of microscopy, spherical aberration can significantly impair the resolution and clarity of the observed specimens, making it challenging to discern fine structural details. This was a major limitation for early microscopists.

- #optics, #microscopy.spherical-aberration, #lens-imperfections

---

## What is chromatic aberration and why was it problematic for early microscopy?

Chromatic aberration results from the fact that different wavelengths of light refract to different degrees when passing through a lens, causing each color to come into focus at different points. This disperses colors and leads to fringes of color around the image, further distorting the observation.

This was problematic for early microscopes because it could create misleading images of biological specimens, compounding the difficulty of accurately identifying and understanding microstructures.

## Describe Robert Hooke's observation and interpretation of cork using his microscope, as detailed in his 1665 book "Micrographia."

Robert Hooke observed that cork was perforated and porous, resembling a honeycomb with small cavities, which he termed "cells." He noted that these cavities were not very deep and consisted of many little boxes separated by continuations of what appeared to be long pores.

This led to the coining of the term "cell" in biology, though it was later realized that the living cells of plants and animals did not quite match the hollow chambers Hooke described.

- #history-of-science, #microscopy.hooke, #biology-cell-discovery

---

## Explain the discrepancy between the term "cell" as used by Robert Hooke and the modern understanding of a biological cell.

Robert Hooke used the term "cell" to describe the small cavities he saw in cork, which appeared as hollow chambers surrounded by walls. The term "cell" was historically a misnomer because modern cells are not simply hollow spaces but complex structures containing various organelles.

E. B. Wilson critiqued the term, noting that the biological cell is far more intricate and not just a hollow chamber, reflecting the advanced understanding of cell structure by the end of the nineteenth century.

- #history-of-science, #biology.cell-discovery, #terminology-evolution

## What was Pasteur's stance on the nature of fermentation according to the paper, and what did it suggest regarding chemical accounts?

Pasteur believed that "Fermentation is correlated to the vital processes of yeast." This stance suggested the futility of providing a purely chemical account of fermentation, as it emphasized the vital, living processes over chemical mechanisms.

- #biology, #fermentation.pasteur

## Describe the key contribution of Wilhelm Kühne in the context of fermentation research as per the text.

Wilhelm Kühne introduced the term "enzyme," derived from the Greek phrase for "in yeast." This term eventually became the general designation for chemical agents responsible for catalyzing reactions, distinguishing them from living organisms that produced chemical changes.

- #biology, #enzymes.history

## What conflict did Lavoisier's research open regarding animal respiration, and which researchers were involved in this debate?

Lavoisier's research initiated a prolonged conflict about whether respiration occurred in the lungs (Lavoisier), blood (Liebig, Bernard), or tissues (Pflüger). Each proposed a different primary site for respiration, reflecting distinct biochemical perspectives.

- #physiology, #respiration.lavoisier

## What was Eduard Pflüger's theory about the mechanism of respiration within tissues?

Eduard Pflüger proposed that the protoplasm of cells within tissues had a complex physical structure due to the polymerization of protein. He theorized that this structure stored energy, which could be released in explosive reactions involving the dissociation of albuminoid molecules into carbonic acid, water, and amide-like substances.

- #physiology, #respiration.pfluger

## Emphasis on Colloidal Chemistry in Early Biochemistry

Colloid chemistry was influential in early physiological studies due to its focus on molecular organization on surfaces, highlighted by Thomas Graham in 1861. 

\section*{The Emergence of Biochemistry in the Twentieth Century}

%
Why did investigators like Thomas Graham propose that protoplasm was composed of colloidal arrays?

%
Thomas Graham proposed that protoplasm was composed of colloidal arrays because colloid chemistry focuses on molecules organized in arrays on surfaces, which was aligned with the complex organization required to explain physiological functions. This influenced researchers at the time to emphasize surface energies and complex molecular phases in their studies.

## Transformation into Biochemistry

During the early twentieth century, biochemical research began to establish its own identity separate from physiological chemistry.

%
What significant changes occurred in the early twentieth century that marked the development of biochemistry as a distinct field?

%
Several significant changes marked the development of biochemistry as a distinct field in the early twentieth century:
1. The term "biochemistry" began to supplant "physiological chemistry."
2. New journals with biochemistry in their titles emerged, such as *Journal of Biological Chemistry* (1905).
3. New professional societies were established, including the section of biological chemistry in the American Chemical Society (1905) and the Biochemical Club in England (1911).

## Otto Warburg and Enzymology

Otto Warburg played a significant role in early biochemistry focusing on colloidal surfaces and later on enzymes, although he referred to enzymes using the older term "ferment."

%
What substance did Otto Warburg identify and what was its significance for cell respiration?

%
Otto Warburg identified a substance he called Atmungsferment, now known as cytochrome oxidase. This enzyme is crucial for cell respiration, as it facilitates the final step in the electron transport chain, enabling ATP synthesis by transferring electrons to oxygen.

## Biochemistry Journals and Societies

The establishment of journals and societies played a crucial role in the dissemination and development of biochemistry as a scientific discipline.

%
List at least three biochemical journals that were established in the early twentieth century.

%
Three biochemical journals established in the early twentieth century are:
1. *Biochemisches Centralblatt* (1902)
2. *Journal of Biological Chemistry* (1905)
3. *Biochemische Zeitschrift* (1906)

These publications contributed significantly to biochemistry by providing dedicated platforms for new research and discoveries.

## What major change marked the transition from physiological chemistry to biochemistry according to Robert Kohler?

Kohler emphasized that the transition from physiological chemistry to biochemistry was marked by the appeal to enzymes rather than protoplasm to explain processes in living organisms.

- #science-history, #biochemistry.transition

## What was Kohler's view on the identification of different enzymes and their role in biochemical processes?

Kohler emphasized the strategy of identifying different enzymes responsible for each reaction. He noted that while simple hydrolytic reactions were known, complex cell reactions like respiration or fermentation were not associated with enzymes until the late 1890s.

- #science-history, #biochemistry.enzyme-activity

## How did Eduard Buchner's 1897 report contribute to the understanding of enzyme activity within cells?

Eduard Buchner's report in 1897 demonstrated that fermentation could occur in a cell-free extract made by grinding yeast cells with sand. This showed that enzymes could operate within cells and not just outside them.

- #biochemistry, #enzyme-activity

## Describe Emil Fischer's lock-and-key model of enzyme action and its significance in the context of enzymes' highly specific nature.

Emil Fischer's lock-and-key model, proposed in 1894, illustrated that the highly specific nature of enzyme action involved the enzyme and substrate fitting together precisely like a key into a lock. This model was significant in revealing why enzymes are so specific in their biochemical reactions.

$$
E + S \rightleftharpoons ES \rightarrow E + P
$$

where $E$ represents the enzyme, $S$ the substrate, and $P$ the product.

## Describe a significant change in biochemistry emphasized by Frederic Holmes related to intermediary metabolism. 

Holmes emphasized that a significant change differentiating biochemistry from its predecessors was the conception of intermediary metabolism, which involves sequences of specific chemical reactions. The goal was to discover each intermediate reaction.

- #biochemistry, #historical-perspective, #metabolism

## What technique did Franz Knoop introduce in 1904 to demonstrate intermediate reactions?

Knoop introduced a technique where animals were fed compounds similar to normal foods but that they could not fully metabolize. This allowed the observation of intermediate products that accumulated in the urine.

- #biochemistry, #experimental-methods, #intermediates

## Why was it a challenge to produce empirical evidence for intermediate reactions in metabolic processes?

Because intermediate products generally did not accumulate and were immediately metabolized, it was difficult to produce empirical evidence for these steps.

- #biochemistry, #metabolism, #empirical-evidence

## Which structural components of organic molecules were identified as relevant to metabolic processes by 1900?

By 1900, organic compounds relevant to metabolic processes could be characterized structurally. Characteristic groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups were identified as being linked at specific sites to the carbon backbones of organic molecules.

- #biochemistry, #organic-chemistry, #structural-identification

## What is the process called that involves the removal of two carbon atoms at a time during fat metabolism?

This process is known as $\beta$-oxidation. 

$\beta$-oxidation is essential in the metabolic pathway where fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria and/or peroxisomes to generate acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle, and NADH and FADH$_2$, which are used in the electron transport chain.

- #biochemistry, #metabolism.beta-oxidation

---

## By 1940, biochemists had developed detailed accounts of which two metabolic processes?

By 1940, biochemists had developed detailed accounts of:

1. The biochemical mechanisms involved in fermentation (glycolysis).
2. Aerobic cellular respiration.

These detailed accounts helped understand the pathways involved in these processes, although the full linkage, especially regarding ATP generation in aerobic respiration, required further investigation involving cell structure.

- #biochemistry, #metabolism.glycolysis.respiration

---

## What major difference exists between fermentation and aerobic respiration in terms of cellular organization?

Fermentation, particularly glycolysis, occurs freely in the cytoplasm and does not depend on cellular organization, whereas aerobic respiration involves complex processes linked with cell structure and membranes. This dependence on cell structure made it difficult to investigate with the tools available by 1940.

This difference highlights why research in fermentation advanced more rapidly than in aerobic respiration where structural components play a critical role in processes such as ATP generation.

- #biochemistry, #metabolism.glycolysis.respiration

## Who first demonstrated cell-free fermentation and how was it proven?

Eduard Buchner first demonstrated cell-free fermentation in 1897. He added sugar to press juice made by adding water to ground yeast and filtering it under pressure. The resulting formation of carbon dioxide indicated fermentation was occurring without living yeast cells, demonstrating that the components inside the cells, termed zymase, were responsible for the fermentation process.

Buchner’s discovery showed that enzymes within the extract could carry out fermentation, overturning the orthodox view that living yeast cells were needed for fermentation.

- #biochemistry, #enzymology.cell-free-fermentation

## The original proposal for the steps in alcoholic fermentation 

Who originally proposed that alcoholic fermentation was a two-step process, and what were the proposed enzymes involved? 

Buchner and Meisenheimer (1904) proposed that alcoholic fermentation is a two-step process. The enzymes involved were zymase, which catalyzes the reaction from glucose to lactic acid, and lactacidase, which catalyzes the reaction from lactic acid to alcohol.

- #biochemistry, #enzymology.alcoholic-fermentation

## The role of lactic acid in muscle action

How did Fletcher and Hopkins in 1907 contribute to the understanding of the role of lactic acid in muscle action? 

Fletcher and Hopkins (1907) showed that the formation of lactic acid during anaerobic muscle contraction was followed by its removal in the aerobic phase. This was pivotal in understanding the biochemical processes associated with muscle action and linked lactic acid formation to both anaerobic and aerobic phases of muscle activity.

- #biochemistry, #metabolism.muscle-action

## Pyruvic acid as an intermediary in fermentation

What was Otto Neubauer’s contribution to understanding the intermediaries in alcoholic fermentation, and how did it impact later research? 

Otto Neubauer identified pyruvic acid as an intermediary in amino acid metabolism and proposed that it also figured in alcoholic fermentation (Neubauer & Fromherz, 1911). This finding was quickly corroborated and was significant because pyruvic acid was found to be decarboxylated to yield acetaldehyde, a crucial step in the fermentation pathway.

$$
\text{Pyruvic acid} \rightarrow \text{Acetaldehyde} + \text{CO}_2 
$$

- #biochemistry, #metabolism.intermediates

## Neuberg’s comprehensive model of alcohol generation from glucose

What comprehensive model did Carl Neuberg develop for generating alcohol from glucose, and what were the key steps involved? 

Carl Neuberg, along with Kerb, in 1914 developed a comprehensive model involving a sequence of reactions to explain the generation of alcohol from glucose. The model proposed that glucose was scissioned into two molecules each of methylglyoxal and water. The methylglyoxal then reacted with acetaldehyde (produced in a previous iteration of the process) and water, thereby generating both pyruvic acid and alcohol. The pyruvic acid was then decarboxylated to produce acetaldehyde.

$$
\text{Glucose} \xrightarrow[\text{scission}]{\text{enzymes}} \text{Methylglyoxal} + \text{Water}
$$
$$
\text{Methylglyoxal} + \text{Acetaldehyde} + \text{Water} \rightarrow \text{Pyruvic Acid} + \text{Alcohol}
$$
$$
\text{Pyruvic Acid} \xrightarrow{\text{decarboxylation}} \text{Acetaldehyde} 
$$

- #biochemistry, #metabolism.comprehensive-model

## Why did Neuberg propose that the intermediate in the pathway of fermentation was an isomer of methylglyoxal, rather than methylglyoxal itself?

Because methylglyoxal failed the critical test of reacting to form alcohol at least as rapidly as glucose, Neuberg proposed that it was an isomer of methylglyoxal that was the true intermediate.

## What important discovery did Arthur Harden make in 1903 regarding fermentation in cell-free extracts?

Arthur Harden established that adding blood serum would produce an $80 \%$ increase in fermentation. 

- #biochemistry, #fermentation.cell-free, #scientific-experiments.discovery

---

## How did phosphate affect fermentation in the experiments conducted by Harden and Young?

Adding phosphate stimulated the fermentation reaction, which would then slow down again when the phosphate was exhausted. They also established that phosphate appeared to be taken up into a hexosediphosphate ester.

$$
\text{Phosphate} + \text{Fermentation} \rightarrow \text{Hexosediphosphate Ester (Hexose-2PO}_4\text{)} \text{+ Hydrolysis Decomposition}
$$

- #biochemistry, #fermentation.phosphate, #scientific-experiments.reactions

## What additional requirement did Harden and Young identify for maintaining fermentation in cell-free extracts?

Harden and Young demonstrated the need for the addition of a "dialyzable substance which is not destroyed by heat" to maintain cell-free fermentation, indicating the presence of another essential substance aside from the heat-sensitive enzyme.

- #biochemistry, #fermentation.maintenance, #scientific-experiments.substrates

## Describe the pathway of fermentation proposed by Neuberg and Kerb.

%

The pathway begins with glucose (C6H12O6) forming two molecules of methylglyoxal (C3H4O2) and water (H2O). Methylglyoxal then produces two molecules of pyruvic acid (C3H4O3) and two molecules of alcohol (C2H5OH). Each pyruvic acid is subsequently decarboxylated to yield two molecules of acetaldehyde (C2H4O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The cycle feeds back as acetaldehyde can react again with methylglyoxal.

The pathway of fermentation proposed by Neuberg and Kerb involves the conversion of glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) into methylglyoxal ($C_3H_4O_2$), which subsequently transforms into pyruvic acid ($C_3H_4O_3$) and alcohol ($C_2H_5OH$). Pyruvic acid is then decarboxylated into acetaldehyde ($C_2H_4O$), generating $CO_2$ in the process. This pathway forms a cycle, where acetaldehyde can react again with methylglyoxal, emphasizing the cyclical nature of the fermentation process. The significance of this pathway lies in its detailed mechanism, prompting extensive research to verify the involvement of intermediates like methylglyoxal.

## How did improvements in microscopy during the late eighteenth century affect biological observations?

In the late eighteenth century, improvements in microscopy, particularly the introduction of achromatic lenses by lens makers such as John Dollond, Joseph Lister, and Giovanni Amici, greatly reduced chromatic aberration and corrected for spherical aberrations. This made microscopes more accurate and reliable, enhancing biological observations.

- #biology, #history-of-science, #optics

## What are chromatic and spherical aberrations, and how do achromatic lenses correct them in microscopy?

Chromatic aberration is a distortion where different wavelengths of light are focused at different distances behind a lens, causing a colored halo around images. Spherical aberration is a distortion where light rays striking the edges of a lens are not focused to the same point as those that strike the center. Achromatic lenses, made by combining different types of glass with varying dispersive properties, correct these distortions by focusing all colors of light to a single point and aligning the focal points for all light rays regardless of where they strike the lens.

The conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl-CoA is significant because:
1. It is a key step linking glycolysis and the citric acid cycle in aerobic respiration.
2. It ensures the complete oxidation of glucose by entering the citric acid cycle where more energy is harvested.
3. The process generates \( \text{NADH} \) from \( \text{NAD}^+ \), which is crucial for the production of ATP via the electron transport chain.

The three alternative metabolic pathways that pyruvic acid can follow are:

1. **Conversion to lactic acid**: Occurs in anaerobic conditions, regenerating 2 NAD⁺ from 2 NADH + 2 H⁺.
2. **Conversion to ethanol and carbon dioxide (CO₂)**: Occurs in anaerobic conditions (such as alcoholic fermentation), regenerating 2 NAD⁺ from 2 NADH + 2 H⁺.
3. **Conversion to acetyl-CoA**: Involves a decarboxylation step in aerobic conditions, releasing CO₂ and generating NADH from NAD⁺, leading to entry into the citric acid cycle.

%

Under aerobic conditions, pyruvic acid is decarboxylated, further oxidized, and combined with coenzyme A (CoA-SH) to produce acetyl-CoA. This acetyl-CoA then enters the citric acid cycle. This process also leads to the generation of NADH from NAD⁺.

## Describe the Wieland schema for oxidation of a compound $\mathrm{RH}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{R}$.

Wieland proposed the following schema for oxidation of a compound $\mathrm{RH}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{R}$ (where $\mathrm{Pd}$ designates palladium, the catalyst, and $\mathrm{Mb}$ designates methylene blue, the dye):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{RH}_{2} + \mathrm{Pd} &\rightarrow \mathrm{R} + \mathrm{PdH}_{2} \\
\mathrm{PdH}_{2} + \mathrm{Mb} &\rightarrow \mathrm{Pd} + \mathrm{MbH}_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

This indicates that $\mathrm{RH}_{2}$ is oxidized by transferring hydrogen to palladium, and subsequently, the hydrogen is transferred to methylene blue.

## How did Otto Heinrich Wieland explain the oxidation of substrates that lacked two removable hydrogen atoms?

When a substrate such as an aldehyde (RCHO) lacked two removable hydrogen atoms, Wieland proposed a two-step process involving hydration (addition of water) followed by oxidation:

$$
\mathrm{RCHO} + \mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{RCH}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{RCOOH} + \mathrm{H}_{2}
$$

Starting with an aldehyde, the substrate is hydrated to form a geminal diol (RCH(OH)2), which is then oxidized, releasing two hydrogen atoms and forming a carboxylic acid (RCOOH).

- #chemistry, #oxidation-hydration, #aldehyde-oxidation

## What did Heinrich Otto Wieland propose about the role of oxygen in biological oxidation?

Wieland suggested that in biological systems, oxygen, when present, serves as the substance that is reduced, forming hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$. An enzyme called catalase quickly converts $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to water:

$$
2 \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{O}_2
$$

Furthermore, he demonstrated that in the absence of oxygen, biological oxidation could still proceed given the presence of a suitable hydrogen acceptor such as methylene blue.

- #biochemistry, #oxidation-reduction, #enzymes

## What is the significance of Wieland's oxidation scheme for biological oxidation?

Wieland's scheme reconceptualized oxidation as dehydrogenation (removal of hydrogen) rather than the addition of oxygen. He illustrated that the oxidation process involves a coupled reaction in which the hydrogen removed from the oxidized substance is accepted by another substance that is reduced. This dual reaction exemplifies that biological oxidation and reduction are tightly linked processes:

$$
\mathrm{Reduction}\colon \text{Substance accepts } \mathrm{H} \\
\mathrm{Oxidation}\colon \text{Substance donates } \mathrm{H}
$$

This coupling was vital to understanding metabolic pathways, such as ethanol and acetaldehyde converting to acetic acid under anaerobic conditions using methylene blue as a hydrogen acceptor.

### Explain the main difference in the conceptualization of oxidation between Battelli and Stern’s and Thunberg’s approach as shown in Figure 3.12.

Battelli and Stern assumed that activated oxygen was added directly to the substrate, succinic acid, resulting in malic acid. Thunberg, on the other hand, recognized fumaric acid as an intermediate and incorporated paired reduction-oxidation reactions, positing specific enzymes as well as the carrier coenzyme FAD rather than molecular oxygen as the immediate hydrogen acceptor.

## Explain the primary oxidation reaction involved in the metabolic pathway described by Thunberg.

The primary oxidation reaction described by Thunberg is the dehydrogenation of succinic acid to fumaric acid. This reaction involves the removal of two hydrogen atoms from succinic acid.

$$
\mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{COOH} \rightarrow \mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{COOH}
$$

In this reaction, succinic acid ($\mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{COOH}$) is oxidized to fumaric acid ($\mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{COOH}$).

- #biochemistry, #metabolic-pathways, #oxidation-reduction

## What role did methylene blue play in Thunberg's experiments?

Methylene blue acted as a hydrogen acceptor in Thunberg's experiments. By removing all oxygen from the reaction environment, Thunberg demonstrated that methylene blue could substitute for molecular oxygen, getting reduced in the process.

When succinic acid was introduced to the oxygen-free environment containing minced muscle tissue and methylene blue, the dye was reduced, as evidenced by its rapid decolorization.

- #biochemistry, #experimental-methods, #hydrogen-acceptors

## Describe the transformation process from fumaric acid to malic acid as detailed in Thunberg's metabolic pathway.

The transformation process from fumaric acid to malic acid involves the hydration of fumaric acid. This process includes the addition of water to fumaric acid, specifically two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom from the water molecule.

$$
\mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{COOH} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}(\mathrm{OH})-\mathrm{COOH}
$$

In this reaction, fumaric acid ($\mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{COOH}$) is converted into malic acid ($\mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}(\mathrm{OH})-\mathrm{COOH}$).

## How did Warburg's interpretation of oxidation reactions differ from Thunberg's?

Warburg construed a reaction with oxygen as the key step in oxidation, focusing on the activation of oxygen as the major catalytic event. He argued that preparing oxygen to combine with substrates was central to the oxidation process.

Warburg's approach differed fundamentally from Thunberg's, who used methylene blue to show that oxidation reactions could occur independently of oxygen reduction. Warburg, instead, maintained that oxygen was essential to the oxidation process.

## What significant discovery about membranes did Ernest Overton make in 1899?

Ernest Overton discovered that the cell membrane, largely composed of fats and lipids, operates as a semipermeable osmotic barrier between a cell and its environment. This indicates that it controls the passage of certain substances in and out of the cell.

- #cell-biology, #membranes.osmotic-barrier

## What effect did alkaline solutions have on sea urchin eggs' respiration according to Warburg (1910)?

Alkaline solutions increased the respiration of sea urchins without altering the alkalinity of the protoplasm. This finding was significant because it pointed to the cell membrane, not the protoplasm, as the site of cellular respiration.

## Describe Warburg’s conclusion regarding the nature of Atmungsferment and its role in biological respiration.

Warburg concluded that Atmungsferment consisted of ferrous iron adsorbed onto the cell membranes. He proposed that this agent was responsible for biological respiration by activating oxygen so that it would combine with hydrogen in the substrate undergoing oxidation. 

$$
\text{Atmungsferment} \approx \text{Fe}^{2+} \text{ adsorbed on cell membranes}
$$

- #biochemistry, #respiration.atmungsferment

## How did Warburg challenge the contemporary view that only soluble enzymes were responsible for significant biological processes?

Warburg opposed the view that soluble enzymes alone were responsible for significant biological processes, asserting instead that these enzymes operated within the context of structured systems. He argued that both cell structure and enzymes were required for the acceleration of energy-producing reactions.

$$
\text{Energy-producing reactions} = \text{Ferment action} + \text{Structure action}
$$

## Describe the debate between Wieland and Warburg regarding the mechanism of cellular respiration.

The debate between Wieland and Warburg centered on the mechanism of cellular respiration. Wieland proposed that dehydrogenases remove hydrogen atoms from substrates, playing a crucial role in oxidation. In contrast, Warburg focused on the activation of oxygen and the role of Atmungsferment in this process. Although both theories initially appeared conflicting, some researchers, like Albert Szent-Györgyi, suggested that both processes might be involved, proposing that activated hydrogen and oxygen work together in cellular oxidation.

- #cellular-respiration, #biochemistry, #historical-perspective

## What did Albert Szent-Györgyi propose about cellular oxidation, and how did it relate to the theories of Wieland and Warburg?

Albert Szent-Györgyi proposed that in cellular oxidation, activated hydrogen is burned by the activated oxygen. He suggested that molecular oxygen is not a hydrogen acceptor; instead, the biological hydrogen acceptor is the oxygen activated in Warburg's system. This proposal indicated that the theories of Wieland and Warburg were not mutually exclusive but represented different parts of the same pathway.

## Explain the idea of "complex localization" as characterized by Bechtel and Richardson in the context of cellular respiration research in the 1920s and 1930s.

Bechtel and Richardson characterized the research shift in cellular respiration during the 1920s and 1930s as a move from "simple localization" to "complex localization." Researchers identified a series of interconnected operations forming a complex mechanism rather than a single, simple pathway. This involved uncovering numerous steps and reactions that link together in a sequence, such as Thunberg's proposal of dehydrogenation chains.

- #cellular-respiration, #biochemistry, #research-evolution

## Describe Thunberg's contribution to the understanding of cellular respiration and his proposal of a sequence of dehydrogenation reactions.

Thunberg proposed the concept of a sequence of dehydrogenation reactions in cellular respiration, where the product of one dehydrogenation reaction is further dehydrogenated or otherwise modified in another reaction. This idea of chain reactions in cellular processes laid the groundwork for understanding the complex series of operations in cellular respiration.

## Explain Thunberg's proposed reaction converting acetic acid into succinic acid.

The reaction Thunberg proposed involves the transformation of two acetic acid molecules ($CH_3COOH$) into succinic acid ($COOH-CH_2-CH_2-COOH$) and hydrogen gas ($H_2$):

$$
2 \mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{COOH} \rightarrow \mathrm{COOH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{COOH} + \mathrm{H}_{2}
$$

Thunberg suggested that two acetate molecules each lose one hydrogen atom, leading to the joining of their carbon chains into one. This reaction forms succinic acid as the product.

## What is the role of four-carbon dicarboxylic acids in Szent-Györgyi's proposed scheme?

Albert Szent-Györgyi proposed that four-carbon dicarboxylic acids perform as intermediate hydrogen carriers rather than steps in the oxidation of carbohydrates:

$$\text{Hydrogendonors} \rightarrow \text{oxaloacetate} \rightarrow \text{malate} \rightarrow \text{fumarate} \rightarrow \text{succinate} \rightarrow \text{cytochrome} \rightarrow \text{oxygen}$$

This pathway suggests that these acids are involved in transporting hydrogen ions rather than directly facilitating carbohydrate catabolism.

## Describe the core of Thunberg’s idea that was incorporated into the citric acid cycle by Hans Krebs and William Johnson.

Fifteen years after Thunberg’s proposal, Hans Krebs and William Johnson incorporated the core idea into the citric acid cycle. The key transformation they adopted involves the conversion of acetic acid into a series of intermediates leading to succinic acid. Krebs and Johnson’s cycle elaborated the detailed sequence of reactions including hydrations, dehydrogenations, and decarboxylations.

The citric acid cycle is now recognized for transforming acetyl-CoA through a series of chemical reactions to produce energy intermediates.

## What is the significance of the reaction pathway starting from succinic acid to acetic acid mentioned in the paper?

The sequential reaction pathway presented in the paper delineates the flow of metabolic intermediates:

$$

The significance of this pathway is that it illustrates a series of conversions central to metabolic processes, such as cellular respiration and the citric acid cycle, highlighting the transformation of substrates through enzymatic actions to produce vital cellular energy.

The diagram illustrates the biochemical process of cellular respiration, integrating the theories of Wieland and Warburg. It depicts a reaction pathway where dehydrogenase enzymes activate hydrogen, enabling its separation from the substrate. Concurrently, Atmungsferment (related to Warburg's theory) activates oxygen, allowing it to combine with hydrogen to form water. The pathway involves succinic acid transforming sequentially into fumaric acid, malic acid, oxaloacetic acid, pyruvic acid, and finally acetic acid.

How are Wieland's and Warburg's theories integrated in the context of cellular respiration as per the schematic in Figure 3.13?

## Describe the transformation from pyruvic acid to citric acid in the Krebs cycle. Mention the intermediates and key enzymes involved.

The transformation from pyruvic acid (pyruvate) to citric acid in the Krebs cycle involves several steps:
1. Pyruvate combines with oxaloacetic acid to form citric acid.
2. This process involves the intermediate acetyl-CoA, an activated form of acetic acid.
3. Key enzymes include pyruvate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase.

$$

## Explain why ordinary acetic acid cannot condense with oxaloacetic acid to create citric acid. What is the form of acetic acid required for this reaction?

Ordinary acetic acid cannot condense with oxaloacetic acid to create citric acid because it lacks the necessary activation. The acetic acid must first be converted to an activated form, specifically a thioester of acetylated coenzyme A, known as acetyl-CoA.

$$
\text{Acetyl-CoA} = \text{CH}_3\text{COS-CoA}

This activated form, acetyl-CoA, can readily participate in the reaction catalyzed by citrate synthase in the Krebs cycle.

## Describe the role of Fritz Lippmann in the research connecting glycolysis to the citric acid cycle. What was his key discovery?

Fritz Lippmann played a pivotal role in connecting glycolysis to the citric acid cycle through his discovery of coenzyme A. His work demonstrated that coenzyme A is critical in the formation of activated acetic acid (acetyl-CoA), which then reacts with oxaloacetic acid to form citric acid.

This discovery bridged a vital gap between glycolysis, which produces pyruvate (converted to acetyl-CoA), and the Krebs cycle.

The described cycle, often referred to as the Krebs cycle or citric acid cycle, plays a critical role in cellular respiration. The cycle begins with the combination of oxaloacetic acid and a three-carbon substance, likely pyruvate, to form citric acid. The citric acid then undergoes a series of transformations to produce succinic acid, releasing molecules like CO2 and H2 along the way. These steps generate intermediates and energy carriers essential for the cell's metabolic processes, notably in ATP production.

## What pivotal role did Theodor Schwann and Matthias Schleiden play in the development of cell theory within nineteenth-century cytology?

Theodor Schwann and Matthias Schleiden were pivotal in developing the cell doctrine, which held that cells are the fundamental structural and functional units of life. This doctrine was foundational for both single-celled organisms and the building blocks of multicelled organisms, despite inaccuracies in their initial accounts.

- #history-of-biology, #cell-theory

## What did Matthias Schleiden identify as a characteristic feature of cells in different tissues, based on Robert Brown's findings?

Matthias Schleiden identified the nucleus, which he referred to as the cytoblast, as the most important region of the cell. He believed that the rest of the cell developed from the nucleus. This notion was based on Robert Brown's finding of the ubiquitous presence of a "single circular areola" in each cell.

- #history-of-biology, #cell-nucleus

## What was Matthias Schleiden's perspective on the nature of plant cells?

Schleiden construed whole animals as individuals but claimed that plants were formed of "fully individualized, independent, separate beings"—the cells. This view was contrasted with his initial limited statement of the cell doctrine for plants.

- #history-of-biology, #plant-biology

## How did earlier findings influence Schleiden's understanding of the nucleus in cells?

Earlier findings, such as those by Felice Fontana and Franz Bauer, had described similar structures in animal tissues before Schleiden identified and named the nucleus as a crucial feature through which he identified cells in different tissues. These structures were seen in epithelial cells and plant stigmas.

### Card 1

## Explain what was understood about glycolysis and the citric acid cycle in the early 1940s.

During the early 1940s, it was understood that glycolysis and the citric acid cycle were crucial steps in cellular respiration. Glycolysis was known to break down glucose into pyruvate, generating a small amount of ATP and NADH in the process. Pyruvate then enters the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle) in the mitochondria where it undergoes further oxidation to produce ATP, NADH, and FADH2. 

Key intermediates in glycolysis:
- Glucose (initial substrate)
- Pyruvate (end product)

Key intermediates in the citric acid cycle:
- Acetyl-CoA (entry molecule)
- Citrate
- α-Ketoglutarate
- Oxaloacetate (regenerates)

Understanding of enzymatic steps and the generation of key molecules like ATP and reducing agents NADH and FADH2 was somewhat incomplete, hence the presence of question marks indicating unknown steps.

## What are the products of one glucose molecule metabolized through glycolysis and the citric acid cycle?

When one glucose molecule is metabolized through glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, the main products are ATP, NADH, FADH2, and CO2.

Glycolysis:
$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 \rightarrow 2 \text{Pyruvate} + 2 \text{NADH} + 2 \text{ATP}$$

Citric Acid Cycle (Per glucose):
$$\text{2 Pyruvate} \rightarrow 2 \text{ATP} + 6 \text{NADH} + 2 \text{FADH}_2 + 4 \text{CO}_2$$

Total yield (Per glucose molecule; combining both pathways):
$$\begin{aligned}
\text{ATP:} & \quad 4 \, (\text{2 from Glycolysis, 2 from Citric Acid Cycle})\\
\text{NADH:} & \quad 10\, (\text{2 from Glycolysis, 6 from Citric Acid Cycle, 2 from Pyruvate Conversion})\\
\text{FADH}_2: & \quad 2\, (\text{from Citric Acid Cycle})\\
\text{CO}_2: & \quad 6\, (\text{2 from Pyruvate Conversion, 4 from Citric Acid Cycle})
\end{aligned}$$

Note: FADH2 and NADH are used as reducing equivalents in oxidative phosphorylation.

## Describe the uncertainty in the cellular respiration pathway as indicated by the question marks in the early 1940s.

In the early 1940s, key uncertainties in the cellular respiration pathway were reflected by question marks. This indicated researchers knew that there were steps or enzymes that facilitated the conversion of substrates in the respiration pathway, but they did not understand the specifics. The exact mechanisms and intermediates involved in steps such as the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and the complete understanding of all enzymatic reactions in the citric acid cycle were not well defined. This lack of understanding revealed gaps that future research would need to address.

Misunderstood steps typically involved:
- Specific enzymes
- Intermediate metabolites
- Mechanistic pathways
- Energy conversion efficiency

Understanding these aspects were necessary for clarifying the entire process of cellular respiration.

### Card 4

## What role did NADH and FADH2 play in cellular respiration?

NADH and FADH2 serve as key reducing equivalents in cellular respiration. They are produced during glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and pyruvate conversion. Their main role is to donate electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC) located in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Step-by-step role:
1. **Glycolysis and Citric Acid Cycle Production:**
    - Glycolysis: Produces 2 NADH.
    - Citric Acid Cycle: Produces 6 NADH and 2 FADH2 per glucose.
    
2. **Electron Donation:**
    $$\text{NADH} \rightarrow \text{NAD}^{+} + \text{H}^{+} + 2e^{-}$$
    $$\text{FADH}_{2} \rightarrow \text{FAD} + 2\text{H}^{+} + 2e^{-}$$

3. **ETC and Proton Gradient:**
    - Electrons pass through the ETC creating a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane.
    
4. **ATP Synthesis:**
    - The proton gradient drives ATP synthesis via ATP synthase.

NADH and FADH2 are crucial for the efficient production of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.

Cellular respiration in the early 1940s was understood to involve three key stages:

1. **Glycolysis**:
   - Conversion of glucose into two molecules of pyruvic acid.
   - Small amounts of ATP are generated.

2. **Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle)**:
   - Further breakdown of glycolysis products into carbon dioxide.
   - Energy-rich hydrogen atoms are captured.

3. **Respiratory Chain (Electron Transport Chain)**:
   - Electrons from harvested hydrogen atoms pass through cytochromes \(a, b, c, a_3\) to generate water and ATP.
   - Question marks indicate unknown steps.

## How many cytochromes did David Keilin identify in his research, and what were they labeled as?

David Keilin identified three different hemochromogens that he labeled cytochrome $a$, $b$, and $c$.

- #biochemistry, #cytochromes.identification, #hemochromogens

## Define the term cytochrome oxidase as used by Keilin and Hartree.

Cytochrome oxidase is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of cytochrome $a_{3}$ to water using molecular oxygen.

- #enzymes, #cytochrome-oxidase.function, #oxidation-process

## Explain the significance of Warburg's Atmungsferment in relation to the electron transport chain.

Warburg's Atmungsferment was identified with cytochrome $a_{3}$ and is part of the electron transport chain, which involves the transfer of pairs of electrons down an energy gradient to molecular oxygen.

- #metabolism, #electron-transport-chain.components, #Warburg's-Atmungsferment


## What are the roles of NAD and NADP in the oxidative chain, according to Warburg's discoveries in the mid-1930s?

NAD (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) are coenzymes that connect oxidative reactions in the citric acid cycle to the electron transport chain.

- #biochemistry, #NAD.and-NADP, #oxidative-chain




## What is the role of FMN and FAD in the electron transport chain according to the historical research by Warburg and Christian?

FMN and FAD play crucial roles in the electron transport chain. FMN is the flavoprotein involved in the pathway from NADH to cytochrome $b$, while FAD is involved in the oxidation of succinic acid, transferring electrons released from this oxidation into the electron transport chain.

- #biochemistry, #electron-transport-chain.flavoproteins 
  
  
## How is the oxidation of succinic acid connected to the electron transport chain?

The oxidation of succinic acid is coupled to the reduction of FAD, which then carries the electrons released from this oxidation into the electron transport chain. This pathway does not produce NADH but directly involves a flavoprotein in the electron transport chain.

- #biochemistry, #electron-transport-chain.succinic-acid 
  
  
## Describe oxidative phosphorylation and how it contrasts with substrate phosphorylation.

Oxidative phosphorylation refers to the synthesis of ATP in conjunction with the oxidative reactions along the respiratory chain, linking the dehydrogenation of the substrate with molecular oxygen. This contrasts with substrate phosphorylation, where the phosphorylation of ADP is directly linked with metabolic intermediates.

- #biochemistry, #metabolism-phosphorylation 
  
  
## What is the significance of coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) in the electron transport chain?

Coenzyme Q, or ubiquinone, plays a crucial role by undergoing reversible oxidation-reduction, interfacing both with FAD and FMN and cytochrome $b$ in the electron transport chain. Its isolation provided significant insights into the oxidation-reduction processes within the chain.

## Describe the major challenge faced by researchers in explaining the linkage between oxidation and phosphorylation in the early 1940s.

Based on the example of fermentation, researchers assumed that intermediate phosphorylated compounds formed along the electron transport chain would transfer a high-energy phosphate bond to ADP. However, such compounds were never found.

## Why was membrane recognition important in the study of oxidative phosphorylation?

Keilin and Hartree (1940) discovered that membranes seemed to be required in any preparation that carried out oxidative phosphorylation. The recognition of the role of membranes was crucial because it was necessary for successful understanding and replication of the biochemical reaction.

## According to Efraim Racker in 1968, what problem was still facing the biochemistry of oxidative phosphorylation?

Efraim Racker noted that the mechanism of energy production in mitochondria defied analysis because a complex chemical pathway in a living organism cannot be fully understood until its intermediate products have been identified and each step's enzymes have been individually resolved as soluble components.

## How did biochemists' main strategy of securing preparations hinder structural study in cytology?

Biochemists' main strategy of securing preparations, homogenation, destroyed any cell structure, making it difficult to link biochemical findings with cytological research.

## Describe two key tools introduced around 1940 that advanced cell structure studies and the associated challenge with these tools.

The two key tools introduced around 1940 were the ultracentrifuge and the electron microscope. The challenge associated with these tools was determining whether the results they produced offered real information about cells or were merely artifacts.

**Tools:**
1. **Ultracentrifuge:** Separates cell components based on density.
2. **Electron microscope:** Provides higher resolution images of cell structures than light microscopes.

## What was the primary similarity that Schwann noted between plant cells and animal tissues?

Schwann noted that the primary similarity between plant cells and animal tissues was the presence of the nucleus. This observation was significant because Schleiden had shown the importance of the nucleus in plant cells. Schwann identified opaque spots in the units of different animal tissues, especially those in an embryological state, and recognized them as nuclei. This led him to conclude that all animal tissues were comprised of cells, despite their varied appearances.

- #biology, #cell-theory.similarity

## Describe Schleiden’s and Schwann’s different accounts of cell formation. 

Schleiden proposed that cells formed within preexisting cells through a process of accretion. The material comprising the nucleus forms first around the nucleolus, and then another layer forms, corresponding to the cytoplasm, around the nucleus.

Schwann, however, adapted this mechanism for animal cells but located the process in the intercellular fluids rather than within existing cells. Schwann referred to this process in animals as exogenous cell formation and in plants as endogenous cell formation.

- #biology, #cell-formation.mechanics

## Why might Schwann have been convinced that cells formed through exogenous processes rather than cell division?

Despite other investigators describing cell division and Schwann being a master of microscopic technique, Schwann was convinced that cells formed through exogenous processes because he sought to provide a mechanistic account of basic structures in living organisms. Schwann's objective was to establish a universal principle of development for all tissues. This mechanistic vision was influenced by Johannes Müller’s group of investigators, who pursued similar objectives.

- #biology, #scientific-methodology.mechanistic-vision

## Explain Schwann’s universal principle of development for the elementary parts of organisms.

Schwann's universal principle of development stated that "The elementary parts of all tissues are formed of cells in an analogous, though very diversified manner." He believed there was one universal principle of development for the elementary parts of organisms, despite their diversity. This principle was the formation of cells, providing a foundational doctrine for cell theory: all living tissues are comprised of cells formed in a consistent manner across different organisms.

Schwann’s microscopic research was seminal because it provided concrete visual evidence of cellular structures in both plants and animals, supporting the universality of the cell theory. Schwann showed that tissues from various species, such as the cartilage of Rana esculenta (frog) and the crystalline lenses of a fetal pig, share a fundamental cellular organization.

## Define Schwann's proposal on cell and crystal formation drawing a parallel between these mechanisms.

Schwann proposed that a mechanism of attraction drew a particular kind of material out of the intercellular fluid, with each layer (the nucleolus, the nucleus, and the cytoplasm) drawing out different substances. He discounted the importance of differences between inorganic crystals and biological cells. What did Schwann say would happen if crystals were formed from the same substances as cells?

%
Schwann posited that if crystals were formed from the same substances as cells, they would probably be subject to the same conditions as cells. This comparison was used to highlight the mechanical nature of cell formation, paralleling it to the known mechanical process of crystal formation, not requiring any vital forces.

## What was the significant enzyme discovered by Schwann in his research on digestion?

Schwann discovered a specific enzyme in his earlier research on digestion. Name this enzyme.

## State Schwann's stance on fermentation and its implications for mechanistic physiology.

In 1837, Schwann presented evidence relating to fermentation. Explain Schwann's view on fermentation and its relationship to mechanistic versus vitalistic physiology.

%
Schwann presented evidence that fermentation was a process requiring living yeast cells. While some mechanists associated such a claim with vitalism, Schwann did not see himself as embracing vitalism. He later introduced fermentation as an example of the metabolic phenomena exhibited in cells, emphasizing that metabolic activities were due to the distinctive chemical constitution of cells, resulting from a mechanical process of cell formation.

## What does Schwann's cell theory propose about growth and cell vitality?

Explain Schwann's assertion about the locus of control for basic life functions in cells and how it relates to cell growth and independent vitality.

%
Schwann's cell theory proposed that the cell is the locus of control for basic life functions like nutrition. He argued that cells grow according to the same laws, implying the cause of growth cannot lie both in the cell and the whole organism. Schwann suggested that all cells possess an independent vitality, meaning the molecular combinations within any single cell enable it to set free the power required for growth.

- #biology, #cell-theory, #organismal-growth

## Explain the controversy between Schwann's and Schleiden's mechanism for cell formation and the observations made by researchers like Dumortier and von Mohl.

Schwann and Schleiden contended that cells formed like crystals, which led to controversy. However, researchers such as Dumortier (1832) and von Mohl (1837) observed cell division in Conferva aurea, providing evidence against Schwann's mechanism.

Barthélemy Dumortier and Hugo von Mohl reported cell division observations, where nucleus division precedes cell division, conflicting with Schwann's account.

- #biology.cell-theory, #scientific-history.cell-division

## What decisive argument did Rudolf Virchow and Robert Remak provide against Schwann's account of cell formation?

Virchow (1858) and Remak (1852; 1855) argued that Schwann's account amounted to spontaneous generation. Instead, Virchow contended that each cell arises from a pre-existing cell, a concept summarized by the phrase "omnis cellula e cellula."

$$\text{omnis cellula e cellula}$$

- #biology.cell-theory, #scientific-history.virchow

## What is the significance of the phrase "omnis cellula e cellula" and who first employed it?

The phrase "omnis cellula e cellula" asserts that all cells arise from pre-existing cells, refuting the idea of spontaneous generation. Although popularized by Rudolf Virchow, François-Vincent Raspail first used it in 1825 as an epigraph.

- #biology.cell-theory, #latin.expressions

## What role did Virchow believe cells played in pathology, and how did he describe his approach?

Virchow viewed the difference between healthy and pathological life as involving organizational properties of whole cells. He characterized his approach to pathology as "cellular pathology."

"Cellular pathology" emphasizes that the cause of nutrition and growth resides in the separate elementary parts—cells.
