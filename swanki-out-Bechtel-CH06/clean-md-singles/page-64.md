Figure 6.15. Electron micrograph of lysosome fraction from rat liver. Arrows indicate the dense bodies taken to be the lysosomes. ER designates microsomal membranes, presumably from the endoplasmic reticulum; the granules within them are much smaller than the dense bodies (lysosomes). MT designates a mitochondrion, which the authors note is not well-preserved. Reproduced from A. B. Novikoff, H. Beaufay, and C. de Duve (1956), Electron microscopy of lysosome-rich fractions from rat liver, Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology, 2 (No. 4, Part 2), 179-84, Figure 1, plate 60, by copyright permission of the Rockefeller University Press.
