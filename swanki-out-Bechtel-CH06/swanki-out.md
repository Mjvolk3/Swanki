### Card 4

What effect did the integration of morphological and biochemical research have on our understanding of cell components in the 1950s?

The integration of morphological and biochemical research in the 1950s stimulated further research in each field and led to a new biochemical and physiological significance for several cell components. This integration also blurred the boundaries between cell morphology and cell physiology and biochemistry, establishing the concept of functional differentiation among cell organelles more firmly.

## What technological advances enabled Palade's discovery of cristae in mitochondria?

Palade's discovery of the cristae structure within mitochondria was facilitated by two significant advancements: the development of a new buffered osmium fixative and the invention of Porter's new microtome, which allowed for very thin slicing of samples.

- #biology.cell, #microscopy.technology, #biological-discovery.history

## What are "cristae" as described by Palade in his 1952 study?

In his 1952 study, Palade described cristae as "a system of parallel, regularly spaced ridges that protrude from the inside surface of the membrane towards the interior" of the mitochondrion. These structures were observed using improved electron microscopy techniques.

- #biology.cell, #mitochondria.structure

## What earlier findings did Palade build upon to substantiate the existence of the mitochondrial membrane?

Palade built upon earlier findings based on electron microscopy of isolated mitochondria and biochemical data regarding the retention of soluble chemical compounds within mitochondria. However, the existence of a mitochondrial membrane was also contested by some other researchers at the time (Harman, 1950b; Huennekens & Green, 1950).

- #biology.cell, #microscopy.evidence, #scientific-method.history

## What methodological approach did Palade use in his comparative investigation that led to the discovery of the cristae?

Palade's methodological approach in his comparative investigation included using a new buffered osmium fixative and Porter's microtome to cut thin slices of cellular material. This meticulous approach allowed him to observe the parallel, regularly spaced ridges now known as cristae inside mitochondria under an electron microscope.

## Describe the unique structure and arrangement of the ridges in mitochondria and their implication in mitochondrial function as discussed by Palade.

Edmund Palade observed that the ridges, or cristae, in mitochondria were "trilaminar" in structure. The central layer is 8 to $10 \mathrm{\mu m}$ thick and is surrounded by two thinner, denser layers. These ridges are arranged "more or less perpendicular to the long axis of the mitochondrion."

Palade suggested that the arrangement of these ridges might serve as a criterion for identifying mitochondria in electron microscopy. This structural decomposition aids in advancing the mechanistic account of mitochondrial function by localizing different biochemical operations within different structural components.

- #cellular-biology, #mitochondria.cristae, #microscopy

## What hypothesis did Palade propose regarding the arrangement of enzymes within the mitochondria and the structure's relevance to mitochondrial function?

Palade hypothesized that the enzymes involved in oxidative processes within mitochondria are maintained in a "definite spatial relationship". He suggested that these enzymes are arranged in linear series or chains within the solid framework of the mitochondrion, particularly along the cristae.

- #cellular-biology, #mitochondria.enzyme-arrangement, #oxidative-processes

## According to Palade, how do the physical properties of mitochondria support the proposed spatial organization of enzymes?

Palade integrated morphological observations with known behaviors of mitochondria, like flexibility, response to osmotic pressure, and results from centrifugation of disintegrated organelles. He proposed that the mitochondrial matrix is fluid, while the membrane and ridges (cristae) represent the solid framework. This solid framework likely hosts the enzyme chains essential for oxidative processes.

- #cellular-biology, #mitochondria.structure-function, #enzyme-localization

## According to the study, what key variegation did Palade and others note in the appearance of cristae between different cell types, and what is the significance of this observation?

Palade and others noted that the appearance of cristae varied between different cell types, yet they appeared to be a regular feature of mitochondria. This finding supports the notion that the structural characteristics of cristae can be leveraged for identifying mitochondria, particularly in electron microscopy, where traditional staining techniques are ineffective.

- #cellular-biology, #mitochondria.cell-variation, #microscopy-identification

## Explain the arguments Palade (1953) used to localize enzyme systems in the cristae of mitochondria.

Palade (1953) offered three primary arguments for localizing the enzyme systems in the cristae of mitochondria. First, he noted that experiments suggested substrate penetration inside the mitochondrion before being acted upon. Second, particles of similar size to individual cristae with most of the succinoxidase systems were isolated from disintegrated mitochondria, suggesting their location. Finally, enzyme systems in the cristae would be less exposed and protected from disruption compared to those in the outer membrane.

## Discuss the contributions of Fritiof Stig Sjöstrand to the field of electron microscopy.

Fritiof Stig Sjöstrand established a significant electron microscopy laboratory at the Karolinska Institute in the 1950s. Early in his career, he began working with an electron microscope and published micrographs of muscle in 1943. Despite challenges like limited access to electron microscopes, he continued his work and ultimately contributed to confirming the organization of the enzymes and coenzymes in mitochondria.

- #electron-microscopy, #cell-biology.sjöstrand


## How did the findings of Palade and Sjöstrand affect the hypothesis of mitochondrial organization in 1957-58 according to Green?

Green (1957-58) credits electron micrographs from Palade and Sjöstrand with providing independent confirmation of the mitochondria's organization. These studies refuted the hypothesis that all the enzymes and coenzymes in the mitochondria were freely diffusible molecular species in the fluid interior, supporting the view of a more organized structure within the mitochondrial membranes.

- #cell-biology, #mitochondria.organization


## What experiment did Lehninger conduct related to mitochondria and enzyme systems as mentioned by Palade (1953)?

Lehninger conducted experiments that indicated substrates need to penetrate inside the mitochondrion before being acted upon, forming one of the arguments used by Palade (1953) to localize enzyme systems in the cristae of mitochondria.

## How did Schmitt's assessment of Sjöstrand's capabilities change between 1950 and 1952, and what were his final evaluations?

In 1950, Schmitt had a mixed impression of Sjöstrand, noting his competence but doubting his potential for making brilliant advances. By 1952, Schmitt's assessment was more positive:
- Sjöstrand was viewed as a sound scientist with the patience necessary for developing complicated techniques required for electron microscopy.

Sjöstrand and Rhodin concluded that mitochondria have an internal structure involving transversally oriented double membranes and a similar outer membrane, suggesting a high degree of organization of these cell organelles.

- #biology, #cell-structure.mitochondria

## How did Sjöstrand describe the inner membranes within mitochondria in his paper with Viggo Hanzon?

Sjöstrand described the inner membranes within mitochondria as densely packed plates mainly oriented perpendicularly to the mitochondrion's long axis. He noted that these membranes also appeared double-edged, with one end in contact with the outer surface membrane, while the other end was mostly free from it.

- #biology, #cell-structure.mitochondria

## What were the two major points of disagreement between Sjöstrand and Palade regarding the structure of mitochondria?

The two major points of disagreement between Sjöstrand and Palade regarding the structure of mitochondria were:

1. **Mitochondrial Membrane Layers**: Sjöstrand maintained that the mitochondrial membrane comprised two layers, whereas Palade viewed it as a single layer.
2. **Cristae Structure**: Sjöstrand rejected Palade's claim that cristae were infoldings of the mitochondrial membrane, arguing instead that there were no indications the inner membranes represented folds of a single-edged surface membrane.

- #biology, #cell-structure.mitochondria-dispute

## According to Palade (1953), how does the inner membrane of the mitochondrion behave in comparison to Sjöstrand's (1956) interpretation?

Palade (1953) proposed that the inner membrane folded into the interior to form cristae, whereas Sjöstrand (1956) argued that the double-layered membranes traversing the mitochondrion were not attached to the (also double-layered) outer membrane.

- #biology.cell-structure, #membrane-theory

## What does Sjöstrand (1956) claim about the structure of double-layered membranes traversing the mitochondrion?

Sjöstrand (1956) claimed that the double-layered membranes traversing the mitochondrion went fully across the mitochondrion and were not attached to the outer membrane.

- #biology.cell-structure, #mitochondria-cristae

## When Palade (1953) accepted Sjöstrand’s claim during a symposium, what new interpretation did he propose regarding the mitochondrial structure?

Palade (1953) proposed that it was only the inner membrane which folded into the interior to form cristae, thus distinguishing it from the outer membrane which does not infold.

- #biology.cell-structure, #membrane-theory.internal-membrane

## What did Sjöstrand mean by interpreting the mitochondrial membrane structure in terms of Danielli and Davson's sandwich model?

Sjöstrand referred to a single double-layered membrane where the outer layers of proteins accounted for the two dark bands, while the inner phospholipid layer accounted for the lighter area between them, based on Danielli and Davson’s sandwich model.

### Card 1

## In the mid-20th century, Sjöstrand and Palade had differing interpretations of mitochondrial structure in electron micrographs. What did Sjöstrand argue was the primary factor leading to high-resolution micrographs and what technique did he propose to maintain this factor?

Sjöstrand maintained that a primary factor in generating high-resolution micrographs was keeping the tissue in as life-like a condition as possible. To achieve this, he proposed injecting fixative directly into living animals as quickly as possible.

- #cell-biology, #microscopy.tissue-preservation, #historical-debate

### Card 2

## According to Sjöstrand, what post-mortem changes could explain the central space observed in Palade's mitochondrial micrographs?

Sjöstrand argued that post-mortem changes, within 15-30 to 45 minutes after death, led to swelling and the fragmentation of the inner mitochondrial membranes, resulting in a central space free from inner membranes. He proposed that these changes might be responsible for the central space described by Palade.

- #cell-biology, #microscopy.tissue-preservation, #historical-debate

### Card 3

## What did Palade observe in his 1952 paper that contributed to the debate with Sjöstrand regarding mitochondrial structure?

In his 1952 paper, Palade commented: "In longitudinal sections that cut close to the mitochondrial membrane, the appearance of the lamellae might suggest that they are septa that traverse the mitochondrion from side to side. Oblique sections, however, indicate that the lamellae are actually ridges or folds protruding from the inside surface of the mitochondrial membrane towards the interior of the organelle without reaching the other side."

### Card 4

## Explain the significance of the term $f_{c}$ in Palade's mitochondrial model. How did it contribute to our understanding of mitochondrial structure?

In Palade's model, $f_{c}$ referred to the central free channel, later called the mitochondrial matrix. This area illustrated the open space within the mitochondria, which was a point of contention between Palade and Sjöstrand. Their differing interpretations of this structure contributed to our evolving understanding of mitochondrial organization and function.

- #cell-biology, #microscopy.mitochondria, #structural-biology

## Describe Sjöstrand's interpretation of mitochondrial structure as presented in the 1954 VIIIth Congress of Cell Biology.

Sjöstrand contended that the inner membranes of mitochondria are not continuous with the outer membrane, and there is no central space extending the length of the mitochondrion. He argued that inner membranes might sometimes form partial septa, allowing communication between compartments. 

- #cell-biology, #mitochondria.structure, #membrane 

## Sjöstrand's view of the central space depicted by Palade was that it is a fixation artefact. Consider the role of hypotonic media in this artefact. Why might Sjöstrand have criticized Palade's method?

Sjöstrand argued that the central space depicted by Palade was a result of the swelling of mitochondria in hypotonic media, specifically buffered osmium tetroxide solution. According to Sjöstrand, Palade's method, which involved a strongly hypotonic solution, led to this artefact.

- #cell-biology, #mitochondria.artifacts, #experimental-methods 

## If Sjöstrand's view on mitochondrial structure is correct, then how might this affect our understanding of the enzyme localization within mitochondria as related to biochemical functions?

Sjöstrand was skeptical about linking mitochondrial structure to specific biochemical functions. He argued that, although the membranes might help in the spatial arrangement of enzymes involved in chain reactions, there isn't enough information to claim where enzyme molecules are precisely located in mitochondria.

- #cell-biology, #mitochondria, #biochemistry.enzyme-localization 

## How might Palade's hypothesis differ from Sjöstrand's in terms of interpreting the structural features and functions of mitochondria? Provide context based on both their assertions.

Palade proposed that the inner structure of mitochondria (including central space) could be linked to the biochemical function, such as the spatial arrangement of enzymes. Sjöstrand countered this by emphasizing that observed structures might be artefacts from preparation methods and that we lack definitive knowledge about enzyme locations within mitochondria.

## Understanding how longitudinal sections reveal mitochondrial structure.
Palade mentioned two possible ways that ridges could project into the interior of the mitochondria. If the ridges project only partway into the interior, what pattern should they display in sections passing lengthwise through the middle of the organelle?

%
Ridges that project only partway into the interior should show free ends partially outlining a central channel or cavity in sections passing lengthwise through the middle of the organelles.

- #biology.cell-mechanisms, #mitochondria.longitudinal-sections

## The inference from serial sections
What did Palade use to argue that cristae are ridges rather than continuous bands, and what feature did he particularly pay attention to?

%
Palade used sequential serial sections to argue that the cristae are ridges rather than continuous bands. He focused on the fact that different ridges disappear as one moves from slice to slice, which supports the idea that the cristae are ridges.

- #biology.cell-mechanisms, #mitochondria.cristae

## The intermembrane space discovery
Palade presented evidence that the cristae are actually infoldings of the inner mitochondrial membrane. He also mentioned a specific space found between the mitochondrial membranes. What is this space called, and what is its significance?

%
The space found between the two mitochondrial membranes is called the intermembrane space. Its significance lies in its approximate width being the same as the central light layer of the cristae, indicating that they communicate freely (p. 207).

- #biology.cell-mechanisms, #mitochondria.intermembrane-space

## Differences in interpretation by Palade and the Swedish group
What was a major difference in the interpretation of mitochondrial structure between Palade and Sjöstrand's group, and how did they name the membranes?

%
A major difference in interpretation was that Sjöstrand's group presented the two membranes at the mitochondrion's periphery as a single unit called the "outer double membrane," whereas Palade recognized them as two separate membranes. Additionally, Sjöstrand's group named the cristae "inner double membranes" and did not recognize them as infoldings but as individual structures with topographical relations to the outer membrane.

## How did the transformation of Rockefeller Institute affect Porter and Palade's laboratory in the middle 1950s?

The transformation turned the Institute into a graduate university. The laboratories began to serve as training centers for graduate students, which included accepting the first batch of graduate students in the laboratory such as Mary Bonneville, Howard Rasmussen, Aaron Shatkin, Lee Peachey, and Peter Satir.

## What was the focus of the intense conflict between Palade and Sjöstrand regarding mitochondrial structure?

The intense conflict centered around the differing interpretations of the mitochondrial inner membrane structure provided by Palade and Sjöstrand. Palade's interpretation, which eventually gained ascendancy, suggested that the inner membrane extended into the interior of the mitochondria and, in some cases, almost touched the other side. On the other hand, Sjöstrand's interpretation suggested that the inner membrane pieces were discontinuous both with the outer membrane and with each other. This disagreement had implications for the biochemical mechanisms attributed to mitochondrial structure, such as Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis.

## How did the interpretations of Palade and Sjöstrand differ in their views on mitochondrial inner membrane structure?

Palade's interpretation proposed that the inner membrane extended into the interior of the mitochondria, in some cases touching or almost touching the other side. Conversely, Sjöstrand's interpretation presented that the inner membrane pieces were discontinuous both with the outer membrane and with each other, resulting in a structure that could not fully support certain biochemical processes, such as the chemiosmotic hypothesis proposed by Mitchell in 1962.

## According to the paper, what did Sjöstrand focus on when using his micrographs at the Third International Conference on Electron Microscopy in 1954?

Sjöstrand focused on making quantitatively precise estimates of membrane sizes based on his micrographs. His approach was to interpret the micrographs purely visually, judging fixation by the criterion of orderliness and seeking greater knowledge of molecular structure through ever-better resolution.

- #biology, #electron-microscopy, #scientific-methods


## How did Palade approach the interpretation of micrographs compared to Sjöstrand, as described by Rasmussen in 1997?

Palade's approach was more integrative, emphasizing the importance of drawing out connections with findings from other techniques such as cell fractionation. Palade was involved in cell fractionation experiments himself and wanted to test micrograph interpretations against biochemical experiments on cell fractions. This contrasted with Sjöstrand's purely visual and quantitative approach to micrograph interpretation.

## Describe the process Green used to fractionate mitochondria and the significance of the different fractions obtained.

Green developed a procedure for large-scale fractionation of mitochondria using beef hearts. The process resulted in a light fraction that lacked the capacity to synthesize ATP when oxidizing succinate and a heavy fraction that retained that capacity. Both fractions could phosphorylate ATP when supplied with other citric acid cycle substrates. By treating the light fraction with $15\%$ alcohol, Green further subdivided it into subfractions, one of which could carry out electron transport but not oxidative phosphorylation.

- #cell-organization, #mitochondria, #biochemistry

## What was the primary goal of applying fractionation to mitochondrial fractions according to the paper?

The primary goal of applying fractionation to mitochondrial fractions was to localize different enzymes in different components of the mitochondrion. This would help researchers identify which parts of the mitochondrion were responsible for specific processes, such as oxidative phosphorylation.

- #cell-organization, #mitochondria, #fractionation

## Explain Rasmussen's perspective on the different approaches taken by Palade and Sjöstrand in their research

Rasmussen maintained that a fundamental difference between Palade and Sjöstrand involved their respective relations to biochemistry. Sjöstrand emphasized the authority of the electron microscope, potentially conflicting with biochemists. In contrast, Palade's Rockefeller approach involved a partnership with fractionation biochemists, setting modest goals for electron microscopy to describe topology and associations among components in situ, thereby avoiding conflicts.

- #historiography, #electron-microscopy, #biochemistry

## How did the approach to fractionation by Rockefeller researchers differ from the perspective discussed in Part 2 of the chapter?

The Rockefeller researchers, including Palade, treated fractionation as a primary tool in their research, which helped link cell structures to biochemical operations. While Rasmussen viewed this as minimizing territorial conflicts, an alternative view treats it as an internally motivated scientific program that inherently minimized conflicts. This emphasizes scientific progress over sociological factors.

## Describe the two types of electron transport particles (ETP) in Green's research, their functions, and the findings related to their structure.

Green identified two types of electron transport particles (ETP):

- **Non-phosphorylating ETP**: These support phosphorylation when oxidizing compounds such as succinate.
- **Phosphorylating ETP (PETP)**: These support phosphorylation when oxidizing compounds other than succinate.

Electron microscopy revealed open fragments of cristae in PETP, indicating a more functional state, while non-phosphorylating ETP had less functional closed fragments of cristae. This supports the idea that oxidative phosphorylation processes are localized in the cristae.

## Summarize the four complexes involved in the electron transport chain as identified by Youssef Hatefi.

Youssef Hatefi identified four complexes in the electron transport chain:

- **Complex I**: NADH-ubiquinone reductase complex (includes FMN and nonheme iron)
- **Complex II**: Succinate-ubiquinone reductase complex (includes FAD and nonheme iron)
- **Complex III**: Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (includes cytochromes $b$ and $c_1$, and a nonheme iron protein)
- **Complex IV**: Cytochrome $c$ oxidase complex (includes cytochrome $a$ and copper)

These complexes are critical for the stepwise transfer of electrons and the generation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, which drives ATP synthesis.

- #cell-biology, #electron-transport, #biochemistry

## Explain the significance of Green's lab reconstituting two systems to demonstrate oxidation processes involving NADH and succinate.

Green's lab successfully reconstituted two systems:

1. A system oxidizing NADH to CO$_2$ and H$_2$O by combining complexes I, III, and IV.
2. A system oxidizing succinate to CO$_2$ and H$_2$O by combining complexes II, III, and IV.

This reconstitution demonstrated that the electron transport chain could function as a fixed assembly, with the components in advantageous spatial relations for sequential electron transfer. The particulate structures observed in these systems suggested a highly organized mitochondrial respiratory chain.

## Discuss the historical significance of Hans Ris' contribution to Green's research, and his decision to suggest Green work with Fernández-Morán.

Hans Ris' collaboration with Green involved using electron microscopy to study the structure of electron transport particles. Ris' background in cytology and electron microscopy added significant value to the understanding of mitochondrial structures. However, Ris found Green's approach lacking in sensitivity to cytological details and suggested moving the collaboration to Fernández-Morán at the University of Chicago, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary expertise in complex biochemical research.

## Describe the process used by Lehninger and colleagues to isolate "phosphorylating membrane fragments" from rat liver mitochondria.

Lehninger and his team treated isolated mitochondria with digitonin, breaking down membrane lipids and causing the "virtual dissolution" of the mitochondrion. The solution was centrifuged at $50,000 \mathrm{~g}$ for 25 minutes, and the supernatant fluid was further centrifuged at $100,000 \mathrm{~g}$ for 25 minutes, yielding "phosphorylating membrane fragments."

- #bioenergetics, #biochemistry.mitochondria

## Which biochemical agents were found to decouple respiration from phosphorylation in the study by Lehninger and colleagues?

Most typical agents like 2,4-dinitrophenol decoupled respiration from phosphorylation, but $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and thyroxine did not.

- #bioenergetics, #biochemistry.respiration

## What conclusion was derived about the locations of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation based on Lehninger's findings?

The findings suggested that the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion, while electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation occur in the cristae of the inner mitochondrial membrane.

- #bioenergetics, #cell-biology.mitochondria

## What did the use of sonic vibrations before centrifugation demonstrate regarding the inner membrane of mitochondria?

The use of sonic vibrations prior to centrifugation greatly reduced the sedimentation rate but not the efficacy of the particles, leading Lehninger and Cooper to conclude that the inner membrane consisted of repetitive structures.

## What is the significance of the reaction between cytochrome c and oxygen in cellular respiration?

The reaction between cytochrome $c$ and oxygen is crucial in cellular respiration as it plays a key role in the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons and contributing to the generation of ATP.

## What are the main steps involved in oxidative phosphorylation according to Lehninger and colleagues?

According to Lehninger and colleagues, oxidative phosphorylation involves separate, sequential steps:

- Phosphate and ADP enter into oxidative phosphorylation in separate steps.
- The enzyme first reacts with the phosphate, creating a high-energy intermediate (e.g., $\mathrm{X} \sim \mathrm{P}$).
- The intermediate then reacts with ADP to form ATP.

$$
\text{Enzyme} + \text{Phosphate (P)} \rightarrow \text{High-energy intermediate} \rightarrow \text{Intermediate} + \text{ADP} \rightarrow \text{ATP}
$$

- #biochemistry, #enzymatic-reaction.oxidative-phosphorylation

---

## Explain the difference between the two alternatives considered by Lehninger and colleagues for the final events in phosphorylation.

Lehninger and colleagues considered two alternatives for the final events in phosphorylation:

1. The enzyme reacts first with phosphate, creating a high-energy intermediate (e.g., $\mathrm{X} \sim \mathrm{P}$), which then reacts with ADP to form ATP.
2. The enzyme reacts first with ADP, creating an intermediate (e.g., $\mathrm{X} \sim \mathrm{ADP}$), which then reacts with phosphate.

The evidence from the exchange reaction supported the first alternative where the enzyme first reacts with phosphate.

$$
\text{Alternative 1:} \quad \mathrm{X} + \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{X} \sim \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{X} + \mathrm{ATP}
$$

$$
\text{Alternative 2:} \quad \mathrm{X} + \mathrm{ADP} \rightarrow \mathrm{X} \sim \mathrm{ADP} \rightarrow \mathrm{X} + \mathrm{ATP}
$$

## Describe the exchange reactions involved in oxidative phosphorylation and their inhibition by decoupling agents as studied by Cooper and Lehninger.

The exchange reactions in oxidative phosphorylation involve:

1. Exchange of a free phosphate with one in ATP.
2. Transfer of a phosphate from an ATP molecule to an ADP molecule.

These reactions occur in digitonin-prepared particles and are inhibited by decoupling agents. The inhibition by decoupling agents indicates the importance of coupled processes in oxidative phosphorylation.

$$
\text{Reaction 1: } \mathrm{ATP} + \mathrm{Pi} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{ATP-Pi}
$$

$$
\text{Reaction 2: } \mathrm{ATP} + \mathrm{ADP} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{ATP-ADP}
$$

1. Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol, converting glucose to pyruvate with a net production of 2 ATP molecules and reduction of NAD+ to NADH.
2. The Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle) takes place in the mitochondrial matrix, processing pyruvate (after conversion to acetyl CoA) to produce CO2, ATP, and reducing NAD+ to NADH and FAD to FADH2.
3. The Electron Transport Chain is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane (cristae), using electrons from NADH and FADH2 to pump protons, creating a gradient that drives ATP synthesis (oxidative phosphorylation), yielding approximately 34 ATP molecules.

## Describe the role of NADH and FADH2 in the electron transport chain as depicted in the diagram.

%
In the electron transport chain, NADH and FADH2 are responsible for donating electrons. These electrons travel through the chain and their energy is used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient drives ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation.

- #cellular-biology.cellular-respiration, #biochemistry.redox-reactions, #mitochondrial-function


## What is the mechanism proposed by Lehninger for the generation of high-energy bonds in oxidative phosphorylation? 

Lehninger proposed that it was the oxidized carrier (the cytochrome surrendering the electrons) that formed the high-energy bond. This conclusion was based on evidence from exchange reactions showing that the reactions occurred at a maximal rate when the carriers were kept in a fully oxidized state, but not in a reduced one.

- #bioenergetics, #oxidative-phosphorylation

## According to Lehninger, what happens at the first phosphorylation site in the electron transport chain?

At the first site, the oxidation results in DPN forming a high-energy bond with the enzyme ($\mathrm{DPN} \sim \mathrm{X}$). Inorganic phosphate then replaces DPN in the bond, yielding $\mathrm{P} \sim \mathrm{X}$. Finally, ADP replaces the enzyme ($\mathrm{X}$), producing ATP and releasing the enzyme.

$$
\text{DPN} + \text{X} \rightarrow \text{DPN} \sim \text{X} \\
\text{DPN} \sim \text{X} + \text{Pi} \rightarrow \text{P} \sim \text{X} + \text{DPN} \\
\text{P} \sim \text{X} + \text{ADP} \rightarrow \text{ATP} + \text{X}
$$

- #bioenergetics, #electron-transport-chain, #phosphorylation

## What is the significance of the carriers being kept in a fully oxidized state in Lehninger's mechanism?

The significance is that the reactions involved in the generation of high-energy bonds occur at a maximal rate when the carriers are in a fully oxidized state. This supported Lehninger's proposal that it is the oxidized carrier that forms the high-energy bond with the enzyme.

- #bioenergetics, #oxidation-reduction, #mechanism

## What role does inorganic phosphate ($\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$) play in the oxidative phosphorylation mechanism proposed by Lehninger?

Inorganic phosphate ($\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$) replaces the carrier in the high-energy bond with the enzyme, forming $\mathrm{P} \sim \mathrm{X}$. This is a crucial step before ADP replaces the enzyme to form ATP.

## What is illustrated in Lehninger's conception of the coupling of the electron transport chain with oxidative phosphorylation?

%

Lehninger's conception illustrates the coupling of the electron transport chain with oxidative phosphorylation via high-energy intermediates. The diagram shows three different enzymes (denoted as $\mathrm{X}$, $\mathrm{Y}$, and $\mathrm{Z}$), inorganic phosphate ($\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$), and substances acting as carriers undergoing reversible oxidation-reduction reactions. The process involves the sequential transport of electrons through various carriers like cytochrome b (CYT b), cytochrome c (CYT c), and a truncated cytochrome oxidase (CYT O to CYT O3), culminating in the synthesis of ATP from ADP and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$. The final electron acceptor is molecular oxygen, leading to the formation of water. The high-energy bonds (denoted by $\sim$) play a critical role in the ATP synthesis process.

## Explain the principle of negative staining used in Fernández-Morán's study and its purpose in electron microscopy.

Negative staining involves using electron-dense but chemically inert substances such as phosphotungstate or uranyl acetate.

### Card 1

#### What were the three proposals for the significance of spherical particles on the mitochondrial inner membrane according to Figure 6.7?

1. Green's 1963 proposal suggested that each inner membrane sphere contained an entire electron transport chain (ETC).
2. Green's revised proposal distributed the complexes into a tripartite repeating unit: 
   - Complexes I and II in the base piece
   - Complex III in the stalk
   - Complex IV in the head piece
3. Racker's account localized ATPase in the inner membrane spheres and the ETC in the inner membrane itself.

### Card 2

#### What was Green's initial hypothesis in 1963 regarding the inner membrane spheres, and how did it change in his revised proposal?

Initially, Green hypothesized that each inner membrane sphere contained an entire electron transport chain (ETC). However, this hypothesis was revised to the idea that the ETC complexes were distributed in a tripartite repeating unit:
- Complexes I and II were contained in the base piece.
- Complex III was in the stalk.
- Complex IV was in the head piece.

### Card 3

#### According to Lehninger (1964), what was the major quantitative issue with Green's 1963 proposal about the inner membrane spheres containing the entire ETC?

Lehninger calculated that the weight of the respiratory assembly was one to two orders of magnitude greater than that of the inner membrane spheres. This creates a significant discrepancy, suggesting that the entire ETC could not be contained within these spherical particles as initially proposed by Green.

## Explain the localization of enzyme complexes I and II based on biochemical considerations.

Enzyme complexes I and II must interact with DPNH and succinate, respectively, both of which are localized in the interior of the crista.

%

The interior of the crista provides a necessary environment for these interactions due to the presence of DPNH and succinate. As stated in the paper, "Complexes I and II must interact with DPNH and succinate, respectively, both of which are localized in the interior of the crista." This localization is critical for the efficient functioning of these complexes in electron transport.

## What speculative proposal did Green attribute to Robert Bock and Robert Criddle in Scientific American 1964?

The speculative proposal by Green, attributed to Robert Bock and Robert Criddle, suggested that the transport of substrates between enzymes was accomplished by "means of swinging groups of atoms, mounted on the respective proteins by flexible arms, that transfer and accept the electrons."

Green offered this proposal to address the issue of electron transport between enzymes. This method hypothesized the existence of flexible arms on proteins that could effectively transfer and accept electrons as needed, even though it did not address the accompanying phosphorylation.

## What technique did Racker, Parsons, and Chance use to examine F_o preparations, and what did they find?

Racker, Parsons, and Chance used the negative staining technique to examine $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{o}}$ preparations and found that they were sac-shaped structures covered with "inner membrane spheres."

%

By employing the negative staining technique, Racker and his collaborators observed that $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{o}}$ preparations displayed sac-like structures adorned with inner membrane spheres similar to those found by Fernández-Morán. These structures indicated potential locations for enzymatic activity.

## How did Racker conclude that spheres contained ATPase and were the locus of ATP synthesis?

Racker concluded that the spheres contained ATPase and were the locus of ATP synthesis after observing spheres about $85 \AA \degree$ in diameter in $F_{1}$ factor preparations and noting phosphorylation was restored when $\mathrm{F}_{2}$, $\mathrm{F}_{3}$, and $\mathrm{F}_{4}$ were added to the trypsin-urea membrane preparation.

%

Racker's research indicated that the presence and addition of $F_{1}$, $F_{2}$, $F_{3}$, and $F_{4}$ factors were essential for restoring phosphorylation in the membrane preparation. The diameter of the spheres ($85 \AA \degree$) correlated with the ATPase structure, thus leading to the conclusion that these spheres were the loci of ATP synthesis.

## How did Keilin and Hartree's (1944) findings inform the understanding of mitochondrial particulate structure in oxidative phosphorylation?

Keilin and Hartree (1944) discovered that they could not eliminate cell particulates from extract preparations capable of performing oxidative phosphorylation, which indicated that the respiratory function was connected with the physico-chemical structure of the cell. 

- #biochemistry, #cell-mechanisms.mitochondrion, #oxidative-phosphorylation


## What was the "nuisance" regarding cell particulates according to Lehninger (1951)?

Lehninger (1951) referred to the involvement of cell particulates as a nuisance because most biochemists aimed to work out the purely chemical steps in oxidative phosphorylation, similar to how glycolysis was understood. Cell particulates complicated this objective by adding a physical dimension to biochemical processes.

- #biochemistry, #cell-mechanisms.mitochondrion, #research-approaches


## What theoretical contribution did Lippman (1941) make regarding ATP?

Lippman (1941) characterized the phosphate bonds in ATP as energy-rich bonds and introduced the symbol $\sim \mathrm{P}$ for these bonds. These bonds were later commonly referred to as high-energy bonds.

- #biochemistry, #cell-mechanisms.ATP, #energy-storage


## Describe the role of glycolysis in substrate-level phosphorylation.

In glycolysis, the initial substrate (glucose) and the penultimate product (pyruvic acid) do not contain phosphates, but various intermediates do. Phosphates are added at three different steps in the process and transferred to ADP in later steps, yielding energy-rich ATP. This process is known as substrate-level phosphorylation.

- #biochemistry, #cell-mechanisms.glycolysis, #substrate-level-phosphorylation

## How did Racker's research contribute to our understanding of oxidative phosphorylation?

Racker's research localized the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the ATPase in the spheres attached to the membrane. This provided a structural basis for biochemists to understand how the oxidation-reduction reactions of electron transport might be linked to ATP synthesis.

- #biochemistry, #oxidative-phosphorylation, #mitochondrial-function


## What problem were biochemists still facing even after localization of the electron transport chain and ATPase?

Biochemists were still seeking chemical intermediates that linked the oxidation-reduction reactions of electron transport to ATP synthesis. In Slater's scheme, a hypothetical compound C was thought to form a high-energy bond with the substrate and transfer that bond to ADP. In Lehninger's model, enzymes X, Y, and Z played a role at the three phosphorylation sites along the electron transport chain.

- #biochemistry, #oxidative-phosphorylation, #electron-transport-chain  


## What was Peter Mitchell's revolutionary concept regarding oxidative phosphorylation?

In 1961, Peter Mitchell proposed that the crucial intermediary in oxidative phosphorylation was a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, not a chemical compound. He suggested that as respiratory substrates were oxidized by the electron transport chain, protons ($\mathrm{H}^{+}$) were discharged on one side of the membrane and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ ions on the other. This proton gradient bearing an electrical potential was key in driving the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate.

- #biochemistry, #oxidative-phosphorylation, #mitchell-hypothesis


## How does the proton gradient described by Peter Mitchell link to ATP synthesis?

The proton gradient results in a higher concentration of protons in the intermembrane space of the cristae than in the mitochondrial matrix. This gradient provides the energy needed for ATPase to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate when operating in reverse, rather than breaking it down.

- #biochemistry, #oxidative-phosphorylation, #proton-gradient

## What was the central component of Mitchell's mechanism in the chemiosmotic hypothesis? Why was it controversial?

The central component of Mitchell's mechanism in the chemiosmotic hypothesis was the idea of a proton gradient across a membrane. This was controversial for two main reasons: empirical and theoretical. 

Empirically, there was skepticism about the evidence supporting the existence of the claimed proton gradient. Theoretically, the concept of a proton gradient was unfamiliar to many biochemists, who were more accustomed to soluble systems models to explain metabolic processes.

- #biochemistry, #chemiosmotic-hypothesis
  
## Describe the shift in perspective about cell mechanisms due to Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis and its acceptance in the scientific community.

Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis was initially highly controversial but gradually gained support through empirical evidence and advocacy from influential biochemists like Efraim Racker. The hypothesis linked electron transport with phosphorylation, transforming the understanding of oxidative phosphorylation by integrating morphological structure and chemical operations, particularly the role of cristae in creating a proton motive force that drives ATP synthesis.

- #biochemistry, #chemiosmotic-hypothesis, #scientific-transformation
  
## What role did Racker play in the acceptance of the chemiosmotic hypothesis, and what were the consequences of his actions?

Racker played a pivotal role by proposing the preparation of a joint statement to mitigate the acrimony over oxidative phosphorylation and later supporting the chemiosmotic hypothesis through his own contributions. His actions helped foster a more collaborative atmosphere, leading to the publication of a joint introductory statement, followed by individual papers in the Annual Review of Biochemistry in 1977, which ultimately aided in the acceptance of Mitchell's hypothesis.

- #biochemistry, #scientific-collaboration, #chemiosmotic-hypothesis
  
## Explain how Palade's cristae were involved in the mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation according to the chemiosmotic hypothesis.

Palade's cristae were understood to not only house the critical enzymes of electron transport in a spatially organized manner but also to play a crucial role in creating the proton motive force necessary for ATP synthesis. The cristae's function in generating this proton gradient became an integral part of the comprehensive mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation, illustrating how morphological structures are intertwined with biochemical functions.

## Explain Peter Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis including the primary concept of energy transfers involved at a basic level.

Peter Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis postulates that the energy generated during oxidative phosphorylation is stored as a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane. This gradient, also known as the proton motive force (PMF), is then used to drive the synthesis of ATP. The primary concept involves the movement of protons (H⁺ ions) across the membrane which harbors both electrical and chemical energy potential.

- #biochemistry, #chemiosmotic-hypothesis.proton-gradient


## Describe the relationship between mitochondrial membrane proton gradients and ATP synthesis according to the chemiosmotic hypothesis.

The chemiosmotic hypothesis posits that the energy generated from electron transport is used to pump protons (H⁺ ions) from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, creating a proton gradient. This gradient creates both a pH difference and an electrochemical potential across the membrane, termed the proton motive force (PMF). ATP synthesis is driven by the flow of protons back into the mitochondrial matrix through ATP synthase, which utilizes the PMF to convert ADP and inorganic phosphate ($P_{i}$) into ATP.

## According to the paper, how does the increase or decrease in the width of an arrow represent energy transfers in the context of the chemiosmotic hypothesis?

In the context of Peter Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis, an increase in the width of an arrow within schematic representations indicates that energy is being gained during that particular process, while a decrease in the width of an arrow indicates that energy is being expended.

## Describe how the proton gradient is established according to Peter Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis. 

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_07_05_cc05a12437f6d2dfd41eg-1.jpg?height=967&width=1783&top_left_y=206&top_left_x=253)

%

In Peter Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis for oxidative phosphorylation, the proton gradient is established by the active transport of protons (H+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space. This process is driven by energy released from electrons moving through the electron transport chain, originating from the citric acid cycle. The difference in proton concentration across the inner membrane creates what is known as the proton motive force, which stores potential energy.

%

In Peter Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis for oxidative phosphorylation, ATP synthase plays a crucial role in synthesizing ATP from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This process is driven by the flow of protons (H+) back into the mitochondrial matrix through ATP synthase, utilizing the energy stored in the proton gradient created across the inner mitochondrial membrane.

## How did Porter and Kallman describe the endoplasmic reticulum in their papers of 1952 and 1953?

Porter and Kallman described the endoplasmic reticulum as a vesicular or canalicular material within the innermost cytoplasm, termed as the 'endoplasm.' They noted it as a finely divided vacuolar system, which varied in size across different cells depending on the physiological state of the cell at fixation time.

## What did Porter and Thompson find in tumor cells that was reported by other electron microscope laboratories?

Porter and Thompson found specific particles in tumor cells that were subsequently also observed by other electron microscope laboratories (Cannan & Berger, 1951; Oberling et al., 1950). These particles were found to be limited to tumor cells, suggesting a possible connection to growth processes.

- #cell-biology, #cancer-research
  
## What was Porter and Kallman's hypothesis regarding the particles found in rapidly growing cells?

Porter and Kallman hypothesized that the particles found in rapidly growing cells, which they termed "growth granules," are linked to the production of new protoplasm. They suggested these particles might contain a large amount of ribonucleotides, indicating they are involved in cytoplasmic multiplication.

## How did Porter and Kallman associate these particles with the microsomal fraction from fractionation studies?

Porter and Kallman, relying on absorption studies with ultraviolet microscopy, concluded the particles found in rapidly growing cells were rich in ribonucleotides. They associated these particles with the microsomal fraction of cells from fractionation studies, suggesting a role in cytoplasmic synthesis.

## What was the significance of the improvement in techniques for making micrographs of thin-sliced cells in the field of cytoplasmic research in the 1940s?

The improvement in techniques for making micrographs of thin-sliced cells allowed for better visualization of cytoplasmic structures, such as the filamentous units noted by Albert Dalton (1951a; Dalton et al., 1950). This advancement led to more detailed observations of cellular components, which had previously been seen predominantly in whole, cultured cells.

- #microscopy, #cell-biology

## What did Porter and Blum discover about the nature of the elongated elements in the cytoplasm based on their micrographs of thin sections?

Porter and Blum discovered that the 'elongated elements' in the cytoplasm had a relatively 'transparent' center, bounded by a single dense line representing a membrane. They identified these elements as part of the endoplasmic reticulum.

- #biology, #cytology.endoplasmic-reticulum

## What was Dalton's conclusion about the form of the ergastoplasmic structures, and what evidence did he provide to support this?

Dalton concluded that the ergastoplasmic structures were lamellae rather than filaments or tubules. He provided evidence from electron microscope observations that these components stayed in focus while the focus of the electron microscope was changed, indicating a lamellar form.

- #cell-biology, #microscopy.ergastoplasmic-structures

## According to Porter and Blum, what were the limitations of micrographs of thin sliced cells in studying the endoplasmic reticulum?

Porter and Blum noted that micrographs of thin sliced cells lacked a three-dimensional perspective, making it difficult to fully understand the form and structure of the endoplasmic reticulum. They emphasized the importance of serial sections to obtain three-dimensional views.

- #cell-biology, #microscopy.endoplasmic-reticulum

## What specific observations did Porter and Blum make about the endoplasmic reticulum in their serial sections study?

Porter and Blum observed that the endoplasmic reticulum is a complex system of interconnected strands and sinusoids. These structures tended to be flattened in one dimension but were otherwise polymorphic.

## Why is it significant that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) appears differently in sections of cells in situ compared to whole mounts of tissue-cultured cells?

Palade and Porter argued that the appearance of the ER in sections of tissue-cultured cells should differ from whole mounts because the connections within the ER are severed by the microtome, resulting in vesicles and strands rather than a network.

### Card 1

What structures are compared in the micrographs presented by Palade and Porter, and what differences do they highlight about the endoplasmic reticulum?

%

The micrographs compare the appearance of the endoplasmic reticulum in whole tissue-cultured cells (top) and in thin sections (bottom). The top micrograph shows detailed structures such as canaliculi and vesicles within the cytoplasm, while the bottom image presents the endoplasmic reticulum as a continuous, network-like structure. These comparisons illustrate that the observed cellular components are consistent across different cell preparation methods, confirming their genuine nature.

## What did Palade note about the difficulties of interpreting thin sections of the endoplasmic reticulum?

The usual thickness of such sections, 20 to $40 \mu \mathrm{m}$, being much smaller than the mesh size of the reticulum, and even smaller than the diameter of the vesicles and tubules that form its trabeculae, leads to only slices of these trabeculae or "profiles" being found. Fragments of meshes, or more or less complete meshes, are only occasionally encountered, and the continuity of the system throughout the cytoplasm is never apparent. This continuity can only be regained by the difficult and tedious operation of tridimensional reconstruction.

- #biology, #cell-biology.endoplasmic-reticulum, #microtomy.sections

## Why was the use of spread cells as initial specimens for the study of the endoplasmic reticulum considered fortunate?

The main feature of the endoplasmic reticulum system, i.e., its disposition in a continuous reticulum that permeates the entire cytoplasm, would have been extremely difficult, if not impossible, to grasp from the exclusive study of thin sections. Spread cells provide a more continuous and comprehensible view of the reticulum.

- #cell-biology.endoplasmic-reticulum, #biology.study-methods

## What were the conflicting descriptions and names caused by the shift from spread to sectioned specimens?

The shift from spread to sectioned specimens caused a number of conflicting descriptions and interpretations of the endoplasmic reticulum system. Various names were proposed for structures belonging to the system under consideration, leading to confusion and terminological disagreements.

## Discuss the contrasting observations made by Porter and Sjöstrand about the endoplasmic reticulum.

Both Porter and Sjöstrand studied the endoplasmic reticulum but arrived at different conclusions. While Porter observed that the endoplasmic reticulum mainly consisted of large, flat cisternae with fine granular material on the outer surface, Sjöstrand criticized this view and argued that the cytoplasm was divided into open compartments through well-defined intracellular double membranes. Moreover, Sjöstrand and Rhodin identified small opaque particles attached to one side of these membranes.

- #cell-biology, #endoplasmic-reticulum

---

## Explain the significance of fine granular material found on the endoplasmic reticulum by Palade.

Palade observed that the outer surface of the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum was often coated with fine granular material, ranging from 10 to $30 \mu m$ in size. This granular material was significant because Porter argued that it was the source of basophilic staining in the cytoplasm. Porter related these granules to particles containing large amounts of RNA, identified in previous studies, and he concluded that similar particles were present in the nucleolus.

- #cell-biology, #endoplasmic-reticulum.granular-material

---

## Describe the initial skepticism Porter had towards the particles observed by Palade.

Porter initially responded to the granular particles seen by Palade on the endoplasmic reticulum with skepticism, suggesting that they were likely artifacts caused by damage from the electron beam. He even referred to them sarcastically as "Palade particles." Over time, however, evidence increasingly supported the presence of these particles and their physiological significance.

- #cell-biology, #scientific-debate.skepticism

## How did Porter link the fine granular material on the endoplasmic reticulum to basophilic staining in the cytoplasm?

Porter observed that the fine granular material on the endoplasmic reticulum caused significant basophilic staining in tissues where these granules were attached. He suggested that these particles were the basophilic components of the cytoplasm. Furthermore, he related these particles to a fraction containing large amounts of RNA, similar to the fraction identified by Barnum and Huseby, and observed particles of the same size in the nucleolus.

## According to Lippman (1946), what two-step scheme is proposed for ATP synthesis along the electron transport chain, similar to glycolysis?

Lippman (1946) proposed the following two-step scheme for ATP synthesis along the electron transport chain:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{AH}_{2}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A} \sim \mathrm{P}+\mathrm{BH}_{2} \\
& \mathrm{~A} \sim \mathrm{P}+\mathrm{ADP} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{ATP} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The overall summary reaction is:

$$
\mathrm{AH}_{2}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{BH}_{2}+\mathrm{ATP} .
$$

- $\mathrm{A}$ denotes a substrate which is oxidized in the first reaction coupled with the reduction of another substrate, $\mathrm{B}$. As $\mathrm{A}$ is oxidized, it forms a high-energy bond with phosphate. In the second reaction, this bond is transferred to ADP, synthesizing ATP.

- #biochemistry, #atp-synthesis, #electron-transport-chain

## According to E.C. Slater (1953), how did the proposed scheme for ATP formation change, and what was the hypothesized new compound?

E.C. Slater (1953) revised Lipmann's proposed scheme by introducing an additional compound, $\mathrm{C}$, that first forms a high-energy bond with $\mathrm{A}$. The reactions are:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{AH}_{2}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{C} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A} \sim \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{BH}_{2} \\
\mathrm{~A} \sim \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{ATP}
\end{gathered}
$$

The overall summary reaction remained:

$$
\mathrm{AH}_{2}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{BH}_{2}+\mathrm{ATP} .
$$

The hypothesized additional compound $\mathrm{C}$ was believed to facilitate the uptake of phosphate into ATP.

- #biochemistry, #atp-synthesis, #electron-transport-chain

## In the derivation of ATP synthesizing reactions, what roles do $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ play, according to the Lippman and Slater models?

In the Lippman and Slater models, $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ have the following roles:

- $\mathrm{A}$: A substrate that is oxidized in the first reaction, forming a high-energy bond with phosphate.
- $\mathrm{B}$: Another substrate that is reduced during the oxidation of $\mathrm{A}$.

In the Lippman model:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{AH}_{2}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} &\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A} \sim \mathrm{P}+\mathrm{BH}_{2} \\
\mathrm{A} \sim \mathrm{P}+\mathrm{ADP} &\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{ATP}
\end{aligned}
$$

In the Slater model:
$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{AH}_{2}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{C} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A} \sim \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{BH}_{2} \\
\mathrm{~A} \sim \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{ATP}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Describe the summary formula that represents the overall effect of the ATP synthesis scheme proposed by Lippman (1946) and Slater (1953).

The overall summary formula representing the effect of ATP synthesis in both schemes (Lippman and Slater) is:

$$

## Explain the orientation of intracellular membranes as described by Sjöstrand and Hanzon (1954).

According to Sjöstrand and Hanzon (1954), the intracellular membranes have specific orientations: mitochondria, zymogen granules, and the cell membrane have their rough side facing these structures, while cytoplasmic membranes adjacent to the nuclear membrane have their smooth surface directed towards the nuclear membrane.

## Discuss the significance of the opaque particles observed in osmium tetroxide preparations according to Sjöstrand.

Sjöstrand noted that the opaque particles in the cytoplasm react very strongly with osmium tetroxide and suggested that:

$$
\text{they represent the dominating structure of the cytoplasm of the exocrine pancreas cells.}
$$

He inferred that these structures are important for enzyme synthesis in these cells.

- #cell-biology, #cytoplasm.particles

## Explain why Sjöstrand rejected the interpretation that certain structures identified by other microscopists were filaments.

Sjöstrand argued that the structures in question were membranes and not filaments due to their continuous visibility through the whole basal cell zone. Specifically, he stated:

$$
\text{the chance to hit a filament so exactly along its entire length is negligible, and there are no indications of cross-cut filaments.}
$$

- #cell-biology, #cytoplasm.structures

## What was Sjöstrand's argument regarding the number of membranes near the nucleus, and what conclusion did he derive?

In his paper with Hanzon, Sjöstrand noted:

$$
\text{The number of membranes in the cell was always odd, due to the innermost membrane not having a partner.}
$$

He concluded that this would not be the case if the structures were filaments, reinforcing his interpretation that they are indeed membranes.

- #cell-biology, #cell-structure.membranes

## What was Sjöstrand’s main argument at the Eighth Congress of Cell Biology symposium regarding the generalization of cytoplasmic structures?

At the symposium, Sjöstrand related his observations to those of other scientists and cautioned against overgeneralization:

$$
\text{For the moment we may not generalize further than accepting that in the cytoplasm there exist granules.}
$$

He emphasized the importance of not assuming all observed structures have a common chemical and functional significance.

## What was the limitation of the term "endoplasmic reticulum" as discussed by Porter in 1953?

The term "endoplasmic reticulum" is considered vague and almost indicates anything in the ground substance of the cytoplasm. This diffuse classification does not help in systematizing the structural components of protoplasm.

## What role did Paul Zamecnik play in the biochemical studies of protein synthesis?

Paul Zamecnik at the Huntington Laboratory of Massachusetts General Hospital played a significant role in biochemical studies of protein synthesis. He worked in a landscape dominated by two main ideas: Max Bergmann's proposal of cathepsin enzymes catalyzing peptide bonds and Fritz Lipmann's idea of a phosphorylated intermediate causing peptide bonds.

- #biochemistry, #protein-synthesis

## What was the fundamental strategy used to study protein synthesis and the formation of peptide bonds?

The strategy to study protein synthesis involved tracing the uptake of radioactively labeled amino acids into protein to identify the fraction in which it appeared. This methodology aimed to observe the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids to form polypeptide chains.

## What does the formation of a peptide bond between glycine and alanine involve?

The formation of a peptide bond between glycine and alanine involves the removal of a water molecule.

The process can be represented by:

$$
\text{Glycine} + \text{Alanine} \rightarrow \text{Peptide bond} + \text{Water}
$$

- #biology.cell-mechanisms, #chemistry.peptide-bonds

## Explain the use of $\mathrm{C}^{14}$-labeled amino acids in Zamecnik's studies. 

$\mathrm{C}^{14}$-labeled amino acids were used to trace the uptake of amino acids, such as alanine and glycine, into tissue slices from both normal and malignant rats.

$$
\text{Labeled amino-acid} (\mathrm{C}^{14}) \xrightarrow{\text{Absorption}} \text{Tissue slices}
$$

## What was the procedure used by Elizabeth Keller to study $\mathrm{C}^{14}$-labeled amino acids in rats, and what did she find?

Elizabeth Keller injected rats with low doses of $\mathrm{C}^{14}$-labeled amino acids, formed a homogenate from their liver cells, and centrifuged it. In rats sacrificed within twenty minutes, she found most of the labeled amino acids in the microsomal fraction, but not after longer delays.

### What basic steps are involved in the creation of peptide bonds in proteins?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_07_05_66dd054e60456da11f1bg-1.jpg?height=316&width=377&top_left_y=703&top_left_x=872)

%

The creation of peptide bonds in proteins involves the following basic steps:

- Two amino acids come together, with their respective structures featuring an amino group (NH2), a central carbon (C), a hydrogen atom (H), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
- A reaction takes place where a water molecule (H2O) is removed.
- The bond forms between the amino group of one amino acid and the carboxyl group of another amino acid, leading to a peptide bond (C-N linking the two amino acids).

- #biology, #biochemistry, #protein-synthesis


### Describe the structure of a generic amino acid and explain how glycine and alanine bond together.

A generic amino acid structure includes:

- A central (alpha) carbon atom (C)
- An amino group (-NH2)
- A carboxylic acid group (-COOH)
- A hydrogen atom (H)
- An R group, which varies among different amino acids

For glycine and alanine to bond together:

- Glycine (left) consists of an -NH2 group, an alpha carbon with two hydrogen atoms, and a -COOH group.
- Alanine (right) has an -NH2 group, an alpha carbon bound to a methyl group (CH3), a hydrogen atom, and a -COOH group.
- During peptide bond formation, a water molecule (H2O) is removed, and the amino group of glycine bonds with the carboxylic acid group of alanine, forming a peptide bond between them.

## What were the main contributions of Philip Siekevitz to the study of protein synthesis when he was working with Zamecnik?

Philip Siekevitz adapted techniques from Hogeboom et al. to create a fraction containing both mitochondria and microsomes for studying the incorporation of labeled amino acids. He found that adding citric acid cycle intermediates increased incorporation and that adding ATP could foster incorporation even when respiration was suppressed.

- #biochemistry, #protein-synthesis, #historical-contributions

## Explain the role of ATP in the process of protein synthesis as revealed by Zamecnik, Keller, and Hoagland's studies.

Zamecnik, Keller, and Hoagland discovered that ATP interacted with amino acids, forming an amino acyl 〜 AMP compound. This reaction activates the amino acid, enabling it to form a peptide bond with another amino acid during protein synthesis.

$$
\text{Amino Acid} + \text{ATP} \rightarrow \text{Amino acyl-AMP} + \text{PPi}
$$

- #biochemistry, #protein-synthesis, #ATP

## What specific fractions and supplements were required for protein synthesis as discovered by Zamecnik and Elizabeth Keller?

Zamecnik and Elizabeth Keller showed that the microsomal and supernatant fractions were required for protein synthesis. These fractions needed to be supplemented by ATP and guanosine triphosphate (GTP).

- #biochemistry, #protein-synthesis, #cellular-fractions

## How did the Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer contribute to the advancements in protein synthesis research?

The Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer enabled further enhancements in the fractionation procedure. Using this device, Nancy Bucher demonstrated the incorporation of labeled acetate into cholesterol and subsequently into proteins, leading to significant advances in understanding protein synthesis.

- #biochemistry, #research-methods, #protein-synthesis

```latex
## How did Palade and Siekevitz describe the fragmentation process of the endoplasmic reticulum in their study?

Palade and Siekevitz described that preparing the homogenate resulted in “an extensive fragmentation of the networks into independent vesicles, tubules, and cisternae.” These fragments could then be centrifuged down into the homogenate pellets, along with other cell components.
 
- #cell-biology.general, #microscopy.electron

## What was the differentiation made between the microsomes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum?

Palade and Siekevitz identified microsomes as the rough endoplasmic reticulum, noting that microsomes contained small dense particles attached to their limiting membrane. They argued that Claude was correct in treating the microsomes as preformed components of the cytoplasm, but wrong in thinking of them as independent particles. Microsomes are actually parts of a “continuous, cell wide system; i.e., the endoplasmic reticulum.”
 
- #cell-biology.general, #biochemistry.protein-synthesis

## Describe the results obtained by Palade and Siekevitz when treating the microsomal fraction with deoxycholate and versene.

Treatment with deoxycholate eliminated the membrane, leaving the RNA-rich particles, whereas treatment with versene and ribonuclease eliminated the RNA-containing particles, leaving the membrane. This differentiation allowed them to conclude that RNA is found in the particles, while protein, phospholipids, and other components are present in the membrane.
 
- #cell-biology.general, #biochemistry.protein-synthesis
  
## How did Palade's findings in intestinal epithelium cells support the identification of RNA with the particles?

Palade found “numerous free particles evenly and randomly distributed throughout the cytoplasmic matrix” in developing cells of the intestinal epithelium, independent of the endoplasmic membrane. This contrasted with the endoplasmic reticulum, which appeared with fewer vesicles and tubules, many of them free of attached particles. These observations further supported the idea that RNA is contained within the particles.

- #cell-biology.general, #microscopy.electron 
```

   
## What are some potential roles of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in relation to the small granules associated with it according to Palade?

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may serve multiple roles in relation to the small granules:
- It could provide an appropriate surface for arranging the granules.
- Cavities in the ER might be in continuity with the extracellular medium, allowing raw materials from the exterior to reach the granules via the ER network.
- The ER could serve as storage space for cell products, as indicated by its distension in certain cells such as plasma cells and thyroid epithelia.

These functions suggest that the ER acts as feeding channels and storage space, facilitating the activity of the granules. The association is similar to locating plants along convenient ways of communication.
  
- #cell-biology, #endoplasmic-reticulum.functions

## Describe the patterns observed on the endoplasmic reticulum membranes according to Palade and how does he compare his observations?

Palade observed rather unusual patterns of particles on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, which he found intriguing. He likened his observations to the experience of French explorers during Napoleon's expedition to Egypt, who faced hieroglyphs and recorded patterns while awaiting a "biochemical Champollion" to decipher the meaning.

- #cell-biology, #endoplasmic-reticulum.observation

## What major insights did Rudolf Peter Heinrich Heidenhain contribute that influenced Palade's research on the endoplasmic reticulum?

Rudolf Peter Heinrich Heidenhain's research in 1875 on exocrine cells in the pancreas provided significant insights:
- He observed that granules in these cells disappeared after food intake and were replaced by new granules a few hours later.
- He concluded that these granules were precursors of digestive enzymes in pancreatic juice and that they served as temporary storage for proteolytic enzymes.
- He named these granules "zymogen granules."

These findings influenced Palade's exploration of the role and functions of granules associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.

- #cell-biology, #zymogen-granules.history    

## What experimental comparison did Siekevitz and Palade conduct related to the endoplasmic reticulum, and what were their findings?

Siekevitz and Palade conducted an experiment comparing the appearance of the endoplasmic reticulum in cells from guinea pigs that had been starved for forty-eight hours with those fed an hour before examination. They found that:
- In recently fed animals, the cavities of the endoplasmic reticulum appeared differently compared to those in starving animals, aligning with the suggested roles of the ER in storing and providing materials and enzymes.

This comparison helped illustrate the functional dynamics of the endoplasmic reticulum in different nutritional states.

- #cell-biology, #endoplasmic-reticulum.experiment

## What did Palade discover about proteolytic enzyme activity in starved versus recently fed animals?

Palade discovered that in starved animals, there was no appreciable proteolytic enzyme activity in microsomes. In contrast, in recently fed animals, the proteolytic enzyme activity in microsomes approximated that of the zymogen particles.

This indicates that feeding influences the concentration of these enzymes, suggesting their association with new protein synthesis, especially given their initial association with microsomal particles.

- #cell-biology, #protein-synthesis, #enzyme-activity

## What significance did Palade attribute to the granules in the endoplasmic reticulum?

Palade found that the granules within the cavities of the endoplasmic reticulum were biochemically identified for the first time as products of the endoplasmic reticulum, distinct from the zymogen granules.

This biochemical identification marks a major step in understanding the role of the endoplasmic reticulum in cell biology and protein synthesis.

- #cell-biology, #endoplasmic-reticulum, #protein-granules

## What evidence did Palade use to support the hypothesis that microsomal particles synthesized new proteins?

Palade cited evidence using labeled leucine-I-C ${ }^{14}$, showing that its earliest incorporation occurred in the particles still attached to the membrane. A little later, the label was found in the intracisternal granules and subsequently in the zymogen granules.

This time-sequenced incorporation suggests a pathway of protein synthesis starting from the microsomal particles, supporting the hypothesis of these particles being protein synthesis sites.

- #cell-biology, #protein-synthesis, #isotope-labeling

## What led to the adoption of the term "ribosome"?

During the first symposium of the Biophysical Society at MIT in 1958, participants faced semantic difficulties with the term "microsomal particles." The term "ribosome" was suggested to more accurately describe the ribonucleoprotein particles of the microsome fraction, eliminating confusion and resulting in its adoption.

The new term reflects both the composition and function of these particles more precisely, facilitating the standardization of scientific communication.

- #biophysics, #terminology, #ribosome

## What was one of the major unresolved issues regarding ribosomes discussed by Roberts in the symposium introduction?

Roberts highlighted the absence of a suggested mechanism that explained how the structure of the ribosome was compatible with its function as a template for synthesizing long chains of proteins.

- #biochemistry, #cell-biology.ribosome-function, #scientific-concepts.mechanism


## What was Zamecnik’s (1958) proposal about the process of protein synthesis?

Zamecnik proposed that protein synthesis involved an RNA template functioning as a biological equivalent of a printing press, specifying the order in which amino acids are linked. In his scheme, amino acids are first activated by binding with an enzyme and a molecule of ATP, which transfers a phosphate bond to an amino acid. The amino acids then bond sequentially on the RNA template, with bonds being established between adjacent amino acids through a "zipper reaction".

- #biochemistry, #molecular-biology.protein-synthesis, #scientific-concepts.RNA-template


## Describe the initial step involved in Zamecnik's proposed scheme for protein synthesis.

In Zamecnik's scheme, the initial step involves amino acids being activated by binding with an enzyme and a molecule of ATP. This results in the transfer of the phosphate bond to the amino acid, activating it for subsequent reactions.

$$
\text{Amino Acid} + \text{Enzyme} + \text{ATP} \rightarrow \text{Amino Acid-Enzyme-ATP complex}
$$

This activation is crucial for the amino acids to bond sequentially on the RNA template.

- #biochemistry, #protein-synthesis.activation, #enzymes.atp-interaction


## Why was it necessary to move to a lower level of organization in ribosome research?

To uncover the mechanism by which ribosomes synthesized proteins, it was essential to examine the chemical structures comprising the ribosome and their interactions. This decomposition was necessary to understand the specific operations at a biochemical level, which involved disciplines like biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology, rather than cell biology.

- #biochemistry, #molecular-biology.ribosome, #research-methods.organizational-level

## Explain the role of "soluble RNA" as discovered by Zamecnik and its subsequent renaming to transfer RNA (tRNA).

Zamecnik and his colleagues discovered that "soluble RNA" (S-RNA) binds with labeled leucine. Smith, Cordes, and Schweet later introduced the term "transfer RNA" (tRNA) to describe S-RNA, proposing its role in transferring activated amino acids to the microsomal RNA.

- #molecular-biology, #rna.transfer-rna

## Describe the concept of tRNA as an adaptor in protein synthesis, as proposed by Crick and Zamecnik.

Zamecnik and Crick proposed that tRNA serves as an adaptor, aligning with microsomal RNA through base-pairing to determine amino acid sequence during protein synthesis. This hypothesis was crucial in explaining the sequencing of amino acids.

- #molecular-biology, #protein-synthesis.mechanism

## Define the experimental contribution of Nirenberg and Matthaei in identifying messenger RNA (mRNA).

Nirenberg and Matthaei's experiments with uracil synthetic RNA led to the synthesis of phenylalanine-containing amino acid chains, providing the first indication of the genetic code and evidence for messenger RNA (mRNA) carrying protein information from the nucleus to the ribosome.

- #molecular-biology, #genetics.messenger-rna

## Explain how ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and tRNA interact during protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells.

In eukaryotic cells, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) directs the synthesis of peptides by remaining in place while tRNA brings specific amino acids to the template according to the sequence specified by the mRNA. The tRNA then departs after adding its amino acid to the growing chain.

- #molecular-biology, #protein-synthesis.ribosomal-rna

## Explain the role of proton gradient in oxidative phosphorylation.
Oxidative phosphorylation depends on the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. How is the energy used to drive oxidative phosphorylation stored?

The energy used to drive oxidative phosphorylation is stored in a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, not in a chemical intermediate.

## Which molecules are involved in the oxidation of fatty acids catalyzed by the complex enzyme system in ordinary liver preparations?
List the pathways and the end products of fatty acid oxidation in the liver.

The complex enzyme system in ordinary liver preparations catalyzes the oxidation of fatty acids via two possible pathways: 

1. Producing ketone bodies such as acetoacetate (acetoacetic acid).
2. Proceeding through the citric acid cycle and respiratory chain, producing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and consuming oxygen to generate $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

## How did Schneider’s initial experiments differ from later experiments by Kennedy and Lehninger in terms of oxidation of fatty acids?
Describe the setup and findings of Schneider’s initial experiments and contrast them with the findings of Kennedy and Lehninger.

Schneider’s initial experiments used water and saline suspensions of mitochondrial fractions with octanoate and necessary supplementary substances ($\mathrm{KCl}$, $\mathrm{MgSO}_4$, a "sparking” Krebs intermediate, cytochrome $c$, phosphate buffer, ATP) but found no significant oxidation. Whereas, Kennedy and Lehninger used $0.88 \mathrm{M}$ sucrose as the fractionation medium and observed oxidation in the mitochondrial fraction.

- #biochemistry.experimental-methods, #biochemistry.oxidation, #cell-mechanisms

## What was Lehninger's contribution to understanding mitochondrial function?
Summarize Lehninger's experiments and conclusions regarding the oxidation of octanoate in mitochondrial fractions.

Lehninger, along with his student Kennedy, demonstrated that the oxidation of the fatty acid octanoate occurred in the mitochondrial fraction when $0.88 \mathrm{M}$ sucrose was used as the fractionation medium. This was a crucial step in identifying the role of mitochondria in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation.

## Discuss the theoretical speculation made by Alexander Rich about the organization of ribosomes and mRNA. Explain Rich's conclusion on whether mRNA wraps around a ribosome.

Alexander Rich speculated:
- mRNA length: $\geq 1,500 \AA$ 
- Ribosome diameter: $\approx 230 \AA$
- Likely conclusion: mRNA does not wrap around ribosomes; instead, proteins are synthesized by multiple ribosomes coordinated together by mRNA.

1. Fractionation studies with rabbit reticulocytes.
2. Electron micrographs using metal shadowing and positive staining with uranyl acetate.

## What did the fractionation studies reveal about the presence of polysomes and their role in protein synthesis?

During fractionation studies, ultraviolet absorption characteristic of RNA revealed peaks corresponding to single ribosomes and heavier materials, presumably polysomes. Additionally, labeling amino acids with $\mathrm{C}^{14}$ identified that protein synthesis was occurring in the polysome fraction.

- #biology, #molecular-biology, #fractionation-study

---
## Explain the difference between the polysome assembly line and a human assembly line as noted by Rich.

In a human assembly line, the product moves down the line and component parts are added to it. Conversely, in the polysome assembly line, ribosomes move down the line and each one makes a complete product.

- #biology, #protein-synthesis, #assembly-line

---
## What did electron micrographs reveal about the structure and function of polysomes when positively stained with uranyl acetate?

Electron micrographs showed clusters of ribosomes connected by a thread with a diameter of 10 to $15 \AA$, corresponding to a single strand of RNA. This demonstrated the polysome structure and further supported its role in protein synthesis as ribosomes were found to be translocating along this RNA thread.

## What did Rich propose regarding the movement of ribosomes along the messenger RNA?

Rich proposed that the ribosomes move along the messenger RNA, adding the appropriate amino acid to the polypeptide chain it was constructing according to the instruction at that locus on the chain. He hypothesized a "ratchet-like mechanism" for this movement.

- #biology, #molecular-biology.ribosomes

## Describe the ratchet-like mechanism proposed by Rich for ribosome movement along the mRNA.

Rich's "ratchet-like mechanism" refers to a theoretical model where ribosomes progress along the messenger RNA in a step-by-step manner, guided by the mRNA's instructions, ensuring the correct amino acid is added to the polypeptide chain.

## Describe the significance of the peaks observed by Rich after using a homogenizer and centrifugation.

By using a homogenizer before centrifugation, Rich observed multiple peaks in terms of both ultraviolet absorption and radioactivity. He proposed that each successive peak corresponded to an additional ribosome in the cluster. This hypothesis was confirmed through electron microscopy.

## Explain the correlation between ultraviolet absorption/radioactivity and ribosome peaks as proposed by Rich.

Rich conducted an experiment that showed multiple peaks in ultraviolet absorption and radioactivity after centrifugation. He proposed that each peak corresponds to an increased number of ribosomes forming polyribosomes. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of these ribosome clusters.

## Summarize the advancements in the understanding of protein synthesis mechanisms from the mid-1950s to the discovery of polyribosomes.

In the mid-1950s, the understanding of protein synthesis was simple, considering one RNA-rich cytoplasmic component as the site of synthesis. A decade of research revealed a more complex structure with multiple components performing various functions in protein synthesis. This includes the discovery of polyribosomes, where multiple ribosomes simultaneously translate an mRNA molecule.

%

The translation process, as illustrated by the polyribosome schematic, involves multiple ribosomes attached to a single strand of messenger RNA (mRNA). Each ribosome translates the genetic information from the mRNA into a polypeptide chain (protein). The schematic shows the leftmost ribosome just beginning to form a polypeptide chain, while the rightmost ribosome has synthesized a significantly longer chain. This indicates the step-by-step elongation of polypeptide chains as the ribosomes move along the mRNA.

%

Ribosomes function as the molecular machines that facilitate the translation process by moving along the messenger RNA (mRNA), decoding its genetic information, and synthesizing polypeptide chains (proteins). The image shows a polyribosome with five ribosomes attached to the mRNA, each at different stages of forming a polypeptide chain, thereby demonstrating simultaneous, efficient protein synthesis.

%

Polyribosomes, or polysomes, are complexes of multiple ribosomes attached to a single strand of messenger RNA (mRNA). They facilitate the simultaneous synthesis of multiple polypeptide chains. In the provided image, the leftmost ribosome has just begun forming a polypeptide chain, whereas each subsequent ribosome, moving rightward, has produced progressively longer chains, culminating with the rightmost ribosome having formed the longest chain. This illustrates the translation process, where ribosomes translate genetic information from mRNA into sequences of amino acids to form proteins.

%

The rightmost ribosome signifies that it is in an advanced stage of the translation process, as it has produced a fairly long polypeptide chain. This indicates that it has been attached to the mRNA for a longer duration compared to the other ribosomes shown in the image.

## How did Colvin Redman, Siekevitz, and Palade (1966) demonstrate the transport of newly synthesized proteins?

Colvin Redman, Siekevitz, and Palade (1966) demonstrated the transport of newly synthesized proteins by utilizing $\mathrm{C}^{14}$ labeling in pancreatic microsomes from pigeons. They found that the labeled amylase appeared in the cisternal cavities of the microsome, indicating the movement of the synthesized proteins into these spaces.

- #biology.cell-biology, #biochemistry.protein-synthesis

## What was demonstrated by treating the ribosome with puromycin according to Redman and Sabatini (1966)?

Redman and Sabatini (1966) demonstrated that treating the ribosome with puromycin resulted in the appearance of labeled unfinished proteins in the cisternal cavities. This showed that "from the onset of protein synthesis the growing peptide chain is directed towards the cisternal space into which it diffuses upon its release from the attached ribosome."

- #biology.cell-biology, #biochemistry.protein-synthesis

## What role does the large ribosomal subunit play in the transport of newly formed proteins?

Earlier research by Sabatini et al. (1966) demonstrated that the large ribosomal subunit was directly attached to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. This led to the conclusion that the new protein was transported from the large subunit through the membrane to the cisternal space.

- #biology.cell-biology, #biochemistry.ribosome

## Why did Palade (1974) argue that the endoplasmic reticulum has a complex structure?

Palade (1974) argued that the complex structure of the endoplasmic reticulum can be explained by its role in the vectorial transport of newly formed proteins into the cisternal space. This structural feature is justified by the need to trap proteins produced for export. He noted that aside from $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ accumulation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle fibers, other functions of the endoplasmic reticulum did not directly necessitate a cavitary organ according to current knowledge.

## Discuss the early controversy surrounding the Golgi Apparatus.

In 1949, Claude and Palade challenged the existence of the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that it was an artifact of staining with osmium or other heavy metals.

Eventually, the controversy subsided, and it became widely accepted as a distinct cell organelle involved in various cellular activities. By 1981, Palade and Marilyn Farquhar stated that no one questioned its existence or relevance anymore.

- #cell-biology, #research-history


## Who were the major contributors to the Golgi apparatus' validation and what was their role?

Despite initially challenging its existence, Palade contributed much to the validation of the Golgi apparatus by providing crucial information about its function. Alongside Marilyn Farquhar, Palade wrote reviews affirming the significance and authenticity of the Golgi Apparatus.

- #cell-biology, #research-contributors


## What were the challenges in visualizing the Golgi apparatus during the early research period?

The Golgi apparatus was controversial because it was not visible in living cells, and its visualization relied on Golgi's heavy-metal staining method (la reazione nera), which was difficult to reproduce reliably and often stained many other structures.

- #cell-biology, #visualization-techniques

### What role did electron microscopy play in the study of the Golgi apparatus?

Electron microscopy, particularly the studies carried out by Albert Dalton, was crucial in revealing the detailed structure of the Golgi apparatus. Dalton's initial research showed a membranous network in cells where the Golgi apparatus was typically detected, undermining previous hypotheses regarding the Golgi's formation.

## Describe the structure of the Golgi apparatus as addressed by Dalton and Felix. Include details such as the three differentiated components, the arrangement in stacks, and the cis and trans sides.

The Golgi apparatus, as described by Dalton and Felix, comprises three main components: lamellae or flattened cisternal sacs, large vacuoles, and clusters of small vesicles. These flattened sacs, known as saccules, are typically found in stacks of three to seven in plant and animal tissues and in greater numbers in unicellular organisms. The sacs contribute to the traditional image of the Golgi apparatus in light microscopy.

- On one side, the cis side, the stacks abut the endoplasmic reticulum. Clusters of small vesicles are visible at this interface.
- On the other side, the trans side, larger vacuoles are found, often referred to as condensing vacuoles.

Additionally, Dalton coined the term "Golgi complex" to highlight the different components comprising the Golgi region. This structure is further revealed by electron microscopy and cell fractionation techniques.

- #cell-biology, #golgi-apparatus.structure


## Summarize the functional significance of the Golgi apparatus as discovered by Dalton and Felix.

Dalton and Felix provided evidence that the Golgi apparatus is involved in the storage of lipids after absorption. By comparing the images of the Golgi complex in mouse intestinal cells after fasting and forty minutes post-eating, they located the involvement of this organelle in lipid storage. 

Their work revealed that, as food intake affects the Golgi apparatus, it plays a critical role in cellular processes related to lipid metabolism.

- #cell-biology, #golgi-apparatus.function


## Describe the relation between secretory granules and the Golgi apparatus as per early electron micrograph studies.

Early electron micrographs, such as those by Farquhar and Rinehart (1954), revealed a close relationship between secretory granules and the Golgi apparatus. Subsequent micrographs indicated the presence of secretory granules within the Golgi structures, particularly in rat pituitary acidophils and mouse pancreatic acinar cells under increased secretory activity conditions. This suggested that granule formation might occur within the Golgi apparatus in these cell types.

This significant finding emphasizes the role of the Golgi apparatus in the secretory pathway of cells.

- #cell-biology, #golgi-apparatus.secretory-relationship


## Discuss the challenges faced in the biochemical analysis and fractionation of the Golgi apparatus as described in the paper.

Biochemical analysis of the Golgi apparatus involved separating it from other cell components through cell fractionation. Dalton, along with Felix (1954), established that the Golgi apparatus could be extracted from epididymis cells. Schneider and Kuff (1954) further separated the Golgi apparatus within epididymal homogenates by gradient centrifugation, demonstrating that the Golgi fraction contained high concentrations of phospholipid, acid and alkaline phosphatase, and RNA.

However, fractionating the Golgi apparatus posed significant challenges because its smooth lipoprotein membranes tended to break up and form smooth microsomes. This difficulty underscores the complexity and delicate nature of the Golgi apparatus compared to other organelles.

## Describe the procedure used by Palade and Siekevitz to trace the migration of $\alpha$-chymotrypsinogen.

Palade and Siekevitz used ${ }^{14}\mathrm{C}$-leucine as a tracer to establish the migration path of $\alpha$-chymotrypsinogen from the ribosome into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and ultimately into zymogen granules. The experiment provided critical evidence for the transport of this secretory protein through cell compartments.

- #cell-biology, #experimental-methods.protein-tracing

## How did Lucien Caro contribute to understanding protein transport using radioactive labeling?

Lucien Caro’s use of ${ }^{3} \mathrm{H}$-leucine, which appeared within three to five minutes of injection in the endoplasmic reticulum, and then after twenty to forty minutes in the condensing vacuoles on the trans side of the Golgi stack, was critical. This method demonstrated the transport path of proteins through the Golgi apparatus to zymogen granules within cells.

## Summarize the contribution of James Jamieson and Palade in characterizing the migration of membrane-bound vesicles using guinea pig tissue slices.

James Jamieson and Palade, through a series of studies beginning in 1966, used guinea pig tissue slices and a three-minute exposure to ${ }^{14}\mathrm{C}$-leucine ("labeling pulse"), followed by removal of the unincorporated label ("chase"). This enabled them to demonstrate the encapsulation of proteins in small peripheral vesicles on the cis side of the Golgi stack, their appearance in condensing vacuoles on the trans side, and ultimately their discharge from the cell.

- #cell-biology, #experimental-methods.golgi-apparatus

## What was a key methodological improvement introduced by Jamieson and Palade in their protein tracing experiments?

A key methodological improvement introduced by Jamieson and Palade was the use of a three-minute exposure to ${ }^{14}\mathrm{C}$-leucine (labeling pulse), followed by the removal of unincorporated label (chase). This approach provided much better time resolution of radioactive material within the cell, aiding the detailed characterization of protein migration.

$$

- #cell-biology, #experimental-methods.time-resolution

## How was it demonstrated that protein transport to the Golgi complex does not depend on new proteins entering the process?

In their experiments, Jamieson and Palade used cyclohexamide to block protein synthesis. They showed that even when protein synthesis was blocked, protein transport to the Golgi complex continued. This demonstrated that the transport process did not depend on the continued synthesis of new proteins entering the process.

- #cell-biology, #protein-transport

## Explain the energy requirements for protein transport as demonstrated by Jamieson and Palade.

Jamieson and Palade demonstrated that glycolytic inhibitors (fluoride, iodoacetate) did not block protein transport, while respiratory inhibitors (N2, cyanide, antimycin A) and inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation (dinitrophenol, oligomycin) did. This indicates that the energy required for protein transport comes from oxidative phosphorylation rather than glycolysis.

- #cell-biology, #protein-transport, #bioenergetics

## What are the two hypotheses proposed for the mechanism of protein connection between the RER cisternal space and that of the condensing vacuoles?

The two hypotheses proposed by Jamieson and Palade are:
1. Intermittent connections between the RER cisternal space and the condensing vacuoles.
2. Transport using small peripheral vesicles as shuttle carriers.
Both hypotheses imply repeated membrane fission-fusion events, which are considered to be the energy-requiring steps.

- #cell-biology, #protein-transport

## What model did P. P. Grassé propose regarding the function of the Golgi stack, and how does it differ from Palade's hypothesis?

P. P. Grassé proposed a maturational or cisternal progression model, suggesting that cisternae are continually created on the cis side of the stack, mature as they move to the trans side, and disintegrate to release their contents. This differs from Palade's hypothesis, which favors small peripheral vesicles serving as shuttle carriers where nascent proteins remain membrane-bound as they traverse the Golgi structure.

## What did Lehninger and Kennedy conclude about the mitochondrial role in the oxidation of fatty acids, and how do the mitochondrial and glycolytic pathways compartmentalize within the cell?

Lehninger and Kennedy concluded that mitochondria contain a complete set of enzymes required for the oxidation of fatty acids, sufficient to account for the known rates of oxidation within an intact cell. Furthermore, they discovered that glycolysis does not occur within mitochondria but rather in the aqueous cytosol of the cell, catalyzed by enzymes found in the supernatant.

- #biochemistry, #cell-biology.mitochondria

## According to Lehninger (1951), what must be added to a mitochondrial preparation to observe significant oxidative phosphorylation and why?

Lehninger (1951) found that adding DPNH (NADH) to a mitochondrial preparation in a hypotonic $\mathrm{KCl}$, sucrose, or distilled water medium facilitated its entry into mitochondria, which in turn allowed significant oxidative phosphorylation. This resulted in the production of approximately three ATP molecules per atom of oxygen consumed.

- #biochemistry, #oxidative-phosphorylation

## What conclusion did Kennedy and Lehninger draw about the autonomy of mitochondrial activities and their dependency on external factors?

Kennedy and Lehninger concluded that, although mitochondria are the major site of oxidative activities, they are not completely autonomous regarding their respiratory behavior. Metabolites such as malate, $\mathrm{MgSO}_{4}$, cytochrome $c, \mathrm{KCl}$, and ATP must be supplied to maintain these reactions, indicating a dependence on the cytoplasm for certain cofactors and metabolic interchange.

- #biochemistry, #cell-biology.mitochondria

## How did the initial studies of isolated mitochondria using $\mathrm{P}^{32}$ contribute to understanding ATP synthesis, and what limitation was discovered?

The initial studies using labeled $\mathrm{P}^{32}$ demonstrated that isolated mitochondria could synthesize ATP. However, the rate of ATP formation was very slow initially. It was discovered that DPNH (NADH) could not penetrate the mitochondrial body unless the mitochondrial preparation was placed in a hypotonic medium before restoring isotonicity, thereby facilitating significant oxidative phosphorylation.

## What question did Marian Neutra and Charles Leblond pose regarding the Golgi apparatus and its role in processing proteins?

Marian Neutra and Charles Leblond questioned the essential role of the Golgi apparatus in the processing of proteins, speculating that it might effect important chemical changes.

- #cell-biology, #golgi-apparatus, #protein-processing


## What was the main conclusion Neutra and Leblond reached about the Golgi apparatus and its role in glycoprotein formation?

Neutra and Leblond concluded that the Golgi apparatus synthesizes glycoproteins by combining glucose or galactose precursors with proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum.

## Describe the structure and function of the goblet cell as studied by Leblond. Mention the stages and regions of the Golgi apparatus as defined in the studies.

Leblond's studies on goblet cells described them as long, narrow structures with several Golgi stacks, where the cis saccules were flattened and the trans saccules were bulging with material. Glucose tracers moved from the cisternae to the cisterna, where they were converted into mucigen granules.

- #cell-biology, #golgi-apparatus, #goblet-cells


## Why did the recognition of the Golgi apparatus' significance change in the 1960s, and what technological advances contributed to this shift?

In the 1960s, the Golgi apparatus was recognized as a major cellular component due to better imaging from electron microscopes and evidence of its functional role in creating secretion products.

## What method did Christian de Duve initially employ to isolate glucose-6-phosphatase, and what was the observed issue with the enzyme in acid solution?

Christian de Duve initially employed differential centrifugation to isolate glucose-6-phosphatase. He observed that when glucose-6-phosphatase was precipitated in an acid solution, it could not be redissolved when the pH level was raised. This suggested to de Duve that agglutination, not precipitation, was occurring, indicating that the enzyme was attached to a structure.

- #biochemistry, #enzymology.cell-fractionation

## Which collaboration helped Christian de Duve further his research on glucose metabolism, and what discovery arose during this collaboration?

Christian de Duve collaborated with Carl and Gerty Cori at Washington University. During this collaboration, it was discovered that glucagon, not insulin, was the responsible agent for certain actions previously ascribed to insulin. This discovery arose during de Duve's collaboration with postdoctoral fellow Earl Sutherland, who later won a Nobel Prize for the discovery of cyclic AMP.

## What was the primary function of the lysosome that led to its identification, and how did this differ from the identification processes of other organelles?

The primary function of the lysosome that led to its identification was its role in enzymatic activity, specifically in degrading cellular components. This process of identification through function differed from other organelles, which were typically identified based on morphological observations before their biochemical functions were studied.

- #cell-biology, #lysosome.identification-process

## Describe the transition Christian de Duve made in his experimental technique for isolating glucose-6-phosphatase. What did he achieve using cell fractionation instead of the Waring blender?

Christian de Duve transitioned from using the Waring blender to cell fractionation as a gentler method for isolating glucose-6-phosphatase. Using cell fractionation, he localized 95% of the enzyme's activity in the microsomal fraction, which was a significant improvement in isolating the enzyme without causing further agglutination.

- #biochemistry, #experimental-techniques.cell-fractionation

## According to the chunk of the paper provided, what evidence led de Duve to conclude that acid phosphatase activity was initially masked and activated over time?

De Duve stored fractions in a refrigerator and observed that, after five days, the acid phosphatase activity increased by an order of magnitude, suggesting that the enzyme activity was initially masked and only activated over time.

- #biochemistry, #enzyme-activity.latency

## What hypothesis did de Duve propose about the containment and activation of acid phosphatase in fractionated cells?

De Duve hypothesized that acid phosphatase was contained within a separate "baglike" particle upon initial fractionation, which limited its access to the substrate. This explains why the enzyme activity became measurable only after being released either by rough treatment or by aging.

- #biochemistry, #cell-fractionation.containment

## What was the significant finding when de Duve continued fractionating cells and segregated a light fraction containing acid phosphatase and a heavy fraction containing cytochrome oxidase?

De Duve found that the light fraction containing acid phosphatase exhibited enzymatic activity while the heavy fraction containing cytochrome oxidase did not. This differentiation was crucial in understanding that acid phosphatase was not housed in the mitochondrion, but likely in a different cellular compartment.

- #biochemistry, #cell-fractionation.results

## What discovery did de Duve make at the Second International Congress of Biochemistry in 1952 regarding $\beta$-glucuronidase, and how did it influence his further research?

De Duve discovered that his light fraction, which contained acid phosphatase, also contained $\beta$-glucuronidase after a British biochemist, P.G. Walker, suggested similar findings. This led de Duve to investigate other enzymes, confirming the presence of several other hydrolases in his light fraction.

## What is the general formula followed by the hydrolytic reactions that lysosome-associated enzymes carry out? Provide context from the text.

The general formula for the hydrolytic reaction carried out by lysosome-associated enzymes is:

$$

$$

This formula represents the enzymatic degradation of a macromolecule into its subunits by the addition of water.

## What was the enzymatic composition of lysosomes as identified by the early 1960s according to Novikoff, 1961?

By the early 1960s, lysosomes were associated with twelve enzymes, each capable of splitting significant biological compounds in a slightly acidic environment. These enzymes included:

- Acid phosphatase
- Cathepsin A and B
- Acid desoxyribonuclease
- Acid ribonuclease
- $\beta$-glucuronidase

## What additional organelle was identified by de Duve through his enzyme distribution studies separate from lysosomes? Describe its associated enzymatic functions.

De Duve identified the peroxisome as an additional organelle separate from lysosomes. The peroxisome was associated with the segregation of urate oxidase and three additional enzymes—two involved in the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (d-amino acid oxidase and $\alpha$-hydroxyl acid oxidase) and one involved in its breakdown (catalase).

## Describe the significance of the electron micrograph of the lysosome fraction from rat liver and explain the labels in Figure 6.15.

The electron micrograph illustrates the cellular structures within a rat liver lysosome fraction. The dense bodies indicated by arrows are lysosomes, which are crucial for intracellular digestion. The ER label designates microsomal membranes likely from the endoplasmic reticulum, while the granules within these membranes are smaller than the lysosomes. The MT label indicates a mitochondrion, although it is noted to be poorly preserved in this instance.

- #biology, #cell-biology.organelle-identification, #microscopy

## Explain why the microsomal membranes labeled as ER in Figure 6.15 are presumed to be from the endoplasmic reticulum.

The microsomal membranes are presumed to be from the endoplasmic reticulum because they resemble known structures of the ER observed in other electron micrographs. The granules within these membranes, which are much smaller than the lysosomes, further support this identification due to their typical association with the ER.

## What are the functions of lysosomes in cellular metabolism as seen in the electron micrograph of the lysosome fraction from rat liver?

Lysosomes function in cellular metabolism by breaking down waste materials and cellular debris via hydrolytic enzymes. They play a crucial role in digesting macromolecules, recycling cellular components, and responding to cellular stress. The dense bodies indicated by arrows in the electron micrograph represent these lysosomes, emphasizing their significance in intracellular digestion.

## Describe the connection drawn by Werner Straus between lysosomes and the digestion of materials within the cell.

Straus identified droplets in the proximal tubule of the kidney, noting their high concentration of acid phosphatase. He later confirmed the presence of other enzymes associated with lysosomes in these droplets, linking lysosomes to the digestion of both extracellular materials and intracellular breakdown products.

## Explain de Duve's hypothesis regarding the involvement of lysosomes in processes of acid hydrolysis.

De Duve hypothesized that lysosomes are involved in various processes of acid hydrolysis, including the digestion of foreign material through pathways such as pinocytosis, phagocytosis, and autolysis (both physiological and pathological).

- #cell-biology.acid-hydrolysis, #cellular-digestion

## Why did the initial variability in lysosome shape and size cause difficulty in identifying lysosomes in other cells?

The initial variability in lysosome shape and size made it difficult to generalize the lysosome concept. De Duve was reluctant to generalize until the role of lysosomes in cellular digestion was understood, as this variability explained the diverse substances and objects in varying states of disintegration found within lysosomes.

## What are the three phases involved in both heterophagy and autophagy according to Figure 6.16?

The three phases in both heterophagy and autophagy are:

1. **Formation of Pre-lysosomes**: Incorporation of endocytic vesicles or old cell parts into phagosomes or autophagic vesicles.
2. **Formation of Secondary Lysosomes**: Merging of pre-lysosomes with primary lysosomes containing hydrolases.
3. **Formation of Residual Bodies**: Packaging of undigested material into residual bodies.

## What symbolic representation is used to denote hydrolases in Figure 6.16 and what is their role in lysosomal function?

Hydrolases are symbolized by crosses (✕) in Figure 6.16. Their role in lysosomal function is to digest the material within the lysosome.

- #biology, #cell-biology.lysosome

## Explain the process of forming a secondary lysosome as depicted in the schematic representation by de Duve and Wattriaux (1966).

The process of forming a secondary lysosome involves merging pre-lysosomes with primary lysosomes. Pre-lysosomes originate from either endocytic vesicles (heterophagy) or autophagic vesicles (autophagy), and primary lysosomes contain hydrolases. Upon merging, the hydrolases from primary lysosomes help in digesting the material inside the vesicle, forming a secondary lysosome.

## Describe the final phase of lysosomal digestion depicted in Figure 6.16 by de Duve and Wattriaux (1966).

The final phase of lysosomal digestion depicted in Figure 6.16 is the formation of residual bodies. This phase involves the packaging of undigested material into residual bodies, which are eventually expelled out of the cell.

%

The schematic representation by de Duve and Wattriaux (1966) illustrates the lysosomal system involved in eliminating cellular waste products through two main processes: heterophagy and autophagy. 

- **Heterophagy**: Material entering the cell from outside is incorporated into endocytic vesicles, forming phagosomes.
- **Autophagy**: Old cell parts are incorporated into autophagic vesicles.
Both processes involve three phases: 
1. Formation of pre-lysosomes from endocytic vesicles or cellular parts.
2. Fusion with primary lysosomes containing acid hydrolases to form secondary lysosomes.
3. Digestion of material within secondary lysosomes. 

Residual bodies form undigested materials, which can undergo mixed excretion, defecation, or secretion.

The main phases in the lysosomal system are:

1. **Pre-lysosome Formation**:
   - For heterophagy: Endocytic vesicles form phagosomes.
   - For autophagy: Old cell parts form autophagic vesicles.
2. **Primary Lysosome Fusion**:
   - Pre-lysosomes fuse with primary lysosomes containing acid hydrolases.
3. **Secondary Lysosome Formation and Digestion**:
   - The fusion results in secondary lysosomes where digestion and absorption occur. 
4. **Residual Bodies**:
   - Undigested materials are packaged into residual bodies which can undergo mixed excretion, defecation, or secretion.

The illustration by de Duve and Wattriaux (1966) presents a schematic representation of the lysosomal system for eliminating cellular waste products. It depicts two main pathways, heterophagy (material entering the cell from without) and autophagy (material from within the cell), both having three phases. The left side shows "pre-lysosomes," including endocytic vesicles and autophagic vesicles. These merge with primary lysosomes containing acid hydrolases to form secondary lysosomes, where digestion and absorption occur. Undigested material is then packaged into "residual bodies" that can undergo excretion, defecation, and secretion.

In heterophagy and autophagy, the structures involved include:

1. Pre-lysosomes: Endocytic vesicles or old cell parts in autophagic vesicles.
2. Primary lysosomes: Contain acid hydrolases.
3. Secondary lysosomes: Formed by merging with primary lysosomes where digestion and absorption occur.
4. Residual bodies: Contain undigested material packaged for excretion, defecation, or secretion.

Arrows in the schematic indicate the process directions such as endocytosis, regurgitation, diffusion, and secretion.

## How did de Duve contribute to our understanding of the lysosomal system in the 1960s?

De Duve presented parallel versions of the mechanism for the digestion of material entering the cell from without (heterophagy) and from within (autophagy). He proposed that material to be digested by lysosomal enzymes was first entrapped into a phagosome, which then fused with the primary lysosome to create a digestive vacuole or secondary lysosome. Some digestion products diffused back into the cytoplasm, while resistant materials built up, forming a residual body.

- #cell-biology, #lysosomal-system.contribution

## Define the processes of heterophagy and autophagy as described by de Duve.

Heterophagy involves the digestion of material entering the cell from the outside, while autophagy involves digestion from within the cell. In heterophagy, material is entrapped in a phagosome, which fuses with the primary lysosome to form a secondary lysosome. In autophagy, the digestive vacuole is known as an autophagic vacuole, operated on similarly to phagosomes.

## What staining technique did de Duve develop to visualize lysosomes and associated structures? What was the key feature of the resulting micrographs?

De Duve developed a technique for staining acid phosphatase activity using lead to generate an insoluble compound with high electron scattering potential. This technique produced dark images in the micrographs, enabling visualization of the lysosome, digestive vacuole, autophagic vacuole, and residual body.

## What is GERL, and how did Novikoff's research contribute to our understanding of lysosome formation?

GERL stands for a Golgi-related region of smooth endoplasmic reticulum from which lysosomes appear to develop. Novikoff and colleagues found hydrolases in some cisternae of the trans Golgi region and adjacent smooth endoplasmic reticulum. They advanced the idea that hydrolases bypass the Golgi stack and are transported directly to the most distal Golgi area for incorporation into primary lysosomes.

## How did the efforts from the 1940s and 1950s contribute to our understanding of the mitochondrion's function within the cell?

The efforts begun in the 1940s and 1950s led to the realization that the mitochondrion, often referred to as the power plant of the cell, required a membrane component for its enzyme systems responsible for cellular respiration. This understanding was crucial in recognizing how the membrane played a pivotal role in the actual functioning of the mitochondrion.

## What was one major conclusion about the role of membranes in the function of the endoplasmic reticulum during the 1950s and 1960s?

Researchers concluded that membranes in the endoplasmic reticulum help structure environments for newly synthesized proteins that are destined for export. This role was significant in understanding how the ribosomes and other RNA constituents operate within the endoplasmic reticulum to synthesize proteins.

## Explain the role of lysosomes in the context of cellular maintenance and digestion.

The discovery of the lysosome as an organelle rich in hydrolytic enzymes was essential for understanding how cells digest foreign substances and worn-out cell components. This knowledge provided the basis for the overall mechanism of cellular maintenance involving digestion and recycling of cellular materials.

## Describe the primary mechanisms of aerobic respiration that the cyclophorase system carries out.

The cyclophorase system carries out several key mechanisms of aerobic respiration: fatty acid oxidation, the citric acid cycle, the respiratory chain, and oxidative phosphorylation. This system is composed of a single, physically structured group of enzymes that facilitate these metabolic processes.

- #biochemistry, #aerobic-respiration

## What evidence did Green provide to support the existence of the cyclophorase system?

Green's primary evidence was his failure to isolate the enzyme catalyzing pyruvic to acetic acid using cell fractionation techniques. His preparation from rabbit kidney metabolized pyruvic acid all the way to carbon dioxide and water without isolating individual enzymes, suggesting a structured system of enzymes working together.

- #biochemistry, #experimental-evidence

## What is the significance of the term "cyclophorase" in Green's conceptualization?

Green used the term "cyclophorase" to refer to a system of enzymes involved in the citric acid cycle. He explained that it literally means the system of enzymes carrying through the citric acid cycle. This term underscores the cooperative action and physical arrangement of enzymes that facilitate aerobic respiration.

- #biochemistry, #enzyme-systems

## What was the discrepancy between Green's initial claims and Lehninger's work, and how did it affect Green's view of the cyclophorase system?

Initially, Green claimed that the cyclophorase system was a newly discovered constituent of the cell. However, after learning of Lehninger's work, Green had to be convinced that his cyclophorase system was linked to the mitochondrion. This new understanding influenced his acceptance of the system's association with mitochondrial functions.

- #biochemistry, #cellular-respiration, #mitochondria
  


## What did Green propose regarding the relationship between coenzymes and apoenzymes in the cyclophorase system?

Green proposed that a coenzyme was bound as a prosthetic group to the protein component of an enzyme, which he referred to as the apoenzyme. This formation requires only one coenzyme molecule per enzyme molecule, enhancing efficiency.

- #biochemistry, #enzyme-mechanisms.coenzymes

## What problem did Green note about the binding of pyridinenucleotide in the cyclophorase system?

Green noted that when pyridinenucleotide is bound in the cyclophorase system, its shuttle capability between oxidized and reduced forms is severely limited, posing a challenge for its interaction with a variety of systems.

- #biochemistry, #enzyme-mechanisms.pyridinenucleotide

## What was an important aspect of Green's conception of the cyclophorase system?

An important aspect of Green's conception was that the cyclophorase system not only links together the enzymes but also binds them to the coenzymes that figured in the reactions, crucially contributing to the efficiency of the metabolic process.

- #biochemistry, #enzyme-mechanisms.cyclophorase-system

## How did biochemists in the 1950s view Green's cyclophorase proposal?

Most biochemists rejected Green's cyclophorase proposal as an excessively speculative response to the difficulty of rendering the enzymes of oxidative metabolism soluble and isolating them.
