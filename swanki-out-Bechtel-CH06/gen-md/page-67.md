## How did de Duve contribute to our understanding of the lysosomal system in the 1960s?

De Duve presented parallel versions of the mechanism for the digestion of material entering the cell from without (heterophagy) and from within (autophagy). He proposed that material to be digested by lysosomal enzymes was first entrapped into a phagosome, which then fused with the primary lysosome to create a digestive vacuole or secondary lysosome. Some digestion products diffused back into the cytoplasm, while resistant materials built up, forming a residual body.

## Define the processes of heterophagy and autophagy as described by de Duve.

Heterophagy involves the digestion of material entering the cell from the outside, while autophagy involves digestion from within the cell. In heterophagy, material is entrapped in a phagosome, which fuses with the primary lysosome to form a secondary lysosome. In autophagy, the digestive vacuole is known as an autophagic vacuole, operated on similarly to phagosomes.

## What staining technique did de Duve develop to visualize lysosomes and associated structures? What was the key feature of the resulting micrographs?

De Duve developed a technique for staining acid phosphatase activity using lead to generate an insoluble compound with high electron scattering potential. This technique produced dark images in the micrographs, enabling visualization of the lysosome, digestive vacuole, autophagic vacuole, and residual body.

## What is GERL, and how did Novikoff's research contribute to our understanding of lysosome formation?

GERL stands for a Golgi-related region of smooth endoplasmic reticulum from which lysosomes appear to develop. Novikoff and colleagues found hydrolases in some cisternae of the trans Golgi region and adjacent smooth endoplasmic reticulum. They advanced the idea that hydrolases bypass the Golgi stack and are transported directly to the most distal Golgi area for incorporation into primary lysosomes.
