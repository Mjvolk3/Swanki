## What were the initial criteria used by Novikoff to identify lysosomes?

Novikoff identified lysosomes using the presence of a membrane and the positive indication of acid phosphatase as evidence. These criteria were important in distinguishing lysosomes from other cellular components.

## Describe the connection drawn by Werner Straus between lysosomes and the digestion of materials within the cell.

Straus identified droplets in the proximal tubule of the kidney, noting their high concentration of acid phosphatase. He later confirmed the presence of other enzymes associated with lysosomes in these droplets, linking lysosomes to the digestion of both extracellular materials and intracellular breakdown products.

## Explain de Duve's hypothesis regarding the involvement of lysosomes in processes of acid hydrolysis.

De Duve hypothesized that lysosomes are involved in various processes of acid hydrolysis, including the digestion of foreign material through pathways such as pinocytosis, phagocytosis, and autolysis (both physiological and pathological).

## Why did the initial variability in lysosome shape and size cause difficulty in identifying lysosomes in other cells?

The initial variability in lysosome shape and size made it difficult to generalize the lysosome concept. De Duve was reluctant to generalize until the role of lysosomes in cellular digestion was understood, as this variability explained the diverse substances and objects in varying states of disintegration found within lysosomes.
