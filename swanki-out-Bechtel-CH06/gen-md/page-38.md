## What did Palade note about the difficulties of interpreting thin sections of the endoplasmic reticulum?

The usual thickness of such sections, 20 to $40 \mu \mathrm{m}$, being much smaller than the mesh size of the reticulum, and even smaller than the diameter of the vesicles and tubules that form its trabeculae, leads to only slices of these trabeculae or "profiles" being found. Fragments of meshes, or more or less complete meshes, are only occasionally encountered, and the continuity of the system throughout the cytoplasm is never apparent. This continuity can only be regained by the difficult and tedious operation of tridimensional reconstruction.

## Why was the use of spread cells as initial specimens for the study of the endoplasmic reticulum considered fortunate?

The main feature of the endoplasmic reticulum system, i.e., its disposition in a continuous reticulum that permeates the entire cytoplasm, would have been extremely difficult, if not impossible, to grasp from the exclusive study of thin sections. Spread cells provide a more continuous and comprehensible view of the reticulum.

## What happens to the continuity of the endoplasmic reticulum system in thin sections, and how can it be regained?

The continuity of the endoplasmic reticulum system is lost by microtomy in thin sections and can only be regained by the difficult and tedious operation of tridimensional reconstruction.

## What were the conflicting descriptions and names caused by the shift from spread to sectioned specimens?

The shift from spread to sectioned specimens caused a number of conflicting descriptions and interpretations of the endoplasmic reticulum system. Various names were proposed for structures belonging to the system under consideration, leading to confusion and terminological disagreements.
