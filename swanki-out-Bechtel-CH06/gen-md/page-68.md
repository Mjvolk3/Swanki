## How did the efforts from the 1940s and 1950s contribute to our understanding of the mitochondrion's function within the cell?

The efforts begun in the 1940s and 1950s led to the realization that the mitochondrion, often referred to as the power plant of the cell, required a membrane component for its enzyme systems responsible for cellular respiration. This understanding was crucial in recognizing how the membrane played a pivotal role in the actual functioning of the mitochondrion.

## What was one major conclusion about the role of membranes in the function of the endoplasmic reticulum during the 1950s and 1960s?

Researchers concluded that membranes in the endoplasmic reticulum help structure environments for newly synthesized proteins that are destined for export. This role was significant in understanding how the ribosomes and other RNA constituents operate within the endoplasmic reticulum to synthesize proteins.

## {{c1::What organelle's function became well-established during the 1950s and 1960s due to new findings about protein preparation for export?}}

## Investigators discovered the importance of the Golgi apparatus in the process of migrating proteins from the rough endoplasmic reticulum through the smooth endoplasmic reticulum into the secretory vesicles. This confirmed the Golgi apparatus's crucial role in preparing proteins for export.

## Explain the role of lysosomes in the context of cellular maintenance and digestion.

The discovery of the lysosome as an organelle rich in hydrolytic enzymes was essential for understanding how cells digest foreign substances and worn-out cell components. This knowledge provided the basis for the overall mechanism of cellular maintenance involving digestion and recycling of cellular materials.
