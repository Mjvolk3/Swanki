## What did Lehninger and Kennedy conclude about the mitochondrial role in the oxidation of fatty acids, and how do the mitochondrial and glycolytic pathways compartmentalize within the cell?

Lehninger and Kennedy concluded that mitochondria contain a complete set of enzymes required for the oxidation of fatty acids, sufficient to account for the known rates of oxidation within an intact cell. Furthermore, they discovered that glycolysis does not occur within mitochondria but rather in the aqueous cytosol of the cell, catalyzed by enzymes found in the supernatant.

## According to Lehninger (1951), what must be added to a mitochondrial preparation to observe significant oxidative phosphorylation and why?

Lehninger (1951) found that adding DPNH (NADH) to a mitochondrial preparation in a hypotonic $\mathrm{KCl}$, sucrose, or distilled water medium facilitated its entry into mitochondria, which in turn allowed significant oxidative phosphorylation. This resulted in the production of approximately three ATP molecules per atom of oxygen consumed.

## What conclusion did Kennedy and Lehninger draw about the autonomy of mitochondrial activities and their dependency on external factors?

Kennedy and Lehninger concluded that, although mitochondria are the major site of oxidative activities, they are not completely autonomous regarding their respiratory behavior. Metabolites such as malate, $\mathrm{MgSO}_{4}$, cytochrome $c, \mathrm{KCl}$, and ATP must be supplied to maintain these reactions, indicating a dependence on the cytoplasm for certain cofactors and metabolic interchange.

## How did the initial studies of isolated mitochondria using $\mathrm{P}^{32}$ contribute to understanding ATP synthesis, and what limitation was discovered?

The initial studies using labeled $\mathrm{P}^{32}$ demonstrated that isolated mitochondria could synthesize ATP. However, the rate of ATP formation was very slow initially. It was discovered that DPNH (NADH) could not penetrate the mitochondrial body unless the mitochondrial preparation was placed in a hypotonic medium before restoring isotonicity, thereby facilitating significant oxidative phosphorylation.
