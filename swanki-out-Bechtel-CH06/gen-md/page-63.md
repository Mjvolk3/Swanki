## What is the general formula followed by the hydrolytic reactions that lysosome-associated enzymes carry out? Provide context from the text.

The general formula for the hydrolytic reaction carried out by lysosome-associated enzymes is:

$$
\mathrm{AB}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{AH}+\mathrm{BOH}
$$

This formula represents the enzymatic degradation of a macromolecule into its subunits by the addition of water.

## What was the enzymatic composition of lysosomes as identified by the early 1960s according to Novikoff, 1961?

By the early 1960s, lysosomes were associated with twelve enzymes, each capable of splitting significant biological compounds in a slightly acidic environment. These enzymes included:

- Acid phosphatase
- Cathepsin A and B
- Acid desoxyribonuclease
- Acid ribonuclease
- $\beta$-glucuronidase
- Aryl sulfatase A and B
- Phosphoprotein phosphatase
- $\beta$-galactosidase
- $\beta$-N-acetylglucosamidase
- $\alpha$-mannosidase

## Cloze card to test on the inhibitors and the acids that do not fractionate with the lysosomal enzymes

{{c1::Cytochrome $c$ reductases}} and {{c1::fumarase}} did not fractionate with lysosomal enzymes such as acid ribonuclease, acid deoxyribonuclease, cathepsin, acid phosphatase, and $\beta$-glucuronidase.

## What additional organelle was identified by de Duve through his enzyme distribution studies separate from lysosomes? Describe its associated enzymatic functions.

De Duve identified the peroxisome as an additional organelle separate from lysosomes. The peroxisome was associated with the segregation of urate oxidase and three additional enzymesâ€”two involved in the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (d-amino acid oxidase and $\alpha$-hydroxyl acid oxidase) and one involved in its breakdown (catalase).

$$
\text{Urate oxidase + Hydrogen peroxide synthesizing enzymes + Catalase}
