## What was the limitation of the term "endoplasmic reticulum" as discussed by Porter in 1953?

The term "endoplasmic reticulum" is considered vague and almost indicates anything in the ground substance of the cytoplasm. This diffuse classification does not help in systematizing the structural components of protoplasm.

## Who were the pioneers that demonstrated the highest concentration of labeled amino acids appeared in the microsome fraction?

In 1950, Harry Borsook of the California Institute of Technology and Tore J. M. Hultin of the Wenner-Gren Institute in Stockholm independently showed that the highest concentration of labeled amino acids appeared in the microsome fraction when labeled tissue cells were broken and fractionated.

## What role did Paul Zamecnik play in the biochemical studies of protein synthesis?

Paul Zamecnik at the Huntington Laboratory of Massachusetts General Hospital played a significant role in biochemical studies of protein synthesis. He worked in a landscape dominated by two main ideas: Max Bergmann's proposal of cathepsin enzymes catalyzing peptide bonds and Fritz Lipmann's idea of a phosphorylated intermediate causing peptide bonds.

## What was the fundamental strategy used to study protein synthesis and the formation of peptide bonds?

The strategy to study protein synthesis involved tracing the uptake of radioactively labeled amino acids into protein to identify the fraction in which it appeared. This methodology aimed to observe the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids to form polypeptide chains.
