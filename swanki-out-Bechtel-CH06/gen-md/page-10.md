## What technological advances enabled Palade's discovery of cristae in mitochondria?

Palade's discovery of the cristae structure within mitochondria was facilitated by two significant advancements: the development of a new buffered osmium fixative and the invention of Porter's new microtome, which allowed for very thin slicing of samples.

## What are "cristae" as described by Palade in his 1952 study?

In his 1952 study, Palade described cristae as "a system of parallel, regularly spaced ridges that protrude from the inside surface of the membrane towards the interior" of the mitochondrion. These structures were observed using improved electron microscopy techniques.

## What earlier findings did Palade build upon to substantiate the existence of the mitochondrial membrane?

Palade built upon earlier findings based on electron microscopy of isolated mitochondria and biochemical data regarding the retention of soluble chemical compounds within mitochondria. However, the existence of a mitochondrial membrane was also contested by some other researchers at the time (Harman, 1950b; Huennekens & Green, 1950).

## What methodological approach did Palade use in his comparative investigation that led to the discovery of the cristae?

Palade's methodological approach in his comparative investigation included using a new buffered osmium fixative and Porter's microtome to cut thin slices of cellular material. This meticulous approach allowed him to observe the parallel, regularly spaced ridges now known as cristae inside mitochondria under an electron microscope.
