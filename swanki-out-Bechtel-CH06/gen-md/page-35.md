## What did Porter and Blum discover about the nature of the elongated elements in the cytoplasm based on their micrographs of thin sections?

Porter and Blum discovered that the 'elongated elements' in the cytoplasm had a relatively 'transparent' center, bounded by a single dense line representing a membrane. They identified these elements as part of the endoplasmic reticulum.

## What was Dalton's conclusion about the form of the ergastoplasmic structures, and what evidence did he provide to support this?

Dalton concluded that the ergastoplasmic structures were lamellae rather than filaments or tubules. He provided evidence from electron microscope observations that these components stayed in focus while the focus of the electron microscope was changed, indicating a lamellar form.

## According to Porter and Blum, what were the limitations of micrographs of thin sliced cells in studying the endoplasmic reticulum?

Porter and Blum noted that micrographs of thin sliced cells lacked a three-dimensional perspective, making it difficult to fully understand the form and structure of the endoplasmic reticulum. They emphasized the importance of serial sections to obtain three-dimensional views.

## What specific observations did Porter and Blum make about the endoplasmic reticulum in their serial sections study?

Porter and Blum observed that the endoplasmic reticulum is a complex system of interconnected strands and sinusoids. These structures tended to be flattened in one dimension but were otherwise polymorphic.
