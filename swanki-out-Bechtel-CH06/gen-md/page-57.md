## Describe the structure of the Golgi apparatus as addressed by Dalton and Felix. Include details such as the three differentiated components, the arrangement in stacks, and the cis and trans sides.

The Golgi apparatus, as described by Dalton and Felix, comprises three main components: lamellae or flattened cisternal sacs, large vacuoles, and clusters of small vesicles. These flattened sacs, known as saccules, are typically found in stacks of three to seven in plant and animal tissues and in greater numbers in unicellular organisms. The sacs contribute to the traditional image of the Golgi apparatus in light microscopy.

- On one side, the cis side, the stacks abut the endoplasmic reticulum. Clusters of small vesicles are visible at this interface.
- On the other side, the trans side, larger vacuoles are found, often referred to as condensing vacuoles.

Additionally, Dalton coined the term "Golgi complex" to highlight the different components comprising the Golgi region. This structure is further revealed by electron microscopy and cell fractionation techniques.

## Summarize the functional significance of the Golgi apparatus as discovered by Dalton and Felix.

Dalton and Felix provided evidence that the Golgi apparatus is involved in the storage of lipids after absorption. By comparing the images of the Golgi complex in mouse intestinal cells after fasting and forty minutes post-eating, they located the involvement of this organelle in lipid storage. 

Their work revealed that, as food intake affects the Golgi apparatus, it plays a critical role in cellular processes related to lipid metabolism.

## Describe the relation between secretory granules and the Golgi apparatus as per early electron micrograph studies.

Early electron micrographs, such as those by Farquhar and Rinehart (1954), revealed a close relationship between secretory granules and the Golgi apparatus. Subsequent micrographs indicated the presence of secretory granules within the Golgi structures, particularly in rat pituitary acidophils and mouse pancreatic acinar cells under increased secretory activity conditions. This suggested that granule formation might occur within the Golgi apparatus in these cell types.

This significant finding emphasizes the role of the Golgi apparatus in the secretory pathway of cells.

## Discuss the challenges faced in the biochemical analysis and fractionation of the Golgi apparatus as described in the paper.

Biochemical analysis of the Golgi apparatus involved separating it from other cell components through cell fractionation. Dalton, along with Felix (1954), established that the Golgi apparatus could be extracted from epididymis cells. Schneider and Kuff (1954) further separated the Golgi apparatus within epididymal homogenates by gradient centrifugation, demonstrating that the Golgi fraction contained high concentrations of phospholipid, acid and alkaline phosphatase, and RNA.

However, fractionating the Golgi apparatus posed significant challenges because its smooth lipoprotein membranes tended to break up and form smooth microsomes. This difficulty underscores the complexity and delicate nature of the Golgi apparatus compared to other organelles.
