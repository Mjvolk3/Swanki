## Describe the significance of the peaks observed by Rich after using a homogenizer and centrifugation.

By using a homogenizer before centrifugation, Rich observed multiple peaks in terms of both ultraviolet absorption and radioactivity. He proposed that each successive peak corresponded to an additional ribosome in the cluster. This hypothesis was confirmed through electron microscopy.

## Explain the correlation between ultraviolet absorption/radioactivity and ribosome peaks as proposed by Rich.

Rich conducted an experiment that showed multiple peaks in ultraviolet absorption and radioactivity after centrifugation. He proposed that each peak corresponds to an increased number of ribosomes forming polyribosomes. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of these ribosome clusters.

## Rich's use of electron microscopy to confirm his hypothesis about ribosome clusters: Describe the methodology.

Rich's methodology involved two main steps. First, he used centrifugation to separate ribosome clusters, observing peaks in ultraviolet absorption and radioactivity. He then collaborated with Cyril Hall to use electron microscopy on the fractions, confirming the presence of ribosome clusters.

## Summarize the advancements in the understanding of protein synthesis mechanisms from the mid-1950s to the discovery of polyribosomes.

In the mid-1950s, the understanding of protein synthesis was simple, considering one RNA-rich cytoplasmic component as the site of synthesis. A decade of research revealed a more complex structure with multiple components performing various functions in protein synthesis. This includes the discovery of polyribosomes, where multiple ribosomes simultaneously translate an mRNA molecule.
