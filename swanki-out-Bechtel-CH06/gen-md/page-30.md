## How did Racker's research contribute to our understanding of oxidative phosphorylation?

Racker's research localized the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the ATPase in the spheres attached to the membrane. This provided a structural basis for biochemists to understand how the oxidation-reduction reactions of electron transport might be linked to ATP synthesis.

## What problem were biochemists still facing even after localization of the electron transport chain and ATPase?

Biochemists were still seeking chemical intermediates that linked the oxidation-reduction reactions of electron transport to ATP synthesis. In Slater's scheme, a hypothetical compound C was thought to form a high-energy bond with the substrate and transfer that bond to ADP. In Lehninger's model, enzymes X, Y, and Z played a role at the three phosphorylation sites along the electron transport chain.

## What was Peter Mitchell's revolutionary concept regarding oxidative phosphorylation?

In 1961, Peter Mitchell proposed that the crucial intermediary in oxidative phosphorylation was a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, not a chemical compound. He suggested that as respiratory substrates were oxidized by the electron transport chain, protons ($\mathrm{H}^{+}$) were discharged on one side of the membrane and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ ions on the other. This proton gradient bearing an electrical potential was key in driving the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate.

## How does the proton gradient described by Peter Mitchell link to ATP synthesis?

The proton gradient results in a higher concentration of protons in the intermembrane space of the cristae than in the mitochondrial matrix. This gradient provides the energy needed for ATPase to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate when operating in reverse, rather than breaking it down.
