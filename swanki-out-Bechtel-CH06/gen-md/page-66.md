## What are the three phases involved in both heterophagy and autophagy according to Figure 6.16?

The three phases in both heterophagy and autophagy are:

1. **Formation of Pre-lysosomes**: Incorporation of endocytic vesicles or old cell parts into phagosomes or autophagic vesicles.
2. **Formation of Secondary Lysosomes**: Merging of pre-lysosomes with primary lysosomes containing hydrolases.
3. **Formation of Residual Bodies**: Packaging of undigested material into residual bodies.

## What symbolic representation is used to denote hydrolases in Figure 6.16 and what is their role in lysosomal function?

Hydrolases are symbolized by crosses (âœ•) in Figure 6.16. Their role in lysosomal function is to digest the material within the lysosome.

## Explain the process of forming a secondary lysosome as depicted in the schematic representation by de Duve and Wattriaux (1966).

The process of forming a secondary lysosome involves merging pre-lysosomes with primary lysosomes. Pre-lysosomes originate from either endocytic vesicles (heterophagy) or autophagic vesicles (autophagy), and primary lysosomes contain hydrolases. Upon merging, the hydrolases from primary lysosomes help in digesting the material inside the vesicle, forming a secondary lysosome.

## Describe the final phase of lysosomal digestion depicted in Figure 6.16 by de Duve and Wattriaux (1966).

The final phase of lysosomal digestion depicted in Figure 6.16 is the formation of residual bodies. This phase involves the packaging of undigested material into residual bodies, which are eventually expelled out of the cell.
