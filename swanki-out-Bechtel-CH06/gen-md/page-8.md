## Describe the primary mechanisms of aerobic respiration that the cyclophorase system carries out.

The cyclophorase system carries out several key mechanisms of aerobic respiration: fatty acid oxidation, the citric acid cycle, the respiratory chain, and oxidative phosphorylation. This system is composed of a single, physically structured group of enzymes that facilitate these metabolic processes.

## What evidence did Green provide to support the existence of the cyclophorase system?

Green's primary evidence was his failure to isolate the enzyme catalyzing pyruvic to acetic acid using cell fractionation techniques. His preparation from rabbit kidney metabolized pyruvic acid all the way to carbon dioxide and water without isolating individual enzymes, suggesting a structured system of enzymes working together.

## What is the significance of the term "cyclophorase" in Green's conceptualization?

Green used the term "cyclophorase" to refer to a system of enzymes involved in the citric acid cycle. He explained that it literally means the system of enzymes carrying through the citric acid cycle. This term underscores the cooperative action and physical arrangement of enzymes that facilitate aerobic respiration.

## What was the discrepancy between Green's initial claims and Lehninger's work, and how did it affect Green's view of the cyclophorase system?

Initially, Green claimed that the cyclophorase system was a newly discovered constituent of the cell. However, after learning of Lehninger's work, Green had to be convinced that his cyclophorase system was linked to the mitochondrion. This new understanding influenced his acceptance of the system's association with mitochondrial functions.
