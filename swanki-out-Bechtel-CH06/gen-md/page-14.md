## What major discovery did Sjöstrand and Rhodin reveal with their micrograph of mitochondria in guinea pig retina?

Sjöstrand and Rhodin's micrograph of mitochondria in guinea pig retina revealed what they called internal membranes, which they construed as separate structures, discontinuous with the outer mitochondrial membrane and with each other.

## How did the high-resolution electron microscopy used by Sjöstrand and Rhodin impact the understanding of mitochondrial structure?

The high-resolution electron microscopy employed by Sjöstrand and Rhodin unveiled intricate details of the mitochondrial structure, specifically the identification of internal membranes, which they saw as separate entities from the outer mitochondrial membrane and from each other.

## What publication featured Sjöstrand's high-resolution micrographs of guinea pig retina and what was the significance of these images?

Sjöstrand's high-resolution micrographs of guinea pig retina were published in Nature in 1953, demonstrating greater clarity of Palade’s cristae, which was a significant improvement over previous micrographs.
