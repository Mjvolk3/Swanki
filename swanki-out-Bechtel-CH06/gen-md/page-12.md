## Explain the arguments Palade (1953) used to localize enzyme systems in the cristae of mitochondria.

Palade (1953) offered three primary arguments for localizing the enzyme systems in the cristae of mitochondria. First, he noted that experiments suggested substrate penetration inside the mitochondrion before being acted upon. Second, particles of similar size to individual cristae with most of the succinoxidase systems were isolated from disintegrated mitochondria, suggesting their location. Finally, enzyme systems in the cristae would be less exposed and protected from disruption compared to those in the outer membrane.

## Discuss the contributions of Fritiof Stig Sjöstrand to the field of electron microscopy.

Fritiof Stig Sjöstrand established a significant electron microscopy laboratory at the Karolinska Institute in the 1950s. Early in his career, he began working with an electron microscope and published micrographs of muscle in 1943. Despite challenges like limited access to electron microscopes, he continued his work and ultimately contributed to confirming the organization of the enzymes and coenzymes in mitochondria.

## How did the findings of Palade and Sjöstrand affect the hypothesis of mitochondrial organization in 1957-58 according to Green?

Green (1957-58) credits electron micrographs from Palade and Sjöstrand with providing independent confirmation of the mitochondria's organization. These studies refuted the hypothesis that all the enzymes and coenzymes in the mitochondria were freely diffusible molecular species in the fluid interior, supporting the view of a more organized structure within the mitochondrial membranes.

## What experiment did Lehninger conduct related to mitochondria and enzyme systems as mentioned by Palade (1953)?

Lehninger conducted experiments that indicated substrates need to penetrate inside the mitochondrion before being acted upon, forming one of the arguments used by Palade (1953) to localize enzyme systems in the cristae of mitochondria.
