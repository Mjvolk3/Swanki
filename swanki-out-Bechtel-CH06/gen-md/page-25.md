## What is the mechanism proposed by Lehninger for the generation of high-energy bonds in oxidative phosphorylation? 

Lehninger proposed that it was the oxidized carrier (the cytochrome surrendering the electrons) that formed the high-energy bond. This conclusion was based on evidence from exchange reactions showing that the reactions occurred at a maximal rate when the carriers were kept in a fully oxidized state, but not in a reduced one.

## According to Lehninger, what happens at the first phosphorylation site in the electron transport chain?

At the first site, the oxidation results in DPN forming a high-energy bond with the enzyme ($\mathrm{DPN} \sim \mathrm{X}$). Inorganic phosphate then replaces DPN in the bond, yielding $\mathrm{P} \sim \mathrm{X}$. Finally, ADP replaces the enzyme ($\mathrm{X}$), producing ATP and releasing the enzyme.

$$
\text{DPN} + \text{X} \rightarrow \text{DPN} \sim \text{X} \\
\text{DPN} \sim \text{X} + \text{Pi} \rightarrow \text{P} \sim \text{X} + \text{DPN} \\
\text{P} \sim \text{X} + \text{ADP} \rightarrow \text{ATP} + \text{X}
$$

## What is the significance of the carriers being kept in a fully oxidized state in Lehninger's mechanism?

The significance is that the reactions involved in the generation of high-energy bonds occur at a maximal rate when the carriers are in a fully oxidized state. This supported Lehninger's proposal that it is the oxidized carrier that forms the high-energy bond with the enzyme.

## What role does inorganic phosphate ($\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$) play in the oxidative phosphorylation mechanism proposed by Lehninger?

Inorganic phosphate ($\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$) replaces the carrier in the high-energy bond with the enzyme, forming $\mathrm{P} \sim \mathrm{X}$. This is a crucial step before ADP replaces the enzyme to form ATP.
