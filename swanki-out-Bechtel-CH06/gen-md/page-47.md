## What did Palade discover about proteolytic enzyme activity in starved versus recently fed animals?

Palade discovered that in starved animals, there was no appreciable proteolytic enzyme activity in microsomes. In contrast, in recently fed animals, the proteolytic enzyme activity in microsomes approximated that of the zymogen particles.

This indicates that feeding influences the concentration of these enzymes, suggesting their association with new protein synthesis, especially given their initial association with microsomal particles.

## What significance did Palade attribute to the granules in the endoplasmic reticulum?

Palade found that the granules within the cavities of the endoplasmic reticulum were biochemically identified for the first time as products of the endoplasmic reticulum, distinct from the zymogen granules.

This biochemical identification marks a major step in understanding the role of the endoplasmic reticulum in cell biology and protein synthesis.

## What evidence did Palade use to support the hypothesis that microsomal particles synthesized new proteins?

Palade cited evidence using labeled leucine-I-C ${ }^{14}$, showing that its earliest incorporation occurred in the particles still attached to the membrane. A little later, the label was found in the intracisternal granules and subsequently in the zymogen granules.

This time-sequenced incorporation suggests a pathway of protein synthesis starting from the microsomal particles, supporting the hypothesis of these particles being protein synthesis sites.

## What led to the adoption of the term "ribosome"?

During the first symposium of the Biophysical Society at MIT in 1958, participants faced semantic difficulties with the term "microsomal particles." The term "ribosome" was suggested to more accurately describe the ribonucleoprotein particles of the microsome fraction, eliminating confusion and resulting in its adoption.

The new term reflects both the composition and function of these particles more precisely, facilitating the standardization of scientific communication.
