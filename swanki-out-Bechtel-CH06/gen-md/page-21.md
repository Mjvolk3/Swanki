## Describe the process Green used to fractionate mitochondria and the significance of the different fractions obtained.

Green developed a procedure for large-scale fractionation of mitochondria using beef hearts. The process resulted in a light fraction that lacked the capacity to synthesize ATP when oxidizing succinate and a heavy fraction that retained that capacity. Both fractions could phosphorylate ATP when supplied with other citric acid cycle substrates. By treating the light fraction with $15\%$ alcohol, Green further subdivided it into subfractions, one of which could carry out electron transport but not oxidative phosphorylation.

## What was the primary goal of applying fractionation to mitochondrial fractions according to the paper?

The primary goal of applying fractionation to mitochondrial fractions was to localize different enzymes in different components of the mitochondrion. This would help researchers identify which parts of the mitochondrion were responsible for specific processes, such as oxidative phosphorylation.

## Explain Rasmussen's perspective on the different approaches taken by Palade and Sjöstrand in their research

Rasmussen maintained that a fundamental difference between Palade and Sjöstrand involved their respective relations to biochemistry. Sjöstrand emphasized the authority of the electron microscope, potentially conflicting with biochemists. In contrast, Palade's Rockefeller approach involved a partnership with fractionation biochemists, setting modest goals for electron microscopy to describe topology and associations among components in situ, thereby avoiding conflicts.

## How did the approach to fractionation by Rockefeller researchers differ from the perspective discussed in Part 2 of the chapter?

The Rockefeller researchers, including Palade, treated fractionation as a primary tool in their research, which helped link cell structures to biochemical operations. While Rasmussen viewed this as minimizing territorial conflicts, an alternative view treats it as an internally motivated scientific program that inherently minimized conflicts. This emphasizes scientific progress over sociological factors.
