## What method did Christian de Duve initially employ to isolate glucose-6-phosphatase, and what was the observed issue with the enzyme in acid solution?

Christian de Duve initially employed differential centrifugation to isolate glucose-6-phosphatase. He observed that when glucose-6-phosphatase was precipitated in an acid solution, it could not be redissolved when the pH level was raised. This suggested to de Duve that agglutination, not precipitation, was occurring, indicating that the enzyme was attached to a structure.

## Which collaboration helped Christian de Duve further his research on glucose metabolism, and what discovery arose during this collaboration?

Christian de Duve collaborated with Carl and Gerty Cori at Washington University. During this collaboration, it was discovered that glucagon, not insulin, was the responsible agent for certain actions previously ascribed to insulin. This discovery arose during de Duve's collaboration with postdoctoral fellow Earl Sutherland, who later won a Nobel Prize for the discovery of cyclic AMP.

## What was the primary function of the lysosome that led to its identification, and how did this differ from the identification processes of other organelles?

The primary function of the lysosome that led to its identification was its role in enzymatic activity, specifically in degrading cellular components. This process of identification through function differed from other organelles, which were typically identified based on morphological observations before their biochemical functions were studied.

## Describe the transition Christian de Duve made in his experimental technique for isolating glucose-6-phosphatase. What did he achieve using cell fractionation instead of the Waring blender?

Christian de Duve transitioned from using the Waring blender to cell fractionation as a gentler method for isolating glucose-6-phosphatase. Using cell fractionation, he localized 95% of the enzyme's activity in the microsomal fraction, which was a significant improvement in isolating the enzyme without causing further agglutination.
