## How was it demonstrated that protein transport to the Golgi complex does not depend on new proteins entering the process?

In their experiments, Jamieson and Palade used cyclohexamide to block protein synthesis. They showed that even when protein synthesis was blocked, protein transport to the Golgi complex continued. This demonstrated that the transport process did not depend on the continued synthesis of new proteins entering the process.

## Explain the energy requirements for protein transport as demonstrated by Jamieson and Palade.

Jamieson and Palade demonstrated that glycolytic inhibitors (fluoride, iodoacetate) did not block protein transport, while respiratory inhibitors (N2, cyanide, antimycin A) and inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation (dinitrophenol, oligomycin) did. This indicates that the energy required for protein transport comes from oxidative phosphorylation rather than glycolysis.

## What are the two hypotheses proposed for the mechanism of protein connection between the RER cisternal space and that of the condensing vacuoles?

The two hypotheses proposed by Jamieson and Palade are:
1. Intermittent connections between the RER cisternal space and the condensing vacuoles.
2. Transport using small peripheral vesicles as shuttle carriers.
Both hypotheses imply repeated membrane fission-fusion events, which are considered to be the energy-requiring steps.

## What model did P. P. Grassé propose regarding the function of the Golgi stack, and how does it differ from Palade's hypothesis?

P. P. Grassé proposed a maturational or cisternal progression model, suggesting that cisternae are continually created on the cis side of the stack, mature as they move to the trans side, and disintegrate to release their contents. This differs from Palade's hypothesis, which favors small peripheral vesicles serving as shuttle carriers where nascent proteins remain membrane-bound as they traverse the Golgi structure.
