## How did Racker determine that $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ and ATPase were the same protein?

Racker identified $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ coupling and ATPase activity as the same protein by showing that both decayed at the same rate around $0^{\circ}$.

## What is the function of coupling factor $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ in phosphorylation?

Coupling factor $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ catalyzes the transphosphorylation step from $X P$ to ADP to form ATP at phosphorylation Sites 1 and 2.

## Describe the relationship between $F_0$ and $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ in terms of oligomycin sensitivity and particle generation.

Addition of $F_0$ to $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ provided oligomycin sensitivity and when treated with a salt solution, $F_0F_1$ generated particles.

## What is the significance of negative staining in electron microscopy as introduced by Humberto Fernández-Morán?

Negative staining revealed additional structure in the mitochondrion, providing deeper insights into its morphology.
