## What method did Fernández-Morán use to make mitochondria components visible in an electron micrograph?

Fernández-Morán used negative staining with substances such as phosphotungstate or uranyl acetate, which are electron dense but chemically inert. This method makes membrane material appear light against the dark background created by the electron dense material.

## What specific journal and article did Fernández-Morán publish his findings about mitochondria?

Fernández-Morán published his findings in the article titled, \textit{A macromolecular repeating unit of mitochondrial structure and function: Correlated electron microscopic and biochemical studies of isolated mitochondria and submitochondrial particles of beef heart muscle}, in the Journal of Cell Biology, volume 22, pages 63-100, 1964.

## Explain the principle of negative staining used in Fernández-Morán's study and its purpose in electron microscopy.

Negative staining involves using electron-dense but chemically inert substances such as phosphotungstate or uranyl acetate. These substances do not react with membrane material, causing the membrane to appear light against a dark background created by the electron-dense material. This method highlights small structures that would otherwise be difficult to see.
