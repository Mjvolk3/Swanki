## Explain the orientation of intracellular membranes as described by Sjöstrand and Hanzon (1954).

According to Sjöstrand and Hanzon (1954), the intracellular membranes have specific orientations: mitochondria, zymogen granules, and the cell membrane have their rough side facing these structures, while cytoplasmic membranes adjacent to the nuclear membrane have their smooth surface directed towards the nuclear membrane.

## Compare the surface characteristics of cytoplasmic membranes near the nuclear membrane to those near mitochondria.

Cytoplasmic membranes near the nuclear membrane have a smooth surface directed towards the nuclear membrane, while those near mitochondria have a rough surface facing the mitochondria.

## What is the significance of the membrane structure of the cytoplasm and mitochondria in exocrine cells of the mouse pancreas?

The study by Sjöstrand and Hanzon (1954) using high-resolution electron microscopy provides detailed insight into the structure of intracellular membranes, revealing the arrangement of paired membranes and their associated particles, which could be crucial for understanding cellular processes and functions in exocrine cells of the pancreas.

## Discuss the method used by Sjöstrand and Hanzon (1954) to study the membrane structure of the cytoplasm and mitochondria.

Sjöstrand and Hanzon (1954) employed high-resolution electron microscopy to study the membrane structure of the cytoplasm and mitochondria in exocrine cells of the mouse pancreas. This method allowed them to obtain detailed images of the paired intracellular membranes and small opaque particles, enhancing our understanding of cellular architecture.
