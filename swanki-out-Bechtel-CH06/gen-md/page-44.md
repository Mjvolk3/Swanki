## What were the main contributions of Philip Siekevitz to the study of protein synthesis when he was working with Zamecnik?

Philip Siekevitz adapted techniques from Hogeboom et al. to create a fraction containing both mitochondria and microsomes for studying the incorporation of labeled amino acids. He found that adding citric acid cycle intermediates increased incorporation and that adding ATP could foster incorporation even when respiration was suppressed.

## Explain the role of ATP in the process of protein synthesis as revealed by Zamecnik, Keller, and Hoagland's studies.

Zamecnik, Keller, and Hoagland discovered that ATP interacted with amino acids, forming an amino acyl ã€œ AMP compound. This reaction activates the amino acid, enabling it to form a peptide bond with another amino acid during protein synthesis.

$$
\text{Amino Acid} + \text{ATP} \rightarrow \text{Amino acyl-AMP} + \text{PPi}
$$

## What specific fractions and supplements were required for protein synthesis as discovered by Zamecnik and Elizabeth Keller?

Zamecnik and Elizabeth Keller showed that the microsomal and supernatant fractions were required for protein synthesis. These fractions needed to be supplemented by ATP and guanosine triphosphate (GTP).

## How did the Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer contribute to the advancements in protein synthesis research?

The Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer enabled further enhancements in the fractionation procedure. Using this device, Nancy Bucher demonstrated the incorporation of labeled acetate into cholesterol and subsequently into proteins, leading to significant advances in understanding protein synthesis.
