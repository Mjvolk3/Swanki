## What is the significance of $\mathrm{R}$ in the generic structure of an amino acid?

The $\mathrm{R}$ group represents the portion in which different amino acids vary.

## What does the formation of a peptide bond between glycine and alanine involve?

The formation of a peptide bond between glycine and alanine involves the removal of a water molecule.

The process can be represented by:

$$
\text{Glycine} + \text{Alanine} \rightarrow \text{Peptide bond} + \text{Water}
$$

## Explain the use of $\mathrm{C}^{14}$-labeled amino acids in Zamecnik's studies. 

$\mathrm{C}^{14}$-labeled amino acids were used to trace the uptake of amino acids, such as alanine and glycine, into tissue slices from both normal and malignant rats.

$$
\text{Labeled amino-acid} (\mathrm{C}^{14}) \xrightarrow{\text{Absorption}} \text{Tissue slices}
$$

## What was the procedure used by Elizabeth Keller to study $\mathrm{C}^{14}$-labeled amino acids in rats, and what did she find?

Elizabeth Keller injected rats with low doses of $\mathrm{C}^{14}$-labeled amino acids, formed a homogenate from their liver cells, and centrifuged it. In rats sacrificed within twenty minutes, she found most of the labeled amino acids in the microsomal fraction, but not after longer delays.

$$
\text{Injection} \rightarrow \text{Sacrifice} \rightarrow \text{Homogenate} \rightarrow \text{Centrifugation}
