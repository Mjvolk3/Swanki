## According to Palade (1953), how does the inner membrane of the mitochondrion behave in comparison to Sjöstrand's (1956) interpretation?

Palade (1953) proposed that the inner membrane folded into the interior to form cristae, whereas Sjöstrand (1956) argued that the double-layered membranes traversing the mitochondrion were not attached to the (also double-layered) outer membrane.

## What does Sjöstrand (1956) claim about the structure of double-layered membranes traversing the mitochondrion?

Sjöstrand (1956) claimed that the double-layered membranes traversing the mitochondrion went fully across the mitochondrion and were not attached to the outer membrane.

## When Palade (1953) accepted Sjöstrand’s claim during a symposium, what new interpretation did he propose regarding the mitochondrial structure?

Palade (1953) proposed that it was only the inner membrane which folded into the interior to form cristae, thus distinguishing it from the outer membrane which does not infold.

## What did Sjöstrand mean by interpreting the mitochondrial membrane structure in terms of Danielli and Davson's sandwich model?

Sjöstrand referred to a single double-layered membrane where the outer layers of proteins accounted for the two dark bands, while the inner phospholipid layer accounted for the lighter area between them, based on Danielli and Davson’s sandwich model.
