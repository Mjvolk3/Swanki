## Describe Sjöstrand's interpretation of mitochondrial structure as presented in the 1954 VIIIth Congress of Cell Biology.

Sjöstrand contended that the inner membranes of mitochondria are not continuous with the outer membrane, and there is no central space extending the length of the mitochondrion. He argued that inner membranes might sometimes form partial septa, allowing communication between compartments.

## Sjöstrand's view of the central space depicted by Palade was that it is a fixation artefact. Consider the role of hypotonic media in this artefact. Why might Sjöstrand have criticized Palade's method?

Sjöstrand argued that the central space depicted by Palade was a result of the swelling of mitochondria in hypotonic media, specifically buffered osmium tetroxide solution. According to Sjöstrand, Palade's method, which involved a strongly hypotonic solution, led to this artefact.

## If Sjöstrand's view on mitochondrial structure is correct, then how might this affect our understanding of the enzyme localization within mitochondria as related to biochemical functions?

Sjöstrand was skeptical about linking mitochondrial structure to specific biochemical functions. He argued that, although the membranes might help in the spatial arrangement of enzymes involved in chain reactions, there isn't enough information to claim where enzyme molecules are precisely located in mitochondria.

## How might Palade's hypothesis differ from Sjöstrand's in terms of interpreting the structural features and functions of mitochondria? Provide context based on both their assertions.

Palade proposed that the inner structure of mitochondria (including central space) could be linked to the biochemical function, such as the spatial arrangement of enzymes. Sjöstrand countered this by emphasizing that observed structures might be artefacts from preparation methods and that we lack definitive knowledge about enzyme locations within mitochondria.
