## Understanding how longitudinal sections reveal mitochondrial structure.
Palade mentioned two possible ways that ridges could project into the interior of the mitochondria. If the ridges project only partway into the interior, what pattern should they display in sections passing lengthwise through the middle of the organelle?

%
Ridges that project only partway into the interior should show free ends partially outlining a central channel or cavity in sections passing lengthwise through the middle of the organelles.

## The inference from serial sections
What did Palade use to argue that cristae are ridges rather than continuous bands, and what feature did he particularly pay attention to?

%
Palade used sequential serial sections to argue that the cristae are ridges rather than continuous bands. He focused on the fact that different ridges disappear as one moves from slice to slice, which supports the idea that the cristae are ridges.

## The intermembrane space discovery
Palade presented evidence that the cristae are actually infoldings of the inner mitochondrial membrane. He also mentioned a specific space found between the mitochondrial membranes. What is this space called, and what is its significance?

%
The space found between the two mitochondrial membranes is called the intermembrane space. Its significance lies in its approximate width being the same as the central light layer of the cristae, indicating that they communicate freely (p. 207).

## Differences in interpretation by Palade and the Swedish group
What was a major difference in the interpretation of mitochondrial structure between Palade and Sjöstrand's group, and how did they name the membranes?

%
A major difference in interpretation was that Sjöstrand's group presented the two membranes at the mitochondrion's periphery as a single unit called the "outer double membrane," whereas Palade recognized them as two separate membranes. Additionally, Sjöstrand's group named the cristae "inner double membranes" and did not recognize them as infoldings but as individual structures with topographical relations to the outer membrane.
