### What role did electron microscopy play in the study of the Golgi apparatus?

Electron microscopy, particularly the studies carried out by Albert Dalton, was crucial in revealing the detailed structure of the Golgi apparatus. Dalton's initial research showed a membranous network in cells where the Golgi apparatus was typically detected, undermining previous hypotheses regarding the Golgi's formation.

### What did Dalton and Felix's research reveal about the Golgi material in comparison to lipid droplets?

Dalton and Felix discovered that the Golgi material responded very differently to fixation than lipid droplets. This evidence dispelled the proposal that the Golgi apparatus was merely an artifact created from lipid droplets during cell fixation.

### Describe the cellular structures labeled in the electron micrograph of a mouse's duodenum.

The electron micrograph of the Golgi complex in a principal cell of a mouse's duodenum shows various labeled structures: Golgi membrane (flattened cisternal sacs), GV (Golgi vacuoles), V (Golgi vesicles), L (Lipid droplets), M (mitochondria), N (nucleus), and E (ergastoplasm/endoplasmic reticulum).

### How did Dalton and Felix's studies challenge Palade and Claude's hypothesis about the Golgi apparatus?

Dalton and Felix's research showed significant structural details of the Golgi apparatus that contradicted Palade and Claude's hypothesis, which suggested that the Golgi apparatus was an artifact formed from lipid droplets. Their findings demonstrated distinct responses of Golgi material to fixation, clarifying that the Golgi apparatus is a genuine cellular structure.
