## Discuss the contrasting observations made by Porter and Sjöstrand about the endoplasmic reticulum.

Both Porter and Sjöstrand studied the endoplasmic reticulum but arrived at different conclusions. While Porter observed that the endoplasmic reticulum mainly consisted of large, flat cisternae with fine granular material on the outer surface, Sjöstrand criticized this view and argued that the cytoplasm was divided into open compartments through well-defined intracellular double membranes. Moreover, Sjöstrand and Rhodin identified small opaque particles attached to one side of these membranes.

## Explain the significance of fine granular material found on the endoplasmic reticulum by Palade.

Palade observed that the outer surface of the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum was often coated with fine granular material, ranging from 10 to $30 \mu m$ in size. This granular material was significant because Porter argued that it was the source of basophilic staining in the cytoplasm. Porter related these granules to particles containing large amounts of RNA, identified in previous studies, and he concluded that similar particles were present in the nucleolus.

## Describe the initial skepticism Porter had towards the particles observed by Palade.

Porter initially responded to the granular particles seen by Palade on the endoplasmic reticulum with skepticism, suggesting that they were likely artifacts caused by damage from the electron beam. He even referred to them sarcastically as "Palade particles." Over time, however, evidence increasingly supported the presence of these particles and their physiological significance.

## How did Porter link the fine granular material on the endoplasmic reticulum to basophilic staining in the cytoplasm?

Porter observed that the fine granular material on the endoplasmic reticulum caused significant basophilic staining in tissues where these granules were attached. He suggested that these particles were the basophilic components of the cytoplasm. Furthermore, he related these particles to a fraction containing large amounts of RNA, similar to the fraction identified by Barnum and Huseby, and observed particles of the same size in the nucleolus.
