## What is the significance of the reaction between cytochrome c and oxygen in cellular respiration?

The reaction between cytochrome $c$ and oxygen is crucial in cellular respiration as it plays a key role in the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons and contributing to the generation of ATP.

## What are the main steps involved in oxidative phosphorylation according to Lehninger and colleagues?

According to Lehninger and colleagues, oxidative phosphorylation involves separate, sequential steps:

- Phosphate and ADP enter into oxidative phosphorylation in separate steps.
- The enzyme first reacts with the phosphate, creating a high-energy intermediate (e.g., $\mathrm{X} \sim \mathrm{P}$).
- The intermediate then reacts with ADP to form ATP.

$$
\text{Enzyme} + \text{Phosphate (P)} \rightarrow \text{High-energy intermediate} \rightarrow \text{Intermediate} + \text{ADP} \rightarrow \text{ATP}
$$

## Explain the difference between the two alternatives considered by Lehninger and colleagues for the final events in phosphorylation.

Lehninger and colleagues considered two alternatives for the final events in phosphorylation:

1. The enzyme reacts first with phosphate, creating a high-energy intermediate (e.g., $\mathrm{X} \sim \mathrm{P}$), which then reacts with ADP to form ATP.
2. The enzyme reacts first with ADP, creating an intermediate (e.g., $\mathrm{X} \sim \mathrm{ADP}$), which then reacts with phosphate.

The evidence from the exchange reaction supported the first alternative where the enzyme first reacts with phosphate.

$$
\text{Alternative 1:} \quad \mathrm{X} + \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{X} \sim \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{X} + \mathrm{ATP}
$$

$$
\text{Alternative 2:} \quad \mathrm{X} + \mathrm{ADP} \rightarrow \mathrm{X} \sim \mathrm{ADP} \rightarrow \mathrm{X} + \mathrm{ATP}
$$

## Describe the exchange reactions involved in oxidative phosphorylation and their inhibition by decoupling agents as studied by Cooper and Lehninger.

The exchange reactions in oxidative phosphorylation involve:

1. Exchange of a free phosphate with one in ATP.
2. Transfer of a phosphate from an ATP molecule to an ADP molecule.

These reactions occur in digitonin-prepared particles and are inhibited by decoupling agents. The inhibition by decoupling agents indicates the importance of coupled processes in oxidative phosphorylation.

$$
\text{Reaction 1: } \mathrm{ATP} + \mathrm{Pi} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{ATP-Pi}
$$

$$
\text{Reaction 2: } \mathrm{ATP} + \mathrm{ADP} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{ATP-ADP}
$$
