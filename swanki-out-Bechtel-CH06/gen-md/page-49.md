## Explain the role of "soluble RNA" as discovered by Zamecnik and its subsequent renaming to transfer RNA (tRNA).

Zamecnik and his colleagues discovered that "soluble RNA" (S-RNA) binds with labeled leucine. Smith, Cordes, and Schweet later introduced the term "transfer RNA" (tRNA) to describe S-RNA, proposing its role in transferring activated amino acids to the microsomal RNA.

## Describe the concept of tRNA as an adaptor in protein synthesis, as proposed by Crick and Zamecnik.

Zamecnik and Crick proposed that tRNA serves as an adaptor, aligning with microsomal RNA through base-pairing to determine amino acid sequence during protein synthesis. This hypothesis was crucial in explaining the sequencing of amino acids.

## Define the experimental contribution of Nirenberg and Matthaei in identifying messenger RNA (mRNA).

Nirenberg and Matthaei's experiments with uracil synthetic RNA led to the synthesis of phenylalanine-containing amino acid chains, providing the first indication of the genetic code and evidence for messenger RNA (mRNA) carrying protein information from the nucleus to the ribosome.

## Explain how ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and tRNA interact during protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells.

In eukaryotic cells, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) directs the synthesis of peptides by remaining in place while tRNA brings specific amino acids to the template according to the sequence specified by the mRNA. The tRNA then departs after adding its amino acid to the growing chain.
