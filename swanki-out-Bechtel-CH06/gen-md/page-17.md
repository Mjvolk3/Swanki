### Card 1

## In the mid-20th century, Sjöstrand and Palade had differing interpretations of mitochondrial structure in electron micrographs. What did Sjöstrand argue was the primary factor leading to high-resolution micrographs and what technique did he propose to maintain this factor?

Sjöstrand maintained that a primary factor in generating high-resolution micrographs was keeping the tissue in as life-like a condition as possible. To achieve this, he proposed injecting fixative directly into living animals as quickly as possible.

### Card 2

## According to Sjöstrand, what post-mortem changes could explain the central space observed in Palade's mitochondrial micrographs?

Sjöstrand argued that post-mortem changes, within 15-30 to 45 minutes after death, led to swelling and the fragmentation of the inner mitochondrial membranes, resulting in a central space free from inner membranes. He proposed that these changes might be responsible for the central space described by Palade.

### Card 3

## What did Palade observe in his 1952 paper that contributed to the debate with Sjöstrand regarding mitochondrial structure?

In his 1952 paper, Palade commented: "In longitudinal sections that cut close to the mitochondrial membrane, the appearance of the lamellae might suggest that they are septa that traverse the mitochondrion from side to side. Oblique sections, however, indicate that the lamellae are actually ridges or folds protruding from the inside surface of the mitochondrial membrane towards the interior of the organelle without reaching the other side."

### Card 4

## Explain the significance of the term $f_{c}$ in Palade's mitochondrial model. How did it contribute to our understanding of mitochondrial structure?

In Palade's model, $f_{c}$ referred to the central free channel, later called the mitochondrial matrix. This area illustrated the open space within the mitochondria, which was a point of contention between Palade and Sjöstrand. Their differing interpretations of this structure contributed to our evolving understanding of mitochondrial organization and function.
