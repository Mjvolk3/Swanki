## How did Keilin and Hartree's (1944) findings inform the understanding of mitochondrial particulate structure in oxidative phosphorylation?

Keilin and Hartree (1944) discovered that they could not eliminate cell particulates from extract preparations capable of performing oxidative phosphorylation, which indicated that the respiratory function was connected with the physico-chemical structure of the cell.

## What was the "nuisance" regarding cell particulates according to Lehninger (1951)?

Lehninger (1951) referred to the involvement of cell particulates as a nuisance because most biochemists aimed to work out the purely chemical steps in oxidative phosphorylation, similar to how glycolysis was understood. Cell particulates complicated this objective by adding a physical dimension to biochemical processes.

## What theoretical contribution did Lippman (1941) make regarding ATP?

Lippman (1941) characterized the phosphate bonds in ATP as energy-rich bonds and introduced the symbol $\sim \mathrm{P}$ for these bonds. These bonds were later commonly referred to as high-energy bonds.

## Describe the role of glycolysis in substrate-level phosphorylation.

In glycolysis, the initial substrate (glucose) and the penultimate product (pyruvic acid) do not contain phosphates, but various intermediates do. Phosphates are added at three different steps in the process and transferred to ADP in later steps, yielding energy-rich ATP. This process is known as substrate-level phosphorylation.
