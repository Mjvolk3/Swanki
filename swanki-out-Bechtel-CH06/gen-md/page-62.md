## According to the chunk of the paper provided, what evidence led de Duve to conclude that acid phosphatase activity was initially masked and activated over time?

De Duve stored fractions in a refrigerator and observed that, after five days, the acid phosphatase activity increased by an order of magnitude, suggesting that the enzyme activity was initially masked and only activated over time.

## What hypothesis did de Duve propose about the containment and activation of acid phosphatase in fractionated cells?

De Duve hypothesized that acid phosphatase was contained within a separate "baglike" particle upon initial fractionation, which limited its access to the substrate. This explains why the enzyme activity became measurable only after being released either by rough treatment or by aging.

## What was the significant finding when de Duve continued fractionating cells and segregated a light fraction containing acid phosphatase and a heavy fraction containing cytochrome oxidase?

De Duve found that the light fraction containing acid phosphatase exhibited enzymatic activity while the heavy fraction containing cytochrome oxidase did not. This differentiation was crucial in understanding that acid phosphatase was not housed in the mitochondrion, but likely in a different cellular compartment.

## What discovery did de Duve make at the Second International Congress of Biochemistry in 1952 regarding $\beta$-glucuronidase, and how did it influence his further research?

De Duve discovered that his light fraction, which contained acid phosphatase, also contained $\beta$-glucuronidase after a British biochemist, P.G. Walker, suggested similar findings. This led de Duve to investigate other enzymes, confirming the presence of several other hydrolases in his light fraction.
