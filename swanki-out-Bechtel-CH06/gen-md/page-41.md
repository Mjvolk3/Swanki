## Discuss the significance of the opaque particles observed in osmium tetroxide preparations according to Sjöstrand.

Sjöstrand noted that the opaque particles in the cytoplasm react very strongly with osmium tetroxide and suggested that:

$$
\text{they represent the dominating structure of the cytoplasm of the exocrine pancreas cells.}
$$

He inferred that these structures are important for enzyme synthesis in these cells.

## Explain why Sjöstrand rejected the interpretation that certain structures identified by other microscopists were filaments.

Sjöstrand argued that the structures in question were membranes and not filaments due to their continuous visibility through the whole basal cell zone. Specifically, he stated:

$$
\text{the chance to hit a filament so exactly along its entire length is negligible, and there are no indications of cross-cut filaments.}
$$

## What was Sjöstrand's argument regarding the number of membranes near the nucleus, and what conclusion did he derive?

In his paper with Hanzon, Sjöstrand noted:

$$
\text{The number of membranes in the cell was always odd, due to the innermost membrane not having a partner.}
$$

He concluded that this would not be the case if the structures were filaments, reinforcing his interpretation that they are indeed membranes.

## What was Sjöstrand’s main argument at the Eighth Congress of Cell Biology symposium regarding the generalization of cytoplasmic structures?

At the symposium, Sjöstrand related his observations to those of other scientists and cautioned against overgeneralization:

$$
\text{For the moment we may not generalize further than accepting that in the cytoplasm there exist granules.}
$$

He emphasized the importance of not assuming all observed structures have a common chemical and functional significance.
