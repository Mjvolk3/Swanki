## Describe the process used by Lehninger and colleagues to isolate "phosphorylating membrane fragments" from rat liver mitochondria.

Lehninger and his team treated isolated mitochondria with digitonin, breaking down membrane lipids and causing the "virtual dissolution" of the mitochondrion. The solution was centrifuged at $50,000 \mathrm{~g}$ for 25 minutes, and the supernatant fluid was further centrifuged at $100,000 \mathrm{~g}$ for 25 minutes, yielding "phosphorylating membrane fragments."

## Which biochemical agents were found to decouple respiration from phosphorylation in the study by Lehninger and colleagues?

Most typical agents like 2,4-dinitrophenol decoupled respiration from phosphorylation, but $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and thyroxine did not.

## What conclusion was derived about the locations of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation based on Lehninger's findings?

The findings suggested that the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion, while electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation occur in the cristae of the inner mitochondrial membrane.

## What did the use of sonic vibrations before centrifugation demonstrate regarding the inner membrane of mitochondria?

The use of sonic vibrations prior to centrifugation greatly reduced the sedimentation rate but not the efficacy of the particles, leading Lehninger and Cooper to conclude that the inner membrane consisted of repetitive structures.
