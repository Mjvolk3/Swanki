## What was Lehningerâ€™s bold proposal about the organization of carrier proteins in oxidative phosphorylation?

Lehninger's proposal was that carrier proteins must be fixed in space to increase the probability of electron passage, or that special mechanisms exist to allow this through the protein structures.

## According to Lehninger's experiment, when does one phosphorylating event occur in the electron transport chain?

One phosphorylating event occurs between cytochrome $c$ and oxygen after pretreatment of the preparations.

## What experimental technique did Chance and Williams use to identify zones of phosphorylation in the oxidative pathway?

Chance and Williams used spectrography to determine the oxidation state of intermediates and employed inhibitors along with ADP to identify zones of phosphorylation.

## What controversial claim did David Green advance in 1948 about enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation?

In 1948, David Green advanced the claim that the enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation constitute an organized system, a departure from the traditional focus on soluble enzymes.
