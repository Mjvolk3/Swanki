## Explain Svedberg units (S) in the context of ribosome research. Discuss the significance and the calculation of Svedberg units.

Ribosome components are often measured in Svedberg units (S), a measure of sedimentation rate. One Svedberg unit is defined as:

$$1\ S = 10^{-13}\ \text{seconds}$$

## Describe the experimental observations related to ribosome subunit separation in different organisms.

Researchers observed the following during centrifugation:
- Yeast cells: 80S microsomes split into 60S and 40S, emphasized by Chao and Schachmann.
- Liver cells: 78S ribosomes decomposed into 62S and 46S, as found by Petermann et al.
- Escherichia coli: 70S ribosomes split into 50S and 30S, identified by Tissi√©res and Watson.

## {{c1::Chao and Schachmann}} reported that 80S microsomes from yeast cells dissociate into 60S and 40S units.

## Discuss the theoretical speculation made by Alexander Rich about the organization of ribosomes and mRNA. Explain Rich's conclusion on whether mRNA wraps around a ribosome.

Alexander Rich speculated:
- mRNA length: $\geq 1,500 \AA$ 
- Ribosome diameter: $\approx 230 \AA$
- Likely conclusion: mRNA does not wrap around ribosomes; instead, proteins are synthesized by multiple ribosomes coordinated together by mRNA.
