## Describe the unique structure and arrangement of the ridges in mitochondria and their implication in mitochondrial function as discussed by Palade.

Edmund Palade observed that the ridges, or cristae, in mitochondria were "trilaminar" in structure. The central layer is 8 to $10 \mathrm{\mu m}$ thick and is surrounded by two thinner, denser layers. These ridges are arranged "more or less perpendicular to the long axis of the mitochondrion."

Palade suggested that the arrangement of these ridges might serve as a criterion for identifying mitochondria in electron microscopy. This structural decomposition aids in advancing the mechanistic account of mitochondrial function by localizing different biochemical operations within different structural components.

## What hypothesis did Palade propose regarding the arrangement of enzymes within the mitochondria and the structure's relevance to mitochondrial function?

Palade hypothesized that the enzymes involved in oxidative processes within mitochondria are maintained in a "definite spatial relationship". He suggested that these enzymes are arranged in linear series or chains within the solid framework of the mitochondrion, particularly along the cristae.

## According to Palade, how do the physical properties of mitochondria support the proposed spatial organization of enzymes?

Palade integrated morphological observations with known behaviors of mitochondria, like flexibility, response to osmotic pressure, and results from centrifugation of disintegrated organelles. He proposed that the mitochondrial matrix is fluid, while the membrane and ridges (cristae) represent the solid framework. This solid framework likely hosts the enzyme chains essential for oxidative processes.

## According to the study, what key variegation did Palade and others note in the appearance of cristae between different cell types, and what is the significance of this observation?

Palade and others noted that the appearance of cristae varied between different cell types, yet they appeared to be a regular feature of mitochondria. This finding supports the notion that the structural characteristics of cristae can be leveraged for identifying mitochondria, particularly in electron microscopy, where traditional staining techniques are ineffective.
