## What did Green propose regarding the relationship between coenzymes and apoenzymes in the cyclophorase system?

Green proposed that a coenzyme was bound as a prosthetic group to the protein component of an enzyme, which he referred to as the apoenzyme. This formation requires only one coenzyme molecule per enzyme molecule, enhancing efficiency.

## What problem did Green note about the binding of pyridinenucleotide in the cyclophorase system?

Green noted that when pyridinenucleotide is bound in the cyclophorase system, its shuttle capability between oxidized and reduced forms is severely limited, posing a challenge for its interaction with a variety of systems.

## What was an important aspect of Green's conception of the cyclophorase system?

An important aspect of Green's conception was that the cyclophorase system not only links together the enzymes but also binds them to the coenzymes that figured in the reactions, crucially contributing to the efficiency of the metabolic process.

## How did biochemists in the 1950s view Green's cyclophorase proposal?

Most biochemists rejected Green's cyclophorase proposal as an excessively speculative response to the difficulty of rendering the enzymes of oxidative metabolism soluble and isolating them.
