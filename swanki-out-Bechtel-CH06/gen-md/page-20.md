## What was the focus of the intense conflict between Palade and Sjöstrand regarding mitochondrial structure?

The intense conflict centered around the differing interpretations of the mitochondrial inner membrane structure provided by Palade and Sjöstrand. Palade's interpretation, which eventually gained ascendancy, suggested that the inner membrane extended into the interior of the mitochondria and, in some cases, almost touched the other side. On the other hand, Sjöstrand's interpretation suggested that the inner membrane pieces were discontinuous both with the outer membrane and with each other. This disagreement had implications for the biochemical mechanisms attributed to mitochondrial structure, such as Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis.

## How did the interpretations of Palade and Sjöstrand differ in their views on mitochondrial inner membrane structure?

Palade's interpretation proposed that the inner membrane extended into the interior of the mitochondria, in some cases touching or almost touching the other side. Conversely, Sjöstrand's interpretation presented that the inner membrane pieces were discontinuous both with the outer membrane and with each other, resulting in a structure that could not fully support certain biochemical processes, such as the chemiosmotic hypothesis proposed by Mitchell in 1962.

## According to the paper, what did Sjöstrand focus on when using his micrographs at the Third International Conference on Electron Microscopy in 1954?

Sjöstrand focused on making quantitatively precise estimates of membrane sizes based on his micrographs. His approach was to interpret the micrographs purely visually, judging fixation by the criterion of orderliness and seeking greater knowledge of molecular structure through ever-better resolution.

## How did Palade approach the interpretation of micrographs compared to Sjöstrand, as described by Rasmussen in 1997?

Palade's approach was more integrative, emphasizing the importance of drawing out connections with findings from other techniques such as cell fractionation. Palade was involved in cell fractionation experiments himself and wanted to test micrograph interpretations against biochemical experiments on cell fractions. This contrasted with Sjöstrand's purely visual and quantitative approach to micrograph interpretation.
