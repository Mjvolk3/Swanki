## Describe the procedure used by Palade and Siekevitz to trace the migration of $\alpha$-chymotrypsinogen.

Palade and Siekevitz used ${ }^{14}\mathrm{C}$-leucine as a tracer to establish the migration path of $\alpha$-chymotrypsinogen from the ribosome into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and ultimately into zymogen granules. The experiment provided critical evidence for the transport of this secretory protein through cell compartments.

## How did Lucien Caro contribute to understanding protein transport using radioactive labeling?

Lucien Caroâ€™s use of ${ }^{3} \mathrm{H}$-leucine, which appeared within three to five minutes of injection in the endoplasmic reticulum, and then after twenty to forty minutes in the condensing vacuoles on the trans side of the Golgi stack, was critical. This method demonstrated the transport path of proteins through the Golgi apparatus to zymogen granules within cells.

## Summarize the contribution of James Jamieson and Palade in characterizing the migration of membrane-bound vesicles using guinea pig tissue slices.

James Jamieson and Palade, through a series of studies beginning in 1966, used guinea pig tissue slices and a three-minute exposure to ${ }^{14}\mathrm{C}$-leucine ("labeling pulse"), followed by removal of the unincorporated label ("chase"). This enabled them to demonstrate the encapsulation of proteins in small peripheral vesicles on the cis side of the Golgi stack, their appearance in condensing vacuoles on the trans side, and ultimately their discharge from the cell.

## What was a key methodological improvement introduced by Jamieson and Palade in their protein tracing experiments?

A key methodological improvement introduced by Jamieson and Palade was the use of a three-minute exposure to ${ }^{14}\mathrm{C}$-leucine (labeling pulse), followed by the removal of unincorporated label (chase). This approach provided much better time resolution of radioactive material within the cell, aiding the detailed characterization of protein migration.
