## What did Porter and Thompson find in tumor cells that was reported by other electron microscope laboratories?

Porter and Thompson found specific particles in tumor cells that were subsequently also observed by other electron microscope laboratories (Cannan & Berger, 1951; Oberling et al., 1950). These particles were found to be limited to tumor cells, suggesting a possible connection to growth processes.

## What was Porter and Kallman's hypothesis regarding the particles found in rapidly growing cells?

Porter and Kallman hypothesized that the particles found in rapidly growing cells, which they termed "growth granules," are linked to the production of new protoplasm. They suggested these particles might contain a large amount of ribonucleotides, indicating they are involved in cytoplasmic multiplication.

## How did Porter and Kallman associate these particles with the microsomal fraction from fractionation studies?

Porter and Kallman, relying on absorption studies with ultraviolet microscopy, concluded the particles found in rapidly growing cells were rich in ribonucleotides. They associated these particles with the microsomal fraction of cells from fractionation studies, suggesting a role in cytoplasmic synthesis.

## What was the significance of the improvement in techniques for making micrographs of thin-sliced cells in the field of cytoplasmic research in the 1940s?

The improvement in techniques for making micrographs of thin-sliced cells allowed for better visualization of cytoplasmic structures, such as the filamentous units noted by Albert Dalton (1951a; Dalton et al., 1950). This advancement led to more detailed observations of cellular components, which had previously been seen predominantly in whole, cultured cells.
