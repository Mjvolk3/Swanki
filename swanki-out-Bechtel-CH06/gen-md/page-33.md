## How did Porter and Kallman describe the endoplasmic reticulum in their papers of 1952 and 1953?

Porter and Kallman described the endoplasmic reticulum as a vesicular or canalicular material within the innermost cytoplasm, termed as the 'endoplasm.' They noted it as a finely divided vacuolar system, which varied in size across different cells depending on the physiological state of the cell at fixation time.

## According to Porter, what did osmium vapor do to the components of the ground substance?

Porter proposed that osmium vapor digested the "diffuse and frequently fibrous components of the ground substance," leaving "what may be thought of as a membrane skeleton of the cell" (Porter & Kallman, 1952, p. 883).

## What technique did Porter and Kallman use to capture images of the lace-like reticulum, and what was its significance?

Porter and Kallman increased the time of fixation in osmium vapors to capture images of the lace-like reticulum. This technique allowed them to provide a more detailed description of the structure, hypothesizing that it constituted a membrane skeleton of the cell, a significant advancement in understanding cell organization.

## What did many investigators propose about the role of microsomes, and how does this relate to mitochondrial research?

Many investigators proposed that microsomes were involved in protein synthesis. This research paralleled the studies on mitochondria, which were revealing mechanisms of oxidative phosphorylation, thus contributing to the comprehensive understanding of various cellular structures and their functions.
