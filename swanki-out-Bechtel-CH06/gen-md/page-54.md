## How did Colvin Redman, Siekevitz, and Palade (1966) demonstrate the transport of newly synthesized proteins?

Colvin Redman, Siekevitz, and Palade (1966) demonstrated the transport of newly synthesized proteins by utilizing $\mathrm{C}^{14}$ labeling in pancreatic microsomes from pigeons. They found that the labeled amylase appeared in the cisternal cavities of the microsome, indicating the movement of the synthesized proteins into these spaces.

## What was demonstrated by treating the ribosome with puromycin according to Redman and Sabatini (1966)?

Redman and Sabatini (1966) demonstrated that treating the ribosome with puromycin resulted in the appearance of labeled unfinished proteins in the cisternal cavities. This showed that "from the onset of protein synthesis the growing peptide chain is directed towards the cisternal space into which it diffuses upon its release from the attached ribosome."

## What role does the large ribosomal subunit play in the transport of newly formed proteins?

Earlier research by Sabatini et al. (1966) demonstrated that the large ribosomal subunit was directly attached to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. This led to the conclusion that the new protein was transported from the large subunit through the membrane to the cisternal space.

## Why did Palade (1974) argue that the endoplasmic reticulum has a complex structure?

Palade (1974) argued that the complex structure of the endoplasmic reticulum can be explained by its role in the vectorial transport of newly formed proteins into the cisternal space. This structural feature is justified by the need to trap proteins produced for export. He noted that aside from $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ accumulation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle fibers, other functions of the endoplasmic reticulum did not directly necessitate a cavitary organ according to current knowledge.
