## What was one of the major unresolved issues regarding ribosomes discussed by Roberts in the symposium introduction?

Roberts highlighted the absence of a suggested mechanism that explained how the structure of the ribosome was compatible with its function as a template for synthesizing long chains of proteins.

## What was Zamecnikâ€™s (1958) proposal about the process of protein synthesis?

Zamecnik proposed that protein synthesis involved an RNA template functioning as a biological equivalent of a printing press, specifying the order in which amino acids are linked. In his scheme, amino acids are first activated by binding with an enzyme and a molecule of ATP, which transfers a phosphate bond to an amino acid. The amino acids then bond sequentially on the RNA template, with bonds being established between adjacent amino acids through a "zipper reaction".

## Describe the initial step involved in Zamecnik's proposed scheme for protein synthesis.

In Zamecnik's scheme, the initial step involves amino acids being activated by binding with an enzyme and a molecule of ATP. This results in the transfer of the phosphate bond to the amino acid, activating it for subsequent reactions.

$$
\text{Amino Acid} + \text{Enzyme} + \text{ATP} \rightarrow \text{Amino Acid-Enzyme-ATP complex}
$$

This activation is crucial for the amino acids to bond sequentially on the RNA template.

## Why was it necessary to move to a lower level of organization in ribosome research?

To uncover the mechanism by which ribosomes synthesized proteins, it was essential to examine the chemical structures comprising the ribosome and their interactions. This decomposition was necessary to understand the specific operations at a biochemical level, which involved disciplines like biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology, rather than cell biology.
