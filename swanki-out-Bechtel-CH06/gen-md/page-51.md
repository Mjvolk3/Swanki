## What were the two main pieces of evidence that Rich used to support the existence of polysomes?

1. Fractionation studies with rabbit reticulocytes.
2. Electron micrographs using metal shadowing and positive staining with uranyl acetate.

## What did the fractionation studies reveal about the presence of polysomes and their role in protein synthesis?

During fractionation studies, ultraviolet absorption characteristic of RNA revealed peaks corresponding to single ribosomes and heavier materials, presumably polysomes. Additionally, labeling amino acids with $\mathrm{C}^{14}$ identified that protein synthesis was occurring in the polysome fraction.

## Explain the difference between the polysome assembly line and a human assembly line as noted by Rich.

In a human assembly line, the product moves down the line and component parts are added to it. Conversely, in the polysome assembly line, ribosomes move down the line and each one makes a complete product.

## What did electron micrographs reveal about the structure and function of polysomes when positively stained with uranyl acetate?

Electron micrographs showed clusters of ribosomes connected by a thread with a diameter of 10 to $15 \AA$, corresponding to a single strand of RNA. This demonstrated the polysome structure and further supported its role in protein synthesis as ribosomes were found to be translocating along this RNA thread.
