## According to Lippman (1946), what two-step scheme is proposed for ATP synthesis along the electron transport chain, similar to glycolysis?

Lippman (1946) proposed the following two-step scheme for ATP synthesis along the electron transport chain:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{AH}_{2}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A} \sim \mathrm{P}+\mathrm{BH}_{2} \\
& \mathrm{~A} \sim \mathrm{P}+\mathrm{ADP} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{ATP} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The overall summary reaction is:

$$
\mathrm{AH}_{2}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{BH}_{2}+\mathrm{ATP} .
$$

- $\mathrm{A}$ denotes a substrate which is oxidized in the first reaction coupled with the reduction of another substrate, $\mathrm{B}$. As $\mathrm{A}$ is oxidized, it forms a high-energy bond with phosphate. In the second reaction, this bond is transferred to ADP, synthesizing ATP.

## According to E.C. Slater (1953), how did the proposed scheme for ATP formation change, and what was the hypothesized new compound?

E.C. Slater (1953) revised Lipmann's proposed scheme by introducing an additional compound, $\mathrm{C}$, that first forms a high-energy bond with $\mathrm{A}$. The reactions are:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{AH}_{2}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{C} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A} \sim \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{BH}_{2} \\
\mathrm{~A} \sim \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{ATP}
\end{gathered}
$$

The overall summary reaction remained:

$$
\mathrm{AH}_{2}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{BH}_{2}+\mathrm{ATP} .
$$

The hypothesized additional compound $\mathrm{C}$ was believed to facilitate the uptake of phosphate into ATP.

## In the derivation of ATP synthesizing reactions, what roles do $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ play, according to the Lippman and Slater models?

In the Lippman and Slater models, $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ have the following roles:

- $\mathrm{A}$: A substrate that is oxidized in the first reaction, forming a high-energy bond with phosphate.
- $\mathrm{B}$: Another substrate that is reduced during the oxidation of $\mathrm{A}$.

In the Lippman model:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{AH}_{2}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} &\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A} \sim \mathrm{P}+\mathrm{BH}_{2} \\
\mathrm{A} \sim \mathrm{P}+\mathrm{ADP} &\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{ATP}
\end{aligned}
$$

In the Slater model:
$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{AH}_{2}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{C} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A} \sim \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{BH}_{2} \\
\mathrm{~A} \sim \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{ATP}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Describe the summary formula that represents the overall effect of the ATP synthesis scheme proposed by Lippman (1946) and Slater (1953).

The overall summary formula representing the effect of ATP synthesis in both schemes (Lippman and Slater) is:

$$
\mathrm{AH}_{2}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{BH}_{2}+\mathrm{ATP} .
$$

- This indicates that $\mathrm{AH}_{2}$ (reduced form of $\mathrm{A}$), $\mathrm{B}$, $\mathrm{ADP}$, and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ are the reactants, and $\mathrm{A}$ (oxidized form of $\mathrm{A}$), $\mathrm{BH}_{2}$ (reduced form of $\mathrm{B}$), and $\mathrm{ATP}$ are the products.
