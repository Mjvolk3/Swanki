## How did Palade and Siekevitz describe the fragmentation process of the endoplasmic reticulum in their study?

Palade and Siekevitz described that preparing the homogenate resulted in “an extensive fragmentation of the networks into independent vesicles, tubules, and cisternae.” These fragments could then be centrifuged down into the homogenate pellets, along with other cell components.

## What was the differentiation made between the microsomes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum?

Palade and Siekevitz identified microsomes as the rough endoplasmic reticulum, noting that microsomes contained small dense particles attached to their limiting membrane. They argued that Claude was correct in treating the microsomes as preformed components of the cytoplasm, but wrong in thinking of them as independent particles. Microsomes are actually parts of a “continuous, cell wide system; i.e., the endoplasmic reticulum.”

## Describe the results obtained by Palade and Siekevitz when treating the microsomal fraction with deoxycholate and versene.

Treatment with deoxycholate eliminated the membrane, leaving the RNA-rich particles, whereas treatment with versene and ribonuclease eliminated the RNA-containing particles, leaving the membrane. This differentiation allowed them to conclude that RNA is found in the particles, while protein, phospholipids, and other components are present in the membrane.

## How did Palade's findings in intestinal epithelium cells support the identification of RNA with the particles?

Palade found “numerous free particles evenly and randomly distributed throughout the cytoplasmic matrix” in developing cells of the intestinal epithelium, independent of the endoplasmic membrane. This contrasted with the endoplasmic reticulum, which appeared with fewer vesicles and tubules, many of them free of attached particles. These observations further supported the idea that RNA is contained within the particles.
