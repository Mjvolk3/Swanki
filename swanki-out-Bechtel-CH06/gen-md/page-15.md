## What did Sjöstrand and Rhodin conclude about the internal structure of mitochondria based on their investigation?

Sjöstrand and Rhodin concluded that mitochondria have an internal structure involving transversally oriented double membranes and a similar outer membrane, suggesting a high degree of organization of these cell organelles.

## How did Sjöstrand describe the inner membranes within mitochondria in his paper with Viggo Hanzon?

Sjöstrand described the inner membranes within mitochondria as densely packed plates mainly oriented perpendicularly to the mitochondrion's long axis. He noted that these membranes also appeared double-edged, with one end in contact with the outer surface membrane, while the other end was mostly free from it.

## According to Sjöstrand, what continuity did he observe between the central space in the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes?

Sjöstrand observed that, with few exceptions, there was no continuity between the central space in the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. Specifically, he noted, "There is with few exceptions no continuity observed between the central space in the inner and outer membranes."

## What were the two major points of disagreement between Sjöstrand and Palade regarding the structure of mitochondria?

The two major points of disagreement between Sjöstrand and Palade regarding the structure of mitochondria were:

1. **Mitochondrial Membrane Layers**: Sjöstrand maintained that the mitochondrial membrane comprised two layers, whereas Palade viewed it as a single layer.
2. **Cristae Structure**: Sjöstrand rejected Palade's claim that cristae were infoldings of the mitochondrial membrane, arguing instead that there were no indications the inner membranes represented folds of a single-edged surface membrane.
