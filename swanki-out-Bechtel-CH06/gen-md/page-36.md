## Why is it significant that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) appears differently in sections of cells in situ compared to whole mounts of tissue-cultured cells?

Palade and Porter argued that the appearance of the ER in sections of tissue-cultured cells should differ from whole mounts because the connections within the ER are severed by the microtome, resulting in vesicles and strands rather than a network.

## What was the purpose of Palade and Porter's (1954) strategy involving tissue-cultured cells?

Palade and Porter aimed to establish legitimacy for using micrographs of whole tissue-cultured cells by comparing them to thin sections, thus demonstrating corresponding structures in both preparations.

## Describe the methodology Palade used to compare the appearance of the endoplasmic reticulum in cells from different tissue types.

Palade compared the appearance of the ER in cells from rats and chickens across various tissue types, including epithelial, nervous, mesenchymal, and muscular. He noted that the ER in cells from living organisms extends from the nuclear membrane to the cell membrane, occurring in both the endoplasm and exoplasm.

## What criticism did Palade and Porter face regarding their micrographs of tissue-cultured cells, and how did they address it?

Critics argued that tissue-cultured cells might exhibit artifacts due to the abnormal environment. Palade and Porter addressed this by preparing thin sections of tissue-cultured cells and comparing them to whole mounts, thus demonstrating structural correspondences and legitimizing their use of micrographs.
