## What was the impact of morphological and biochemical inquiry in cell biology?

Combining morphological and biochemical inquiry resulted in differentiation of component parts and proposals as to the specific operations performed by those parts.

## Discuss the early controversy surrounding the Golgi Apparatus.

In 1949, Claude and Palade challenged the existence of the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that it was an artifact of staining with osmium or other heavy metals.

Eventually, the controversy subsided, and it became widely accepted as a distinct cell organelle involved in various cellular activities. By 1981, Palade and Marilyn Farquhar stated that no one questioned its existence or relevance anymore.

## Who were the major contributors to the Golgi apparatus' validation and what was their role?

Despite initially challenging its existence, Palade contributed much to the validation of the Golgi apparatus by providing crucial information about its function. Alongside Marilyn Farquhar, Palade wrote reviews affirming the significance and authenticity of the Golgi Apparatus.

## What were the challenges in visualizing the Golgi apparatus during the early research period?

The Golgi apparatus was controversial because it was not visible in living cells, and its visualization relied on Golgi's heavy-metal staining method (la reazione nera), which was difficult to reproduce reliably and often stained many other structures.
