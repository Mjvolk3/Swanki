## What were the three primary components of Sjöstrand's continuing research as identified in his application to the Rockefeller Foundation?

The three primary components of Sjöstrand's continuing research were:
1. The structural basis of irritability in sensory cells.
2. Thin sectioning
3. Fixing cells for electron microscopy

## Explain Sjöstrand's contribution to the development of thin sectioning for electron microscopy. Include specific details about his microtome's design and capabilities.

Sjöstrand developed his own microtome which included:
- An eccentrically located tissue mount rotating 60 times per minute.
- The mount was advanced by a thermally expanding column behind the eccentric wheel.
- This design allowed him to cut sections as thin as $70 \AA$ on a regular basis.

## What specific advancements did Sjöstrand learn about during his visit to the Rockefeller laboratory in 1952?

During his visit to the Rockefeller laboratory in 1952, Sjöstrand learned about:
- Palade's new buffered osmium fixative.

## How did Schmitt's assessment of Sjöstrand's capabilities change between 1950 and 1952, and what were his final evaluations?

In 1950, Schmitt had a mixed impression of Sjöstrand, noting his competence but doubting his potential for making brilliant advances. By 1952, Schmitt's assessment was more positive:
- Sjöstrand was viewed as a sound scientist with the patience necessary for developing complicated techniques required for electron microscopy.
