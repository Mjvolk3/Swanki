## Explain the localization of enzyme complexes I and II based on biochemical considerations.

Enzyme complexes I and II must interact with DPNH and succinate, respectively, both of which are localized in the interior of the crista.

%

The interior of the crista provides a necessary environment for these interactions due to the presence of DPNH and succinate. As stated in the paper, "Complexes I and II must interact with DPNH and succinate, respectively, both of which are localized in the interior of the crista." This localization is critical for the efficient functioning of these complexes in electron transport.

## What speculative proposal did Green attribute to Robert Bock and Robert Criddle in Scientific American 1964?

The speculative proposal by Green, attributed to Robert Bock and Robert Criddle, suggested that the transport of substrates between enzymes was accomplished by "means of swinging groups of atoms, mounted on the respective proteins by flexible arms, that transfer and accept the electrons."

%

Green offered this proposal to address the issue of electron transport between enzymes. This method hypothesized the existence of flexible arms on proteins that could effectively transfer and accept electrons as needed, even though it did not address the accompanying phosphorylation.

## What technique did Racker, Parsons, and Chance use to examine F_o preparations, and what did they find?

Racker, Parsons, and Chance used the negative staining technique to examine $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{o}}$ preparations and found that they were sac-shaped structures covered with "inner membrane spheres."

%

By employing the negative staining technique, Racker and his collaborators observed that $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{o}}$ preparations displayed sac-like structures adorned with inner membrane spheres similar to those found by Fernández-Morán. These structures indicated potential locations for enzymatic activity.

## How did Racker conclude that spheres contained ATPase and were the locus of ATP synthesis?

Racker concluded that the spheres contained ATPase and were the locus of ATP synthesis after observing spheres about $85 \AA \degree$ in diameter in $F_{1}$ factor preparations and noting phosphorylation was restored when $\mathrm{F}_{2}$, $\mathrm{F}_{3}$, and $\mathrm{F}_{4}$ were added to the trypsin-urea membrane preparation.

%

Racker's research indicated that the presence and addition of $F_{1}$, $F_{2}$, $F_{3}$, and $F_{4}$ factors were essential for restoring phosphorylation in the membrane preparation. The diameter of the spheres ($85 \AA \degree$) correlated with the ATPase structure, thus leading to the conclusion that these spheres were the loci of ATP synthesis.
