## What was the main conclusion Neutra and Leblond reached about the Golgi apparatus and its role in glycoprotein formation?

Neutra and Leblond concluded that the Golgi apparatus synthesizes glycoproteins by combining glucose or galactose precursors with proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum.

## Describe the structure and function of the goblet cell as studied by Leblond. Mention the stages and regions of the Golgi apparatus as defined in the studies.

Leblond's studies on goblet cells described them as long, narrow structures with several Golgi stacks, where the cis saccules were flattened and the trans saccules were bulging with material. Glucose tracers moved from the cisternae to the cisterna, where they were converted into mucigen granules.

## Why did the recognition of the Golgi apparatus' significance change in the 1960s, and what technological advances contributed to this shift?

In the 1960s, the Golgi apparatus was recognized as a major cellular component due to better imaging from electron microscopes and evidence of its functional role in creating secretion products.
