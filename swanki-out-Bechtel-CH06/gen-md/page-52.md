## What did Rich propose regarding the movement of ribosomes along the messenger RNA?

Rich proposed that the ribosomes move along the messenger RNA, adding the appropriate amino acid to the polypeptide chain it was constructing according to the instruction at that locus on the chain. He hypothesized a "ratchet-like mechanism" for this movement.

## Describe the ratchet-like mechanism proposed by Rich for ribosome movement along the mRNA.

Rich's "ratchet-like mechanism" refers to a theoretical model where ribosomes progress along the messenger RNA in a step-by-step manner, guided by the mRNA's instructions, ensuring the correct amino acid is added to the polypeptide chain.

## Based on the image description, what biological process is depicted by the electron micrograph of large polyribosomes from E. coli?

The electron micrograph of large polyribosomes from $E. coli$ depicts the synthesis of $\beta$-galactosidase, showing ribosomes attached along a strand of messenger RNA.

## What was the significant finding of Slayter et al. (1968) regarding bacterial polyribosomes as shown in Figure 6.12 of the paper?

Slayter et al. (1968) conducted an electron microscopic study revealing the structure of large bacterial polyribosomes engaged in synthesizing proteins like $\beta$-galactosidase in E. coli.
