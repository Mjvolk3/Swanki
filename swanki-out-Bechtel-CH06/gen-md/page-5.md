## Explain the role of proton gradient in oxidative phosphorylation.
Oxidative phosphorylation depends on the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. How is the energy used to drive oxidative phosphorylation stored?

The energy used to drive oxidative phosphorylation is stored in a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, not in a chemical intermediate.

## Which molecules are involved in the oxidation of fatty acids catalyzed by the complex enzyme system in ordinary liver preparations?
List the pathways and the end products of fatty acid oxidation in the liver.

The complex enzyme system in ordinary liver preparations catalyzes the oxidation of fatty acids via two possible pathways: 

1. Producing ketone bodies such as acetoacetate (acetoacetic acid).
2. Proceeding through the citric acid cycle and respiratory chain, producing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and consuming oxygen to generate $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

## How did Schneider’s initial experiments differ from later experiments by Kennedy and Lehninger in terms of oxidation of fatty acids?
Describe the setup and findings of Schneider’s initial experiments and contrast them with the findings of Kennedy and Lehninger.

Schneider’s initial experiments used water and saline suspensions of mitochondrial fractions with octanoate and necessary supplementary substances ($\mathrm{KCl}$, $\mathrm{MgSO}_4$, a "sparking” Krebs intermediate, cytochrome $c$, phosphate buffer, ATP) but found no significant oxidation. Whereas, Kennedy and Lehninger used $0.88 \mathrm{M}$ sucrose as the fractionation medium and observed oxidation in the mitochondrial fraction.

## What was Lehninger's contribution to understanding mitochondrial function?
Summarize Lehninger's experiments and conclusions regarding the oxidation of octanoate in mitochondrial fractions.

Lehninger, along with his student Kennedy, demonstrated that the oxidation of the fatty acid octanoate occurred in the mitochondrial fraction when $0.88 \mathrm{M}$ sucrose was used as the fractionation medium. This was a crucial step in identifying the role of mitochondria in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation.
