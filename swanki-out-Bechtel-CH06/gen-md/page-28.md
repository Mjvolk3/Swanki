### Card 1

#### What were the three proposals for the significance of spherical particles on the mitochondrial inner membrane according to Figure 6.7?

1. Green's 1963 proposal suggested that each inner membrane sphere contained an entire electron transport chain (ETC).
2. Green's revised proposal distributed the complexes into a tripartite repeating unit: 
   - Complexes I and II in the base piece
   - Complex III in the stalk
   - Complex IV in the head piece
3. Racker's account localized ATPase in the inner membrane spheres and the ETC in the inner membrane itself.

### Card 2

#### What was Green's initial hypothesis in 1963 regarding the inner membrane spheres, and how did it change in his revised proposal?

Initially, Green hypothesized that each inner membrane sphere contained an entire electron transport chain (ETC). However, this hypothesis was revised to the idea that the ETC complexes were distributed in a tripartite repeating unit:
- Complexes I and II were contained in the base piece.
- Complex III was in the stalk.
- Complex IV was in the head piece.

### Card 3

#### According to Lehninger (1964), what was the major quantitative issue with Green's 1963 proposal about the inner membrane spheres containing the entire ETC?

Lehninger calculated that the weight of the respiratory assembly was one to two orders of magnitude greater than that of the inner membrane spheres. This creates a significant discrepancy, suggesting that the entire ETC could not be contained within these spherical particles as initially proposed by Green.

### Card 4

#### What structural feature did Fernández-Morán observe in mitochondria after applying negative stains without prior fixation, and what was the estimated number of these features per mitochondrion?

Fernández-Morán observed small spherical knobs, about 90 Å in diameter, studding sheets, tubules, or ribbons of extruded membranous material after the mitochondria swelled and burst. The estimated number of these spherical particles ranged from 10,000 to 100,000 per mitochondrion.
