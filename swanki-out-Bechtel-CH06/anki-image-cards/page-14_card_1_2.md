Sjöstrand and Rhodin's micrograph reveals internal membranes within the mitochondria, which they interpreted as separate structures that are discontinuous with both the outer mitochondrial membrane and each other. This finding highlights the high degree of organization within mitochondria observable with advanced electron microscopy techniques.
