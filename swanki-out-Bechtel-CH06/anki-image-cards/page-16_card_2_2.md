## What does the image represent regarding the internal structure of mitochondria?

The image contrasts two interpretations of the internal structure of mitochondria:
- **Top row**: 3D models
  - **Left**: Palade's 3D model, showing cristae as infoldings of the inner membrane and the mitochondrial matrix as a central free channel.
  - **Right**: Sjöstrand's 3D model, showing double-layered membranes as distinct structures, not foldings of the inner membrane.
- **Bottom row**: 2D medial longitudinal sections reflecting the 3D models above.
This highlights the historical scientific debate between Palade's and Sjöstrand's views on mitochondrial structure.

## What are the key differences between Palade's and Sjöstrand's models of mitochondrial structure?

The key differences between the two models are:
- **Palade's Model**:
  - **Cristae**: Depicted as infoldings of the inner membrane.
  - **Mitochondrial Matrix**: Central free channel.
- **Sjöstrand's Model**:
  - **Cristae**: Double-layered membranes that are distinct and individual structures, not foldings of the inner membrane.

These differences reflect the historical debate on whether cristae are part of the inner membrane or separate structures with topographic relationships to the outer membrane.
