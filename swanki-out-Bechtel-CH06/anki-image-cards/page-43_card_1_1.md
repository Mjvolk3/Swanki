The creation of peptide bonds in proteins involves the following basic steps:

- Two amino acids come together, with their respective structures featuring an amino group (NH2), a central carbon (C), a hydrogen atom (H), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
- A reaction takes place where a water molecule (H2O) is removed.
- The bond forms between the amino group of one amino acid and the carboxyl group of another amino acid, leading to a peptide bond (C-N linking the two amino acids).

### Describe the structure of a generic amino acid and explain how glycine and alanine bond together.

A generic amino acid structure includes:

- A central (alpha) carbon atom (C)
- An amino group (-NH2)
- A carboxylic acid group (-COOH)
- A hydrogen atom (H)
- An R group, which varies among different amino acids

For glycine and alanine to bond together:

- Glycine (left) consists of an -NH2 group, an alpha carbon with two hydrogen atoms, and a -COOH group.
- Alanine (right) has an -NH2 group, an alpha carbon bound to a methyl group (CH3), a hydrogen atom, and a -COOH group.
- During peptide bond formation, a water molecule (H2O) is removed, and the amino group of glycine bonds with the carboxylic acid group of alanine, forming a peptide bond between them.
