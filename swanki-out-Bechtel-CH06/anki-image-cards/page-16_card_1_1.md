The two 3D interpretations of the mitochondrial structure shown in Figure 6.3 are:

1. **Palade's interpretation**: Presented as a wax model on the left, Palade's depiction of the mitochondrial structure emphasizes the central free channel or mitochondrial matrix, denoted as \( f_c \).

2. **Sjöstrand's interpretation**: Illustrated on the right, Sjöstrand's version of the mitochondrial structure represents a different organizational layout of the internal membranes and compartments within the mitochondrion.

### How do Palade's and Sjöstrand's models differ in terms of the internal structure of mitochondria?

Palade's model of the mitochondria, depicted through a wax structure, emphasizes a central free channel referred to as the mitochondrial matrix. This contrasts with Sjöstrand's model, which offers a different depiction of the internal membrane organization and compartments within the mitochondrion. The primary difference lies in how each scientist conceptualizes the spatial arrangement and connectivity of the inner mitochondrial structures.
