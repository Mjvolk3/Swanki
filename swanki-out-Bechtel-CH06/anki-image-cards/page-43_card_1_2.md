The basic steps illustrated involve:
- Representation of the generic structure of an amino acid with the variable $\mathrm{R}$ group.
- The bonding of glycine and alanine through the removal of a water molecule to form a peptide bond.

The molecular structure shows:
- On the left: Glycine with a hydrogen (H) atom attached to nitrogen (N), bonded to carbon (C), which is double-bonded to an oxygen (O) atom.
- In the middle: A peptide bond (dotted box) connecting glycine and alanine.
- On the right: Alanine with a central carbon atom bonded to another carbon with three hydrogen atoms (CH3), a hydrogen atom, an amino group (NH), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
