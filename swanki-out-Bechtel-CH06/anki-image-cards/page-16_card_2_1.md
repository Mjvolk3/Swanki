Describe the differences between Palade's and Sjöstrand's interpretations of the internal structure of mitochondria as shown in the image.

%

Palade's interpretation (left) suggests that mitochondria have a central free channel, known as the mitochondrial matrix, with cristae as infoldings of the inner membrane. In contrast, Sjöstrand's model (right) depicts double-layered membranes traversing the mitochondrion without forming folds of the inner membrane (cristae), treating them as distinct structures with only topographic relations to the outer membrane.

## Historical scientific debate on mitochondrial structure

What historical debate does the contrasting interpretation of the mitochondrial structure reflect according to the image and associated text?

%

The contrasting interpretations reflect the historical scientific debate between Palade and Sjöstrand regarding the internal organization of mitochondria. This debate focused on whether the cristae are infoldings of the inner membrane (Palade's view) or distinct structures in themselves (Sjöstrand's view).
