The micrograph by F. Sjöstrand and V. Hanzon shows paired intracellular membranes with small opaque particles attached on one side of each membrane. Additionally, a mitochondrion is visible at the bottom of the image. This image is significant for its contribution to understanding cellular mechanisms and enzyme synthesis in exocrine pancreas cells.
