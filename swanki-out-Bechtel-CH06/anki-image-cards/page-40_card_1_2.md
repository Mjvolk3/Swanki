Figure 6.10 depicts paired intracellular membranes with small opaque particles attached on one side of each membrane. At the bottom of the micrograph, a mitochondrion is visible. This image, captured by electron microscopists F. S. Sjöstrand and V. Hanzon in 1954, significantly contributed to the understanding of cellular mechanisms, such as enzyme synthesis in exocrine pancreas cells.
