The three key stages of cellular respiration and their locations are:
1. Glycolysis: Occurs in the cytosol.
2. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle): Occurs in the mitochondrial matrix.
3. Electron Transport Chain and Oxidative Phosphorylation: Occurs in the cristae (inner mitochondrial membrane).

## Describe the role of NADH and FADH2 in the electron transport chain as depicted in the diagram.

In the electron transport chain, NADH and FADH2 are responsible for donating electrons. These electrons travel through the chain and their energy is used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient drives ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation.
