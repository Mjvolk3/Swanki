The illustration by de Duve and Wattriaux (1966) presents a schematic representation of the lysosomal system for eliminating cellular waste products. It depicts two main pathways, heterophagy (material entering the cell from without) and autophagy (material from within the cell), both having three phases. The left side shows "pre-lysosomes," including endocytic vesicles and autophagic vesicles. These merge with primary lysosomes containing acid hydrolases to form secondary lysosomes, where digestion and absorption occur. Undigested material is then packaged into "residual bodies" that can undergo excretion, defecation, and secretion.

## What structures are involved in the lysosomal system's heterophagy and autophagy processes according to the schematic representation by de Duve and Wattriaux (1966)?

In heterophagy and autophagy, the structures involved include:

1. Pre-lysosomes: Endocytic vesicles or old cell parts in autophagic vesicles.
2. Primary lysosomes: Contain acid hydrolases.
3. Secondary lysosomes: Formed by merging with primary lysosomes where digestion and absorption occur.
4. Residual bodies: Contain undigested material packaged for excretion, defecation, or secretion.

Arrows in the schematic indicate the process directions such as endocytosis, regurgitation, diffusion, and secretion.
