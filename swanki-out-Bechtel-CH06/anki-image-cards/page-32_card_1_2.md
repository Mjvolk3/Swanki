In Peter Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis for oxidative phosphorylation, the proton gradient is established by the active transport of protons (H+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space. This process is driven by energy released from electrons moving through the electron transport chain, originating from the citric acid cycle. The difference in proton concentration across the inner membrane creates what is known as the proton motive force, which stores potential energy.

In Peter Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis for oxidative phosphorylation, ATP synthase plays a crucial role in synthesizing ATP from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This process is driven by the flow of protons (H+) back into the mitochondrial matrix through ATP synthase, utilizing the energy stored in the proton gradient created across the inner mitochondrial membrane.
