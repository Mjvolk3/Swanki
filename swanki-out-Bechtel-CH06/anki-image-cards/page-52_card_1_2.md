In the provided electron micrograph, large polyribosomes from E. coli synthesizing $\beta$-galactosidase are shown. The dark spots represent ribosomes, which are the molecular machines that synthesize proteins by translating genetic information from mRNA. The thread-like structure connecting the ribosomes is likely the mRNA strand they are reading and translating.
