The schematic representation by de Duve and Wattriaux (1966) illustrates the lysosomal system involved in eliminating cellular waste products through two main processes: heterophagy and autophagy. 

- **Heterophagy**: Material entering the cell from outside is incorporated into endocytic vesicles, forming phagosomes.
- **Autophagy**: Old cell parts are incorporated into autophagic vesicles.
Both processes involve three phases: 
1. Formation of pre-lysosomes from endocytic vesicles or cellular parts.
2. Fusion with primary lysosomes containing acid hydrolases to form secondary lysosomes.
3. Digestion of material within secondary lysosomes. 

Residual bodies form undigested materials, which can undergo mixed excretion, defecation, or secretion.

## What are the main phases in the lysosomal system as represented by de Duve and Wattriaux (1966)?

The main phases in the lysosomal system are:

1. **Pre-lysosome Formation**:
   - For heterophagy: Endocytic vesicles form phagosomes.
   - For autophagy: Old cell parts form autophagic vesicles.
2. **Primary Lysosome Fusion**:
   - Pre-lysosomes fuse with primary lysosomes containing acid hydrolases.
3. **Secondary Lysosome Formation and Digestion**:
   - The fusion results in secondary lysosomes where digestion and absorption occur. 
4. **Residual Bodies**:
   - Undigested materials are packaged into residual bodies which can undergo mixed excretion, defecation, or secretion.
