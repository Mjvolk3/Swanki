The schematic representation depicts the process of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria based on Peter Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis. Key features include:
- Outer membrane
- Intermembrane space
- Inner membrane
- Matrix
- Electron transport chain
- Proton pump
- Proton gradient
- Proton motive force
- ATP synthesis

The arrows indicate temporally ordered energy transfers with varying widths to denote energy gain or expenditure.

## Question 2

How does the diagram use arrow widths to represent energy transfers in Peter Mitchellâ€™s chemiosmotic hypothesis for oxidative phosphorylation?

The diagram uses arrows of varying widths to denote temporally ordered energy transfers. An increasing width of an arrow indicates energy gain, whereas a decreasing width signifies energy expenditure. This helps in conceptualizing the energy dynamics during the oxidative phosphorylation process.
