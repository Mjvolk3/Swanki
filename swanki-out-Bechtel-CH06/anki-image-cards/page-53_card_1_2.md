Polyribosomes, or polysomes, are complexes of multiple ribosomes attached to a single strand of messenger RNA (mRNA). They facilitate the simultaneous synthesis of multiple polypeptide chains. In the provided image, the leftmost ribosome has just begun forming a polypeptide chain, whereas each subsequent ribosome, moving rightward, has produced progressively longer chains, culminating with the rightmost ribosome having formed the longest chain. This illustrates the translation process, where ribosomes translate genetic information from mRNA into sequences of amino acids to form proteins.

## What does the rightmost ribosome in the image signify about its state in the translation process?

The rightmost ribosome signifies that it is in an advanced stage of the translation process, as it has produced a fairly long polypeptide chain. This indicates that it has been attached to the mRNA for a longer duration compared to the other ribosomes shown in the image.
