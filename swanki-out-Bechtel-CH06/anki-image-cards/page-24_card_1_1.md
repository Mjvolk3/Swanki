1. Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol, converting glucose to pyruvate with a net production of 2 ATP molecules and reduction of NAD+ to NADH.
2. The Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle) takes place in the mitochondrial matrix, processing pyruvate (after conversion to acetyl CoA) to produce CO2, ATP, and reducing NAD+ to NADH and FAD to FADH2.
3. The Electron Transport Chain is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane (cristae), using electrons from NADH and FADH2 to pump protons, creating a gradient that drives ATP synthesis (oxidative phosphorylation), yielding approximately 34 ATP molecules.

## In cellular respiration, where does the citric acid cycle occur and what are its main outputs?

The citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. Its main outputs are:
- CO2
- ATP
- Reduced coenzymes: NADH and FADH2
