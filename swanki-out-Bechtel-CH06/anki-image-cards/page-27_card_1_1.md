Figure 6.6 showcases an electron micrograph by Fern치ndez-Mor치n, revealing small spherical particles attached to the inner membrane of mitochondria. These particles are inner membrane spheres that protrude from the cristae on thin stalks. The spherical knobs visible in the inset represent mitochondrial ATPase complexes.
