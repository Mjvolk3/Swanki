Lehninger's conception illustrates the coupling of the electron transport chain with oxidative phosphorylation via high-energy intermediates. The diagram shows three different enzymes (denoted as $\mathrm{X}$, $\mathrm{Y}$, and $\mathrm{Z}$), inorganic phosphate ($\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$), and substances acting as carriers undergoing reversible oxidation-reduction reactions. The process involves the sequential transport of electrons through various carriers like cytochrome b (CYT b), cytochrome c (CYT c), and a truncated cytochrome oxidase (CYT O to CYT O3), culminating in the synthesis of ATP from ADP and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$. The final electron acceptor is molecular oxygen, leading to the formation of water. The high-energy bonds (denoted by $\sim$) play a critical role in the ATP synthesis process.

## What role do high-energy intermediates play in the diagram of the electron transport chain according to Lehninger's conception?

High-energy intermediates, represented by a tilde ($\sim$), are crucial in the process of ATP synthesis. They act as essential intermediates in the coupling of the electron transport chain to oxidative phosphorylation, transferring energy released during electron transport to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate ($\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$).
