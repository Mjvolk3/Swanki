What are the key differences in the appearance of the endoplasmic reticulum between whole tissue-cultured cells and thin sections as illustrated in the micrographs?

%

The key differences are as follows:
- In whole tissue-cultured cells (top micrograph), the endoplasmic reticulum appears as discrete and cross-sectional details, showing canaliculi and vesicles in the cytoplasm.
- In thin sections (bottom micrograph), the endoplasmic reticulum presents as a continuous network-like structure, indicating a more extensive organization within the glandular epithelia of the parotid of a newborn rat.

What is the significance of using both whole tissue-cultured cells and thin sections in studying cell structures as demonstrated in the micrographs?

%

The significance lies in demonstrating that the cellular structures observed, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, are consistent across different types of cell preparations. This suggests that these structures are not artifacts of the tissue culture process but are genuine components of the cell, thus validating the findings obtained from such microscopy studies.
