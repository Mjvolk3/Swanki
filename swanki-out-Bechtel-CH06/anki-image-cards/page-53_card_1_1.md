The translation process, as illustrated by the polyribosome schematic, involves multiple ribosomes attached to a single strand of messenger RNA (mRNA). Each ribosome translates the genetic information from the mRNA into a polypeptide chain (protein). The schematic shows the leftmost ribosome just beginning to form a polypeptide chain, while the rightmost ribosome has synthesized a significantly longer chain. This indicates the step-by-step elongation of polypeptide chains as the ribosomes move along the mRNA.

## What is the function of ribosomes in the translation process as shown in the image?

Ribosomes function as the molecular machines that facilitate the translation process by moving along the messenger RNA (mRNA), decoding its genetic information, and synthesizing polypeptide chains (proteins). The image shows a polyribosome with five ribosomes attached to the mRNA, each at different stages of forming a polypeptide chain, thereby demonstrating simultaneous, efficient protein synthesis.
