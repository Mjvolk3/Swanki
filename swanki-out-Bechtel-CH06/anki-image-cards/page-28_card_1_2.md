Green's 1963 proposal suggested that each inner membrane sphere contained an entire electron transport chain (ETC). In contrast, Green's revised proposal described a tripartite repeating unit where complexes I and II of the ETC were located in the base piece, complex III in the stalk, and complex IV in the head piece.

## What does Racker's 1965 proposal suggest about the localization of ATPase and the electron transport chain (ETC) on the mitochondrial inner membrane?

Racker's 1965 proposal suggests that ATPase is localized in the spherical particles on the mitochondrial inner membrane, while the electron transport chain (ETC) is distributed along the inner membrane itself.
