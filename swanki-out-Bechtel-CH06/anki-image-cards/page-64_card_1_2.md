The electron micrograph shows lysosomes indicated by dense bodies, marked with arrows. The "ER" label points to microsomal membranes, likely from the endoplasmic reticulum, containing smaller granules than the lysosomes. "MT" denotes a mitochondrion, which is not well-preserved in the image.

## What does the label "ER" indicate in the electron micrograph of lysosome fraction from rat liver?

The "ER" label points to microsomal membranes that are presumably from the endoplasmic reticulum. These membranes contain granules that are much smaller than the dense bodies identified as lysosomes.
