The diagram showcases three distinct proposals:

1. **Green's 1963 Proposal**: Each inner membrane sphere contains an entire electron transport chain (ETC).
2. **Green's Revised Proposal**: A tripartite repeating unit where:
    - Complexes I and II are in the base piece
    - Complex III is in the stalk
    - Complex IV is in the head piece
3. **Racker's Proposal**: Localization of ATPase in the spheres with the electron transport chain distributed along the inner membrane.

The first image depicting the micrograph of the mitochondrion's inner structure was likely taken using the **negative-staining electron microscopy technique**.
