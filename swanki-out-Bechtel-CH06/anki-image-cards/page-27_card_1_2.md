The electron micrograph reveals small spherical particles, known as inner membrane spheres, attached to the mitochondrial inner membrane. These particles are visible protruding from the cristae (inner membrane folds) on thin stalks, indicative of mitochondrial ATPase complexes.

The small spherical particles attached to the inner membrane of mitochondria, as shown in Fernández-Morán’s micrograph, represent mitochondrial ATPase complexes. These spherical knobs contribute to understanding the morphology related to ATP synthesis mechanisms within the mitochondrion.
