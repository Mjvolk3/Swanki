The electron micrograph in Figure 6.15 illustrates a lysosome fraction from a rat liver. The dense bodies indicated by arrows are presumed to be lysosomes. The label "ER" designates microsomal membranes, presumably from the endoplasmic reticulum, and the "MT" label designates a mitochondrion, which is noted as not being well-preserved.

## What are the dense bodies indicated by arrows in the electron micrograph, and how do they compare to the granules within the microsomal membranes?

The dense bodies indicated by arrows in the electron micrograph are presumed to be lysosomes. They are larger than the granules within the microsomal membranes, which are presumably from the endoplasmic reticulum.
