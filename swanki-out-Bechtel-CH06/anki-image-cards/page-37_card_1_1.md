### Card 1

What structures are compared in the micrographs presented by Palade and Porter, and what differences do they highlight about the endoplasmic reticulum?

The micrographs compare the appearance of the endoplasmic reticulum in whole tissue-cultured cells (top) and in thin sections (bottom). The top micrograph shows detailed structures such as canaliculi and vesicles within the cytoplasm, while the bottom image presents the endoplasmic reticulum as a continuous, network-like structure. These comparisons illustrate that the observed cellular components are consistent across different cell preparation methods, confirming their genuine nature.

### Card 2

What is the significance of the annotations such as t1, t2, c1, and n in the micrographs?

Annotations like t1, t2, c1 in the top micrograph and n in the bottom micrograph likely refer to various parts and structures within the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum. These labels help identify specific elements associated with the reticulum or other cellular structures, aiding in the detailed study of cellular morphology and confirming the structural consistency across different cell preparation methods.
