Lehninger's conception involves the coupling of the electron transport chain (ETC) with oxidative phosphorylation through high-energy intermediates. Enzymes $\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{Y}$, and $\mathrm{Z}$ facilitate the sequential transport of electrons via various carriers, leading to the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate ($\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$). High-energy bonds, represented by a tilde ($\sim$), are crucial in this ATP synthesis process, with the final electron acceptor being molecular oxygen, forming water.

High-energy intermediates, indicated by a tilde ($\sim$), play a crucial role in coupling the electron transport chain (ETC) with ATP synthesis. These intermediates store and transfer energy generated during electron transport through various redox reactions. This stored energy is then used to drive the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP, ensuring efficient energy conversion and transfer within the cell.
