ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is an electron micrograph of a lysosome fraction from a rat liver. The dense bodies indicated by arrows are presumed to be lysosomes. The label "ER" points to microsomal membranes which are believed to be part of the endoplasmic reticulum; the granules within these membranes are smaller than the lysosomes. The label "MT" designates a mitochondrion, which is noted as not being well-preserved in the micrograph. This image is used to illustrate the findings from biochemical research on the cellular organelles known as lysosomes.
