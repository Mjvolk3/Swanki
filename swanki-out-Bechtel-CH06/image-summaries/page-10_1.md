ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows three electron micrographs numbered 7, 8, and 9, displaying the internal structure of mitochondria as observed by G. E. Palade in 1952. These micrographs reveal the cristae, which are ridges or infoldings of the mitochondrial inner membrane. These cristae were identified by Palade as a key structural component of mitochondria and were considered critical to the organelle's function, particularly in relation to the oxidative processes that take place within mitochondria. The cristae are denoted by the markings 'm,' 'm1,' 'm2,' and 'm3' in the images, and the scale bars located at the bottom left of images 8 and 9 indicate the size of the structures, with the lengths of 0.1 micrometer (µm) and 1 µm, respectively.
