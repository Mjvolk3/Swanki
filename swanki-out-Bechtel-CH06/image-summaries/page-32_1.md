ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a schematic representation of Peter Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis for oxidative phosphorylation within a mitochondrion. The diagram illustrates the process by which energy is transferred through a series of reactions and components.

Key features labeled in the diagram include:

- Outer membrane: The outer boundary of the mitochondrion.
- Intermembrane space: The space between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes.
- Inner membrane: The selectively permeable membrane where the electron transport chain is located.
- Matrix: The interior space of the mitochondrion enclosed by the inner membrane.
- Electron transport: Depicts electrons from the citric acid cycle moving through the electron transport chain.
- Proton pump: Shows the active transport of protons (H+) across the inner membrane into the intermembrane space.
- Proton gradient: The difference in proton concentration across the inner membrane.
- Proton motive force: The potential energy stored in the proton gradient.
- ATP Synthesis: The process of converting ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and free phosphate (Pi) into ATP (adenosine triphosphate) driven by the flow of protons back into the matrix through ATP synthase, utilizing the energy from the proton gradient.

The diagram uses arrows of varying widths to represent temporally ordered energy transfers, with the increasing width suggesting energy gain and the decreasing width indicating energy spent. This is a conceptual illustration and does not represent the actual spatial relations of the components.
