ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image represents a schematic diagram of cellular respiration processes within a eukaryotic cell, particularly highlighting the biochemical mechanisms in different parts of the cell. It shows glycolysis occurring in the cytosol, converting glucose to pyruvate with a net production of 2 ATP molecules and the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. 

In the mitochondrial matrix, the diagram depicts the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), which processes the pyruvate from glycolysis (after its conversion to acetyl CoA) to produce CO2, ATP, and further reduce NAD+ to NADH and FAD to FADH2.

Finally, the electron transport chain shown on the inner mitochondrial membrane (the cristae) uses the electrons from NADH and FADH2 to pump protons across the membrane, creating a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis (oxidative phosphorylation) resulting in a yield of approximately 34 ATP molecules.

Overall, the diagram visualizes the three key stages of cellular respiration, demonstrating where each process takes place within the cell and indicating the energy yield in the form of ATP.
