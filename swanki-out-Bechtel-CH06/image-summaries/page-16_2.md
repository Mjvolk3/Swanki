ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows two contrasting interpretations of the internal structure of the mitochondrion represented as 3D models (top) and as 2D medial longitudinal sections (bottom). The two renderings represent the differing views of Sjöstrand and Palade on the internal organization of the mitochondria. The left side depicts Palade's model, which has been proposed to have a central free channel (later referred to as the mitochondrial matrix), and appears to show cristae as infoldings of the inner membrane. The right side shows Sjöstrand's model, with double-layered membranes traversing the mitochondrion, which he argued were distinct and individual structures not forming folds of the outer membrane. Palade's interpretation includes the cristae as infoldings of the inner membrane, while Sjöstrand's interpretation sees the cristae as individual structures with only topographic relations to the outer membrane. This reflects the historical scientific debate on mitochondrial structure.
