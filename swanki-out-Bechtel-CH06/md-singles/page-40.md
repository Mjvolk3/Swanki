Figure 6.10. Sjöstrand and Hanzon's micrograph of paired intracellular membranes with small opaque particles attached on one side of each membrane. At the bottom a mitochondrion is shown. Reproduced from F. S. Sjöstrand and V. Hanzon (1954), Membrane structure of cytoplasm and mitochondria in exocrine cells of mouse pancreas as revealed by high resolution electron microscopy, Experimental Cell Research, 7, 393-414, Figure 3, p. 397, with permission of Elsevier.

face the mitochondria, the zymogen granules and the cell membrane with their rough side but the cytoplasmic membranes adjacent to the nuclear membrane always have the smooth surface directed towards the nuclear membrane. Therefore at least one of the membranes appears to be a single membrane. (Sjöstrand \& Hanzon, 1954, pp. 403-4)
