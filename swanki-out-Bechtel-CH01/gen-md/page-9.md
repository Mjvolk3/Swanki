## Explain how academic departments play a role in shaping scientific disciplines. 

Academic departments are critical to shaping scientific disciplines because they function as political institutions that sustain the continuity of a discipline by training subsequent generations and securing their cognitive and social allegiances. Richard Whitley emphasized the role of educational institutions in forming the basic commitments of scientists and constituting their social and cognitive identity.

## How do professional societies and journals differ from academic departments in their roles within scientific disciplines?

Professional societies and journals differ from academic departments in that they do not serve as the primary training ground for new scientists. Instead, they contribute to the intellectual infrastructure by facilitating scholarly communication, peer review, and professional networking. These institutions demarcate academic territories and ensure the cognitive and social unity of the discipline.

## Discuss the stance of some philosophers on acknowledging social factors in science and its epistemic warrant.

Some philosophers, such as Laudan (1981) and Kitcher (2001), argue that acknowledging social factors in the development of science undermines its epistemic warrant. They believe that considering social influences detracts from the objectivity and reliability of scientific findings. Conversely, other philosophers like Longino (1990) and Solomon (2001) propose that social factors can be integrated into the intellectual development of science without sacrificing its epistemic warrant.

## Why are academic departments considered problematic for tracking scientific disciplines in universities?

Academic departments are considered problematic for tracking scientific disciplines because their organization often depends on local politics and administrative conveniences, rather than on clear distinctions between disciplines. This can result in discrepancies between how universities structure departments and how professional societies and journals define disciplines, especially in the biological sciences.
