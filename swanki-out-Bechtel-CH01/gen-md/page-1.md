## 1. Explain why cell biology was misunderstood in its early days as a straightforward empirical observation and how this perspective changed with subsequent discoveries.

In the early days, cell biology was misunderstood as being predominantly observational. It was seen merely as the study of cell structures through a microscope, with cells appearing basic and unchallenging to established scientific principles. This perspective changed beginning in the 1940s when pioneers in cell biology started unraveling the biochemical mechanisms within cells, revealing a complex miniaturized machinery.

The change from empirical observation to a more complex study with theoretical backing came with the discovery of the following:

1. Cells as basic units of life - Structures performing essential functions like energy extraction, material synthesis, and self-regulation.
2. Biochemical mechanisms - Complex processes within cells, especially noted from 1940-70, which shifted the view of cell biology from being simply observational to being a rich field requiring deeper scientific understanding.

## 2. Describe the essential vital functions of cells according to Theodor Schwann's conclusions.

Theodor Schwann, in the 1830s, concluded that cells are the fundamental units of life and perform essential vital functions. These functions include:

1. Extracting energy and building materials from the environment.
2. Constructing and repairing themselves.
3. Synthesizing products for export.
4. Regulating internal operations.
5. Reproducing periodically by dividing.
6. Cleaning up their own waste.

## 3. How did the discoveries in cell biology from the 1940s to 1970s revolutionize our understanding of life processes?

Discoveries in cell biology from the 1940s to 1970s revolutionized our understanding of life processes by bringing to light the complex biochemical mechanisms within cells. These years marked the transition from mere structural observation to detailed biochemical and molecular analysis revealing intricate cellular machinery.

## 4. Relate the complexity found in cell biology to the philosophy of science.

The complexity found in cell biology challenges the previous philosophical stance that considered scientific inquiry should be straightforward and empirical. The intricate biochemical mechanisms revealed since the 1940s necessitate a much more nuanced and theoretical approach, impacting how the philosophy of science perceives and addresses biological phenomena.

%
- Shift in philosophy: From empirical to theoretical and complex analysis.
- Complexity of life: Requires advanced concepts and methodologies.
- Philosophical impact: Changed the way scientific principles are understood in biological contexts.
