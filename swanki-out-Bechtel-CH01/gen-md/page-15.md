Molecular biologists in the 1940s and 1950s developed several key tools that uncovered DNA as the hereditary material. Those tools include:
  
- **Stains and dyes**: Developed in the late nineteenth century, stains made it possible for cytologists to observe structures within what was previously considered formless cytoplasm.
- **Electron microscope and ultracentrifuge**: Instruments developed by physicists and chemists in the 1920s and 1930s that allowed biologists to study cellular mechanisms more closely by generating higher resolution images and separating cell contents.

## How do the cytoplasm's mechanisms contribute to the cell's function and what role does energy play in these processes?

%

The cytoplasm is responsible for several crucial cellular mechanisms including:
- **Intake of materials from the cell's environment**: Cytoplasmic mechanisms help in absorbing external substances necessary for the cell's functions.
- **Breakdown of materials**: It digests both external materials and worn-out pieces of its own structure.
- **Synthesis of new components**: Cytoplasm mechanisms also synthesize new cellular components and materials for export.
  
All these processes are energy-intensive, requiring additional mechanisms to procure and make energy readily available.

## What were major challenges biologists faced when developing techniques to use the electron microscope and ultracentrifuge for cellular studies?

%

Biologists faced the following major challenges:
- **Engineering Challenges**: They had to find ways to achieve new tasks such as releasing cell contents without disrupting internal structures and developing stains that differentially diffract electrons.
- **Epistemic Challenges**: Ensuring that the observations accurately represented the phenomenon of interest and were not just artifacts of the preparation methods or instrument used.

## What roles do the electron microscope and ultracentrifuge play in cellular research and which domain's contributions were crucial for their development?

%

The electron microscope and ultracentrifuge are essential in cellular research due to their ability to:
- **Electron Microscope**: Provides high-resolution images of cellular structures, allowing detailed study of both the surface and internal cell structures.
- **Ultracentrifuge**: Separates cell components with great precision, which is crucial for studying individual organelles and their biochemical activities.

These tools were developed with significant contributions from the domains of **physics** and **chemistry**.
