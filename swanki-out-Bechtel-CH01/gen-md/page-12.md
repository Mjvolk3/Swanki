## Describe the focus and mission of institutions like the American Society for Cell Biology.

The focus and mission of institutions like the American Society for Cell Biology and the Journal of Cell Biology have been centered on investigating the various organelles of the cell and their functioning. These organizations and the investigators affiliated with them share the common mission of understanding the structure and function of the mechanisms that comprise cells. Additionally, they utilize common research instruments and techniques, particularly electron microscopy and cell fractionation.

## Summarize the role of electron microscopy and cell fractionation in cell biology research.

Electron microscopy and cell fractionation are eminent techniques used in cell biology research. Electron microscopy allows for the detailed visualization of cell structures at a molecular level, while cell fractionation enables the separation and analysis of different cellular components. Collectively, these methods have been pivotal in advancing our understanding of the structure and function of various organelles within a cell.

## Explain the concept of "interfield theories" as described by Darden and Maull (1977).

Darden and Maull's (1977) concept of "interfield theories" refers to theories that explain the relations between different scientific fields. They described several types of interfield relations, including:

(a) **Structure-function**: For example, physical chemistry targets the structure of molecules, while biochemistry describes their function.

(b) **Physical location of a postulated entity or process**: For instance, the identification of chromosomes in cells by cytologists provides the physical location of genes postulated by geneticists.

(c) **Physical nature**: This involves the essence or characteristics of a scientific entity or process discovered by one field and relevant to another.

## Describe how new disciplines or research areas can emerge, using the examples of molecular biology and computer science.

New disciplines or research areas can emerge due to various reasons, including:

(a) **Adaptation within a discipline**: An investigative strategy and a mission that diverge within an existing discipline but are not comfortably accommodated by it. For example, molecular biology arose in part from biochemistry but eventually separated, creating an uneasy relationship for many years.

(b) **Creation of a new domain**: The advent of a new domain, along with dedicated individuals, methods, and a mission, can result in the emergence of a new discipline. For example, the rise of computer science in the mid-twentieth century occurred as a response to new technological and methodological demands.

(c) **Emergence in an unoccupied domain**: New disciplines can also emerge in unoccupied domains lying between existing fields where no current discipline possesses the necessary research tools to study that domain effectively.
