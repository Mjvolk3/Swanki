## According to Shapere and Toulmin, why is it insufficient to identify the set of objects comprising the domain of a discipline solely based on the objects of study?

To identify the set of objects comprising the domain of a discipline, we also need to consider why scientists group them together and the questions raised about them.

## What examples does Toulmin provide to illustrate that the same type of object can fall within the domains of different sciences? Provide explanation with different perspectives.

## How did logical empiricists approach the question of the unity of science in the twentieth century, particularly in relation to biology, physics, and chemistry?

Logical empiricists approached the unity of science by asking whether the theories (laws) of biology could be derived from those of chemistry and physics with the aid of bridge principles and boundary conditions, thus potentially reducing biology to these sciences.
