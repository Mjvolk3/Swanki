## What is Kuhn's notion of a paradigm in a more restricted sense?

Kuhn's notion of a paradigm in a more restricted sense refers to an exemplar - a solution to a particular problem that became a model for solving other problems. The paradigm serves as a guide for scientists in similar situations, providing strategies for solving subsequent problems.

## What does Kuhn's extended notion of a paradigm include, and what criticisms has it faced?

Kuhn's extended notion of a paradigm includes a general theory or theory schema that characterizes a domain, identifies problems to be solved, and specifies strategies for solving them and criteria for evaluating proposed solutions.

The extended notion of a paradigm became the focus of severe criticism for being sufficiently vague. This vagueness hindered its utility in philosophical accounts of science and led to its decline in influence.

## What elements did Darden and Maull propose define a scientific field?

Darden and Maull proposed a multifaceted conception of a scientific field that includes the following elements:

1. A central problem.
2. A domain of items taken to be facts related to the central problem.
3. General explanatory facts and goals.
4. Techniques and methods.
5. Sometimes, but not always, concepts, laws, and theories related to the central problem and explanatory goals.

## According to the paper, what is especially relevant for understanding scientific fields in biology and what comprises the field's mission?

In many areas of biology, explanation takes the form of an account of the mechanism responsible for a phenomenon. The central problem is the discovery and refinement of this mechanism. This cluster, termed the field's mission, includes:

1. Explanatory goals.
2. Types of accounts offered (e.g., laws or theories).
3. Conceptualization of the central problem.
