Instead of unifying generalizations, cell biology focuses on

1. Detailed accounts of complex mechanisms.
2. Specific operations performed by different component parts.
3. Organization and orchestration of these parts for a cell's essential functions.

## What kind of scientific focal points are developed in cell biology according to the passage?

Cell biology focuses on

1. Meticulous accounts of complex mechanisms.
2. Detailed processes and component interrelations.
3. Essential functions specific to cell types.

These foci differ from the broad generalizations typically seen in physics.

## In the context of science, how does the paper propose to complement the Newtonian vision of science?

The paper proposes complementing the Newtonian vision with a perspective that emphasizes:

1. The search for mechanisms.
2. Detailed mechanistic accounts appropriate for domains like cell biology, molecular biology, and neurobiology.
3. Descriptions and evaluations tailored to functional domains of biology and related sciences.

## What did Frances Crick succinctly suggest about the nature of scientific inquiry in cell biology?

Frances Crick emphasized that much of science, particularly in biology, is a quest to articulate mechanisms rather than seeking bold, unifying generalizations.
