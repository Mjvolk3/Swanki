## Explain how Albert Claude's shift in focus helped to further cell biology research.

Albert Claude initially focused on cancer cells but later studied particles isolated from normal cells when his discovery was not unique to cancer cells. He identified chemical reactions associated with centrifuged fractions and collaborated with Keith Porter to compare particles in fractions with components of intact cells using electron microscopy. A major accomplishment was demonstrating that mitochondria, the power plants of the cell, contained critical enzymes for cellular respiration, which played a crucial role in furthering cell biology research.

## In the 1950s and 1960s, what two major techniques were adopted by researchers to understand cell cytoplasm mechanisms?

The two major techniques adopted by researchers were 
1. Electron microscopy 
2. Cell fractionation

These methods led to detailed studies of cell organelles, such as mitochondria, and their roles in biochemical operations.

## Describe the significance of the discovery related to certain key enzymes in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.

Certain key enzymes were discovered to be embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. This spatial and temporal organization is crucial for the reactions involved in electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. This discovery provided a model for linking functions with organelles, aiding researchers in understanding cellular mechanisms.

## According to the document, what are three indirect measures used by cell biologists to answer epistemic challenges, and why are they important?

The three indirect measures used by cell biologists are:
1. Determinateness and repeatability of resulting evidence
2. Consilience of evidence from multiple techniques
3. Coherence of the evidence with plausible accounts of the mechanism under study

These measures are important because they help ensure the reliability and validity of the scientific findings despite the complexity and indirect nature of the investigative techniques.
