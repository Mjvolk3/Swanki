## What important institutions were created to support the emerging discipline of cell biology in the 1950s and 60s?

In the 1950s, research in the emerging field of cell biology required new institutional structures. Consequently:

1. The *Journal of Biophysical and Biological Cytology* was established in 1956. It became the premier journal for the new community and was renamed the *Journal of Cell Biology* in 1962.
2. The *American Society for Cell Biology* was founded in 1960 to provide a platform for regular scientific meetings.

## Why was there a need to create the Journal of Biophysical and Biological Cytology in 1956?

The need for the creation of the Journal of Biophysical and Biological Cytology in 1956 arose because cell biology was becoming highly specialized and fell outside the scope of existing disciplines. This led many scientists to feel the necessity for dedicated journals to disseminate their specialized research.
