## Explain the concept of "invisible college" as coined by Derek de Solla Price.

The concept of "invisible college," coined by Derek de Solla Price, refers to groups of researchers who:
1. Are in regular communication.
2. Share a common conceptual framework, problem focus, and set of techniques.
3. May differ on empirical claims or proposed theories but are still part of a cohesive network.

## How are collaboration networks characterized and what is meant by a "small world" structure in these networks?

Collaboration networks are characterized by coauthorship of papers:
1. Two scientists are directly linked if they have coauthored a paper.
2. Indirect links exist if two scientists have not coauthored a paper but have coauthored separate papers with another scientist.
3. These networks form "small world" structures, meaning randomly chosen pairs of scientists are typically separated by a short path of intermediate collaborators.
