## Describe the primary role of the endoplasmic reticulum in cells.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is primarily involved in the synthesis of proteins (rough ER) and lipids (smooth ER). It plays a crucial role in the transportation of synthesized proteins and lipids to different parts of the cell.

## Explain the importance and function of Golgi apparatus in cells.

The Golgi apparatus is essential for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids that have been synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. It also forms lysosomes and transports molecules to their correct destinations in the cell.
