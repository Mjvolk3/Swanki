for investigations of other cell organelles and their functions, including the role of the ribosomes and endoplasmic reticulum in protein synthesis, the Golgi apparatus in cell secretion, and the lysosome in recycling cell waste.

As I discussed in the previous section, an important aspect of scientific disciplines is the creation of institutional structures. In the 1950s, research in the new discipline of cell biology was becoming highly specialized. It also fell sufficiently outside the scope of existing disciplines that numerous scientists felt the need to create new journals. The Journal of Biophysical and Biological Cytology was established in 1956 and rapidly established itself as the premier journal for the new community. In 1962 it changed its name to the Journal of Cell Biology, thereby recognizing the name increasingly favored for this discipline. The growing community also felt the need for regular scientific meetings; in 1960 they founded the American Society for Cell Biology. Creating a journal and a society were not small undertakings but required scientists to take substantial amounts of time away from research. The character of the journal and the society, moreover, were not foreordained, but resulted from explicit deliberation by these pioneers in cell biology. Chapter 7 will examine the processes involved in creating and nurturing the new journal and new society.
