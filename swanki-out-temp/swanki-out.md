## When solving for the stationary points of a function $f(x_1, x_2)$ subject to a constraint $g(x_1, x_2) = 0$, why might solving the constraint equation directly to express $x_2$ as a function of $x_1$ be challenging?

Solving the constraint equation directly may be challenging because it might not be possible to find an analytic solution that allows $x_2$ to be expressed explicitly as a function of $x_1$. Additionally, this method treats $x_1$ and $x_2$ differently, destroying the natural symmetry between these variables.

## Describe how a Lagrange multiplier, $\lambda$, is used in the method of Lagrange multipliers to address the problem of finding the stationary points of a function $f(x_1, x_2)$ subject to a constraint $g(x_1, x_2)=0$.

A Lagrange multiplier, $\lambda$, is introduced to transform the original problem into finding the stationary points of the Lagrangian function:

$$
\mathcal{L}(x_1, x_2, \lambda) = f(x_1, x_2) - \lambda g(x_1, x_2)
$$

The stationary points are then found by setting the gradients with respect to $x_1$, $x_2$, and $\lambda$ to zero.

## Explain how the gradient of the constraint function $g(\mathbf{x})$ is related to the constraint surface in $\mathbf{x}$-space.

At any point on the constraint surface, the gradient $\nabla g(\mathbf{x})$ of the constraint function is orthogonal to the surface. This can be demonstrated by considering a small perturbation $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ and using a Taylor expansion around a point $\mathbf{x}$ on the constraint surface:

$$
g(\mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}) \sims g(\mathbf{x}) + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{T}} \nabla g(\mathbf{x})
$$

Given $g(\mathbf{x}) = g(\mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon})$, it follows that $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{T}} \nabla g(\mathbf{x}) \sims 0$.

## In Lagrange multipliers, why is the gradient $\nabla g(\mathbf{x})$ orthogonal to the surface of the constraint function $g(\mathbf{x})=0$?

At any point $\mathbf{x}$ on the constraint surface, a nearby point $\mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ also lies on the surface. Using a Taylor expansion:

$$
g(\mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}) \sims g(\mathbf{x}) + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{T}} \nabla g(\mathbf{x})
$$

Given both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ satisfy the constraint $g(\mathbf{x}) = g(\mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon})$, $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{T}} \nabla g(\mathbf{x}) \sims 0$ in the limit $\|\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\| \rightarrow 0$.

## How can the technique of Lagrange multipliers be motivated from a geometrical perspective in $\mathbf{x}$-space?

From a geometrical perspective, the constraint $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ represents a $(D-1)$-dimensional surface in $D$-dimensional $\mathbf{x}$-space. The gradient $\nabla g(\mathbf{x})$ is orthogonal to this constraint surface. This orthogonality ensures that any perturbation $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ within the surface satisfies $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{T}} \nabla g(\mathbf{x}) \sims 0$.

## Explain the step-by-step process of finding a stationary point using Lagrange multipliers for a function $f(x_1, x_2)$ subject to $g(x_1, x_2) = 0$.

1. Construct the Lagrangian function:
   $$
   \mathcal{L}(x_1, x_2, \lambda) = f(x_1, x_2) - \lambda g(x_1, x_2)
   $$

2. Find the partial derivatives:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x_1} &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} - \lambda \frac{\partial g}{\partial x_1} \\
   \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x_2} &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} - \lambda \frac{\partial g}{\partial x_2} \\
   \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} &= -g(x_1, x_2)
   \end{aligned}
   $$

3. Set each partial derivative to zero and solve the resulting system of equations to find $x_1, x_2$, and $\lambda$.

## Explain the role of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ in the context of the Lagrangian function $L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda)$.

The Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ is used to enforce the constraint $g(\mathbf{x})=0$. When optimizing the Lagrangian function 

$$ 
L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda) = f(\mathbf{x}) + \lambda g(\mathbf{x})
$$ 

the condition $\partial L / \partial \lambda = 0$ leads to the constraint equation $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$. Therefore, $\lambda$ serves as a parameter ensuring that the optimization adheres to the constraint.

## What are the necessary conditions for finding the stationary points of the Lagrangian function $L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda)$?

To find the stationary points of the Lagrangian function 

$$ 
L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda) = f(\mathbf{x}) + \lambda g(\mathbf{x}), 
$$

the following conditions must be satisfied:

1. $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} L = 0$
2. $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = 0$

These conditions lead to a system of equations to solve for the stationary points $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ and the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$.

## Describe the geometric interpretation of $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$ being parallel (or anti-parallel) in the context of Lagrange multipliers.

The geometric interpretation is that at the point $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ where $f(\mathbf{x})$ is maximized subject to the constraint $g(\mathbf{x})=0$, the gradient of $f$, $\nabla f(\mathbf{x})$, is perpendicular to the constraint surface. Since the gradient of the constraint function, $\nabla g(\mathbf{x})$, is also perpendicular to the constraint surface, $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$ must be parallel (or anti-parallel). Thus, 

$$
\nabla f + \lambda \nabla g = 0,
$$

where $\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier.

## How many equations are there to solve when finding the stationary point $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ of the Lagrangian function with a $D$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{x}$?

For a $D$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{x}$, finding the stationary point of the Lagrangian function $L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda)$ involves solving $D + 1$ equations. This is because we need to satisfy:

1. $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} L = 0$ (which gives $D$ equations)
2. $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = 0$ (which gives 1 equation)

These $D + 1$ equations determine both the stationary point $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ and the value of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$.

## Given the function $f(x_1, x_2) = 1 - x_1^2 - x_2^2$ and the constraint $g(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2 - 1 = 0$, find the stationary points using the Lagrangian function.

To find the stationary points, we start with the Lagrangian function

$$
L(x_1, x_2, \lambda) = 1 - x_1^2 - x_2^2 + \lambda (x_1 + x_2 - 1).
$$

The conditions for this Lagrangian to be stationary are given by:

\[
\begin{aligned}
-2x_1 + \lambda & = 0, \\
-2x_2 + \lambda & = 0, \\
x_1 + x_2 - 1 & = 0.
\end{aligned}
\]

Solving these equations, we get $x_1 = x_2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $\lambda = -1$.

## Why is the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ referred to as an 'undetermined multiplier'?

The term 'undetermined multiplier' is used because $\lambda$ is introduced to enforce the constraint $g(\mathbf{x})=0$ without needing to explicitly determine its value. The main focus is on finding the stationary point $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ of the function $f(\mathbf{x})$, and $\lambda$ is calculated implicitly during this optimization process. Essentially, $ \lambda$ helps satisfy the constraint, but its exact value is not our primary concern.

The technique of Lagrange multipliers is used to maximize a function $f(\mathbf{x})$ subject to a constraint $g(\mathbf{x})=0$. Geometrically, this constraint corresponds to a subspace of dimensionality $D-1$, illustrated by the red curve. The method involves optimizing the Lagrangian function $L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda)=f(\mathbf{x})+\lambda g(\mathbf{x})$. At the point $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ on the constraint surface, the gradients $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$ are parallel or anti-parallel, leading to the condition:

$$
\nabla f + \lambda \nabla g = 0
$$

where $\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier.

## What condition must be met for the optimization of a function using Lagrange multipliers?

%

For the optimization of a function using Lagrange multipliers, the gradient of the function $f(\mathbf{x})$, denoted as $\nabla f$, and the gradient of the constraint $g(\mathbf{x})$, denoted as $\nabla g$, must be parallel or anti-parallel vectors. This can be formulated as:

$$
\nabla f + \lambda \nabla g = 0
$$

### Card 1

How does the method of Lagrange multipliers ensure that the constraint surface $g(\mathbf{x})=0$ is respected while maximizing the function $f(\mathbf{x})$?

%

The method involves constructing the Lagrangian function $L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda) = f(\mathbf{x}) + \lambda g(\mathbf{x})$, where $\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier. By requiring that the gradients of $f$ and $g$ are parallel (or anti-parallel) at the point $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ on the constraint surface, we guarantee that the function $f(\mathbf{x})$ is optimized while still satisfying $g(\mathbf{x})=0$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$
\nabla f + \lambda \nabla g = 0
$$

What geometric relationship between $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$ is critical for the method of Lagrange multipliers?

%

The critical geometric relationship is that $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$ must be parallel (or anti-parallel) at the optimization point $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$. This ensures that any movement along the constraint surface $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ does not increase the value of $f(\mathbf{x})$. Mathematically, this is represented by:

$$
\nabla f + \lambda \nabla g = 0

## Describe the case when the constraint $g(\mathbf{x}) \geq 0$ is active or inactive in inequality-constrained optimization.

2. **Inactive Constraint**: The constrained stationary point lies in the region $g(\mathbf{x}) > 0$, and $\lambda = 0$.

In the inactive case, the constraint plays no role, hence:

$$

### Card 5

## How does the sign of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ influence the solution for inequality constraints in Lagrangian optimization?

The solution to the inequality constraint problem is valid only if $\lambda > 0$, ensuring that the gradient is oriented away from the region where $g(\mathbf{x}) > 0$:

$$
\nabla f(\mathbf{x}) = -\lambda \nabla g(\mathbf{x}) \text{ for some } \lambda > 0

%

The stationary point is determined by solving the equations derived from the Lagrangian function. Given the objective function $f\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)=1 - x_{1}^{2} - x_{2}^{2}$ and the constraint $g\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)=x_{1}+x_{2}-1 = 0$, the Lagrangian is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{L}(x_{1}, x_{2}, \lambda) = f(x_{1}, x_{2}) - \lambda g(x_{1}, x_{2}).
$$

Substituting $f$ and $g$,

$$
\mathcal{L}(x_{1}, x_{2}, \lambda) = (1 - x_{1}^{2} - x_{2}^{2}) - \lambda (x_{1} + x_{2} - 1).
$$

Taking partial derivatives with respect to $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, and $\lambda$, and setting them to zero, we find:

\[
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x_{1}} &= -2x_{1} - \lambda = 0, \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x_{2}} &= -2x_{2} - \lambda = 0, \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} &= -(x_{1} + x_{2} - 1) = 0. \\
\end{aligned}
\right.
\]

Solving these equations simultaneously, we obtain the stationary point $\left(x_{1}^{\star}, x_{2}^{\star}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ and the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda = 1$.

Explain how the Lagrange multipliers method is applied to maximize the function \( f(x_1, x_2) = 1 - x_1^2 - x_2^2 \) subject to the constraint \( g(x_1, x_2) = 0 \), with \( g(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2 - 1 \).
%
The Lagrange multipliers method involves introducing a new variable, $\lambda$, called the Lagrange multiplier, and forming the Lagrangian:

$$
\mathcal{L}(x_1, x_2, \lambda) = f(x_1, x_2) + \lambda g(x_1, x_2)
$$

For this problem:

$$
\mathcal{L}(x_1, x_2, \lambda) = (1 - x_1^2 - x_2^2) + \lambda (x_1 + x_2 - 1)
$$

We then set the partial derivatives of $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $x_1$, $x_2$, and $\lambda$ equal to zero:

\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x_1} = -2x_1 + \lambda = 0 \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x_2} = -2x_2 + \lambda = 0 \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = x_1 + x_2 - 1 = 0
\end{cases}
\]

Solving these equations, we find the stationary point $\left(x_1^{\star}, x_2^{\star}\right)=(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$, and the corresponding value for the Lagrange multiplier is $\lambda = 1$.

Describe the geometric interpretation of the stationary point \(\left(x_{1}^{\star}, x_{2}^{\star}\right)=\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)\) in the context of Lagrange multipliers.
%
At the stationary point \(\left(x_{1}^{\star}, x_{2}^{\star}\right)=\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)\), the gradient of the function $f$ is perpendicular (orthogonal) to the constraint surface $g(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2 - 1 = 0$. This means:

1. **Contours of \( f \)**: The concentric circles in the graph represent the contours of \( f(x_1, x_2) = 1 - x_1^2 - x_2^2 \). Each contour line corresponds to a constant value of \( f \).

2. **Constraint Surface**: The straight red line represents the constraint \( g(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2 - 1 = 0 \).

3. **Stationary Point**: The point \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)\) is marked on the graph where the function \( f \) achieves its maximum value subject to the constraint \( g(x_1, x_2) = 0 \). At this point, the gradient of \( f \) is parallel to the gradient of \( g \), indicating orthogonality to the constraint surface.

There are two points, \( X_A \) and \( X_B \), with \( X_A \) on the constraint boundary and \( X_B \) within the permissible region. At \( X_A \), the gradients \( \nabla f(x) \) and \( \nabla g(x) \) are depicted, showing the feasible direction for maximization.

%

At point \( X_A \), the vectors indicate:
- \( \nabla f(x) \): The gradient of the objective function $f(\mathbf{x})$, pointing in the direction of the steepest ascent for maximization.

### Question 1

How does the method of Lagrange multipliers relate to the function and constraint depicted in the diagram? Explain the significance of points \( X_A \) and \( X_B \).

%

The method of Lagrange multipliers is used for optimizing a function $f(\mathbf{x})$ subject to constraints like $g(\mathbf{x}) \geq 0$. In the diagram:

- **Point \( X_A \)**: It lies on the constraint boundary where \( g(x) = 0 \). The vectors indicate that the gradient $\nabla f(x)$ points away from the feasible region, and the gradient $\nabla g(x)$ is perpendicular to the boundary, signifying directions for function maximization.
  
- **Point \( X_B \)**: It is within the region satisfying $g(x) > 0$, meaning the constraint is not active at this point. Thus, $g(x) \geq 0$ is strictly satisfied, and the function does not need to account for the constraint here.

- #mathematics.optimization, #calculus.lagrange-multipliers, #functions.inequality-constraints

### Question 2

What are the conditions when using Lagrange multipliers to maximize \( f(\mathbf{x}) \) subject to the constraint \( g(\mathbf{x}) \geq 0 \), and how is it represented in the given diagram?

% 

In the case of maximizing \( f(\mathbf{x}) \) under the constraint \( g(\mathbf{x}) \geq 0 \), the condition is that the product \( \lambda g(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \). This implies either \( \lambda = 0 \) or \( g(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \):

- **At Point \( X_A \)**: The constraint \( g(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \). Here, the gradients $\nabla f(x)$ and $\nabla g(x)$ align with optimization principles, where $\nabla f(x)$ interacts with the boundary (equality constraint).
  
- **At Point \( X_B \)**: The constraint is inactive \( g(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \), indicating $\lambda = 0$ since the point lies within the permissible region.

This setup ensures that we either remain on the boundary (active constraint) or inside the feasible region without the constraint being active.
