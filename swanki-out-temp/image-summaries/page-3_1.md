ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a graphical representation of the use of Lagrange multipliers for optimization under constraints. It shows a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, with \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) as the axes. The image includes several elements:

- A set of concentric circles, colored in blue, representing the contours of the function \( f(x_1, x_2) = 1 - x_{1}^{2} - x_{2}^{2} \). The circles indicate points where the function takes the same value, with values increasing towards the center.
- A straight red line with the equation \( g(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2 - 1 = 0 \), which represents the constraint surface.
- A point marked with a dot and labeled \( (x_{1}^{\star}, x_{2}^{\star}) \), representing the stationary point of the function \( f \) subject to the constraint \( g \) where the optimization process finds a maximum.
  
The graph visually demonstrates the concept described in the text, where at the point \( (x_{1}^{\star}, x_{2}^{\star}) \), the gradient of the function \( f \) is orthogonal (perpendicular) to the constraint surface \( g(x_1, x_2) = 0 \), which is a necessary condition for a maximum to exist under the given constraint.
