ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts a red, closed, two-dimensional shape representing a constraint surface with an equation g(X) = 0. There is a point X_A on this surface. From point X_A, two vectors are shown: one labeled as the gradient of f (denoted by ∇f(X)) and the other as the gradient of g (denoted by ∇g(X)). The vectors are drawn such that they are orthogonal to the constraint surface at point X_A, illustrating that both the gradients of the objective function f and the constraint function g are perpendicular to the surface at the point of interest. This demonstrates geometrically how, at the maximum of the function f subject to the constraint g, the gradients of the two functions are parallel or anti-parallel, which is a central concept in the method of Lagrange multipliers.
