### Question 1

How does the method of Lagrange multipliers relate to the function and constraint depicted in the diagram? Explain the significance of points \( X_A \) and \( X_B \).

The method of Lagrange multipliers is used for optimizing a function $f(\mathbf{x})$ subject to constraints like $g(\mathbf{x}) \geq 0$. In the diagram:

- **Point \( X_A \)**: It lies on the constraint boundary where \( g(x) = 0 \). The vectors indicate that the gradient $\nabla f(x)$ points away from the feasible region, and the gradient $\nabla g(x)$ is perpendicular to the boundary, signifying directions for function maximization.
  
- **Point \( X_B \)**: It is within the region satisfying $g(x) > 0$, meaning the constraint is not active at this point. Thus, $g(x) \geq 0$ is strictly satisfied, and the function does not need to account for the constraint here.

### Question 2

What are the conditions when using Lagrange multipliers to maximize \( f(\mathbf{x}) \) subject to the constraint \( g(\mathbf{x}) \geq 0 \), and how is it represented in the given diagram?

% 

In the case of maximizing \( f(\mathbf{x}) \) under the constraint \( g(\mathbf{x}) \geq 0 \), the condition is that the product \( \lambda g(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \). This implies either \( \lambda = 0 \) or \( g(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \):

- **At Point \( X_A \)**: The constraint \( g(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \). Here, the gradients $\nabla f(x)$ and $\nabla g(x)$ align with optimization principles, where $\nabla f(x)$ interacts with the boundary (equality constraint).
  
- **At Point \( X_B \)**: The constraint is inactive \( g(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \), indicating $\lambda = 0$ since the point lies within the permissible region.

This setup ensures that we either remain on the boundary (active constraint) or inside the feasible region without the constraint being active.
