The image illustrates the optimization of a function $f(\mathbf{x})$ subject to the inequality constraint $g(\mathbf{x}) \geqslant 0$. It shows a 2D region where $g(x) > 0$ with the boundary defined by $g(x) = 0$. There are two points, \( X_A \) and \( X_B \), with \( X_A \) on the constraint boundary and \( X_B \) within the permissible region. At \( X_A \), the gradients \( \nabla f(x) \) and \( \nabla g(x) \) are depicted, showing the feasible direction for maximization.

## What do the vectors at point \( X_A \) indicate in the context of the optimization problem?

At point \( X_A \), the vectors indicate:
- \( \nabla f(x) \): The gradient of the objective function $f(\mathbf{x})$, pointing in the direction of the steepest ascent for maximization.
- \( \nabla g(x) \): The gradient of the constraint function $g(\mathbf{x})$, perpendicular to the constraint surface $g(x) = 0$. In the context of Lagrange multipliers, these gradients help identify feasible directions for optimization under the given constraints.
