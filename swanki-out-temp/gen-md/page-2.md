## Explain the role of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ in the context of the Lagrangian function $L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda)$.

The Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ is used to enforce the constraint $g(\mathbf{x})=0$. When optimizing the Lagrangian function 

$$ 
L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda) = f(\mathbf{x}) + \lambda g(\mathbf{x})
$$ 

the condition $\partial L / \partial \lambda = 0$ leads to the constraint equation $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$. Therefore, $\lambda$ serves as a parameter ensuring that the optimization adheres to the constraint.

## What are the necessary conditions for finding the stationary points of the Lagrangian function $L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda)$?

To find the stationary points of the Lagrangian function 

$$ 
L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda) = f(\mathbf{x}) + \lambda g(\mathbf{x}), 
$$

the following conditions must be satisfied:

1. $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} L = 0$
2. $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = 0$

These conditions lead to a system of equations to solve for the stationary points $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ and the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$.

## Describe the geometric interpretation of $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$ being parallel (or anti-parallel) in the context of Lagrange multipliers.

The geometric interpretation is that at the point $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ where $f(\mathbf{x})$ is maximized subject to the constraint $g(\mathbf{x})=0$, the gradient of $f$, $\nabla f(\mathbf{x})$, is perpendicular to the constraint surface. Since the gradient of the constraint function, $\nabla g(\mathbf{x})$, is also perpendicular to the constraint surface, $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$ must be parallel (or anti-parallel). Thus, 

$$
\nabla f + \lambda \nabla g = 0,
$$

where $\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier.

## How many equations are there to solve when finding the stationary point $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ of the Lagrangian function with a $D$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{x}$?

For a $D$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{x}$, finding the stationary point of the Lagrangian function $L(\mathbf{x}, \lambda)$ involves solving $D + 1$ equations. This is because we need to satisfy:

1. $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} L = 0$ (which gives $D$ equations)
2. $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = 0$ (which gives 1 equation)

These $D + 1$ equations determine both the stationary point $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ and the value of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$.

## Given the function $f(x_1, x_2) = 1 - x_1^2 - x_2^2$ and the constraint $g(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2 - 1 = 0$, find the stationary points using the Lagrangian function.

To find the stationary points, we start with the Lagrangian function

$$
L(x_1, x_2, \lambda) = 1 - x_1^2 - x_2^2 + \lambda (x_1 + x_2 - 1).
$$

The conditions for this Lagrangian to be stationary are given by:

\[
\begin{aligned}
-2x_1 + \lambda & = 0, \\
-2x_2 + \lambda & = 0, \\
x_1 + x_2 - 1 & = 0.
\end{aligned}
\]

Solving these equations, we get $x_1 = x_2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $\lambda = -1$.

## Why is the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ referred to as an 'undetermined multiplier'?

The term 'undetermined multiplier' is used because $\lambda$ is introduced to enforce the constraint $g(\mathbf{x})=0$ without needing to explicitly determine its value. The main focus is on finding the stationary point $\mathbf{x}^{\star}$ of the function $f(\mathbf{x})$, and $\lambda$ is calculated implicitly during this optimization process. Essentially, $ \lambda$ helps satisfy the constraint, but its exact value is not our primary concern.
