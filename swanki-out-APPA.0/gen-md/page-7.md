## Explain the determinants and traces relationship for a symmetric matrix using eigenvalues.

For a symmetric matrix $\mathbf{A}$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_i$, the determinant and trace of $\mathbf{A}$ are given by:

$$
|\mathbf{A}| = \prod_{i=1}^{M} \lambda_{i}
$$

and

$$
\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A})=\sum_{i=1}^{M} \lambda_{i}
$$

Explain the significance of these expressions and how they relate to the properties of $\mathbf{A}$.

%

The determinant $|\mathbf{A}|$ reflects the scaled volume transformation described by $\mathbf{A}$ and is zero if any $\lambda_i$ is zero, indicating singularity. The trace $\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A})$, on the other hand, is the sum of eigenvalues, giving a measure of the cumulative stretch applied by $\mathbf{A}$ over its axes.

## Define and explain the condition number of a matrix.

The condition number of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$, particularly in the context of its eigenvalues, is defined by:

$$
\mathrm{CN}=\left(\frac{\lambda_{\max }}{\lambda_{\min }}\right)^{1 / 2}
$$

where $\lambda_{\max}$ and $\lambda_{\min}$ are the largest and smallest eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$, respectively.

%

The condition number measures how much the output value of the function can change for a small change in the input, indicating the sensitivity of the matrix. A high condition number implies that the matrix is close to singular and may lead to numerical instability in calculations.

## Describe the criteria for a matrix to be positive definite or positive semidefinite.

Given a matrix $\mathbf{A}$, define the criteria for it to be classified as positive definite or positive semidefinite.

%

A matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is positive definite, denoted $\mathbf{A} \succ 0$, if $\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{A w}>0$ for all non-zero vectors $\mathbf{w}$. Equivalently, all its eigenvalues $\lambda_i > 0$.

A matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is positive semidefinite, denoted $\mathbf{A} \succeq 0$, if $\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{A w} \geq 0$ for all vectors $\mathbf{w}$, which is equivalent to $\lambda_i \geq 0$ for all eigenvalues.

## What happens to the matrix and its eigenvalues when it is not positive definite?

Analyze the eigenvalues of the matrix

$$
\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{array}\right)
$$

and determine whether it is positive definite or not.

%

The given matrix has eigenvalues $\lambda_{1} \simeq 5.37$ and $\lambda_{2} \simeq -0.37$. Since one of the eigenvalues is negative, the matrix is not positive definite. A matrix is not positive definite if any eigenvalue $\lambda_i \leq 0$.

## Verify the relationship among equations (A.22), (A.33), (A.45), (A.46), and (A.47).

Verify the expression (A.22) using the results from equations (A.33), (A.45), (A.46), and (A.47).

%

This is an exercise left for the reader to understand how the results from equations (A.33), (A.45), (A.46), and (A.47) help verify expression (A.22). The relationships among different expressions play a crucial role in simplifying and understanding complex matrix operations and properties.

## Explain the sum and product of eigenvalues of a matrix and their significance.

For a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_i$, what do the following expressions represent?

$$
|\mathbf{A}|=\prod_{i=1}^{M} \lambda_{i}
$$

$$
\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A})=\sum_{i=1}^{M} \lambda_{i}
$$

%

The expression $|\mathbf{A}|=\prod_{i=1}^{M} \lambda_{i}$ represents the determinant of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$, which is the product of its eigenvalues. This gives us an idea of the overall scaling effect of $\mathbf{A}$.

The expression $\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A}) = \sum_{i=1}^{M} \lambda_{i}$ represents the trace of the matrix, which is the sum of its eigenvalues. This provides insights into the aggregate influence of $\mathbf{A}$ along its principal directions.
