## Considering the properties of transposes and inverses, explain and verify the relationship $(\mathbf{A B})^{\mathrm{T}}=\mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}}$

Given matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, the transpose of their product can be found as:

$$
(\mathbf{A B})^{\mathrm{T}} = \mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

To verify this, consider the definitions of the matrices and their corresponding elements.

## Demonstrate how the inverse of a product of matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ can be represented in terms of the inverses of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$.

The inverse of the product of two matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is given by:

$$
(\mathbf{A B})^{-1} = \mathbf{B}^{-1} \mathbf{A}^{-1}
$$

This can be shown by multiplying both sides and confirming the identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$ is obtained.

## Define and mathematically verify the identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$ as it relates to matrix inverses.

For any invertible matrix $\mathbf{A}$, the identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$ satisfies:

$$
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}
$$

This is the foundational property of matrix inverses, ensuring that multiplying a matrix by its inverse gives the identity matrix.

## Explain the result $\left(\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}}\right)^{-1}=\left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}$ for invertible matrices and demonstrate its verification.

If $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, then the transpose of its inverse is equal to the inverse of its transpose:

$$
\left(\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}}\right)^{-1} = \left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

Verification can be performed using basic matrix operations and properties of transposes and inverses.

## Describe the identity involving the transpose of a product of matrices and provide the steps required to verify this identity through index manipulation.

The identity for the transpose of a product of matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is:

$$
(\mathbf{A B})^{\mathrm{T}} = \mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

Verification can be done by expanding the indices explicitly.

## Using the properties of transposes and inverses provided, show how to verify the expressions $(\mathbf{A B})^{-1}=\mathbf{B}^{-1}\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ and $\left(\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}}\right)^{-1}=\left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}$.

Verification of inverses and transposes can be performed systematically using the given matrix properties. Specifically:

1. Show that $(\mathbf{A B})^{-1} = \mathbf{B}^{-1} \mathbf{A}^{-1}$ by directly multiplying both sides.
2. Demonstrate that $\left(\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}}\right)^{-1} = \left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}$ by compatibility of multiplication and properties of transposes.
