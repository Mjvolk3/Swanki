## What is the derivative of a matrix product with respect to a variable x?

The derivative of the matrix product $\mathbf{A B}$ with respect to a variable $x$ is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\mathbf{A B})=\frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial x} \mathbf{B}+\mathbf{A} \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial x}
$$

This result utilizes the product rule of differentiation applied to matrix products. In this expression, $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are matrices, and $\frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial x}$ represent the derivative of the matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ with respect to $x$, respectively.

## What is the expression for the derivative of the inverse of a matrix?

The derivative of the inverse of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ with respect to $x$ can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\right)=-\mathbf{A}^{-1} \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial x} \mathbf{A}^{-1}
$$

This result can be derived by differentiating the identity $\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}$ using the product rule and then right-multiplying by $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ to isolate the desired derivative.

## How can we express the trace of the derivative of the determinant of a matrix A?

For a given matrix $\mathbf{A}$, the trace of the derivative of the natural logarithm of the determinant of $\mathbf{A}$ with respect to $x$ is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \ln |\mathbf{A}| = \operatorname{Tr}\left(\mathbf{A}^{-1} \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial x}\right)
```

The trace operator $\operatorname{Tr}$ sums the diagonal elements of the matrix. This formula follows from properties of the determinant and the matrix logarithm.

## What is the result of differentiating the trace of a product of matrices with respect to one matrix?

If $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are matrices, the differentiation of the trace of their product with respect to the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{A}} \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A B})=\mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

In this expression, $\operatorname{Tr}$ denotes the trace of the matrix, and $\mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}}$ is the transpose of the matrix $\mathbf{B}. This result can be seen by writing out the matrices in index notation.

## What are the properties of matrix differentiation when tracing multiple forms?

For matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, the properties of differentiation under the trace operator include:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{A}} \operatorname{Tr}\left(\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{B}\right) & =\mathbf{B} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{A}} \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A}) & =\mathbf{I} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{A}} \operatorname{Tr}\left(\mathbf{A B} \mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}}\right) & =\mathbf{A}\left(\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

These properties follow from the linearity of the trace operator and the rules of matrix differentiation.

## What is the derivative of the natural logarithm of a matrix determinant with respect to the matrix itself?

The derivative of $\ln |\mathbf{A}|$ with respect to the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{A}} \ln |\mathbf{A}|=\left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

This derivative results from combining the expression for the trace of the derivative of $\ln |\mathbf{A}|$ and the properties of matrix differentiation.
