## Considering the properties of transposes and inverses, explain and verify the relationship $(\mathbf{A B})^{\mathrm{T}}=\mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}}$

Given matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, the transpose of their product can be found as:

$$
(\mathbf{A B})^{\mathrm{T}} = \mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

To verify this, consider the definitions of the matrices and their corresponding elements.

## Demonstrate how the inverse of a product of matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ can be represented in terms of the inverses of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$.

The inverse of the product of two matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is given by:

$$
(\mathbf{A B})^{-1} = \mathbf{B}^{-1} \mathbf{A}^{-1}
$$

This can be shown by multiplying both sides and confirming the identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$ is obtained.

- #linear-algebra, #matrix-operations

---

## Define and mathematically verify the identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$ as it relates to matrix inverses.

For any invertible matrix $\mathbf{A}$, the identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$ satisfies:

$$
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}
$$

This is the foundational property of matrix inverses, ensuring that multiplying a matrix by its inverse gives the identity matrix.

## Explain the result $\left(\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}}\right)^{-1}=\left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}$ for invertible matrices and demonstrate its verification.

If $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, then the transpose of its inverse is equal to the inverse of its transpose:

$$
\left(\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}}\right)^{-1} = \left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

Verification can be performed using basic matrix operations and properties of transposes and inverses.

The identity for the transpose of a product of matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is:

Verification of inverses and transposes can be performed systematically using the given matrix properties. Specifically:

1. Show that $(\mathbf{A B})^{-1} = \mathbf{B}^{-1} \mathbf{A}^{-1}$ by directly multiplying both sides.

### Card 1

A useful identity involving matrix inverses is the following:
$$
\left(\mathbf{P}^{-1}+\mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{R}^{-1} \mathbf{B}\right)^{-1} \mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{R}^{-1}=\mathbf{P B}^{\mathrm{T}}\left(\mathbf{B} \mathbf{P} \mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}}+\mathbf{R}\right)^{-1}
$$

Verify this identity by right-multiplying both sides by $\left(\mathbf{B P B}^{\mathrm{T}}+\mathbf{R}\right)$.

$$
\left(\mathbf{P}^{-1}+\mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{R}^{-1} \mathbf{B}\right)^{-1} \mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{R}^{-1} = \mathbf{P B}^{\mathrm{T}} \left(\mathbf{B P B}^{\mathrm{T}}+\mathbf{R}\right)^{-1}
$$

By right-multiplying both sides by $\left(\mathbf{B P B}^{\mathrm{T}}+\mathbf{R}\right)$, we obtain:
$$
\left( \left(\mathbf{P}^{-1}+\mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{R}^{-1} \mathbf{B}\right)^{-1} \mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{R}^{-1} \right) \left(\mathbf{B P B}^{\mathrm{T}}+\mathbf{R}\right) = \mathbf{P B}^{\mathrm{T}} \left(\mathbf{B P B}^{\mathrm{T}}+\mathbf{R} \right) \left(\mathbf{B P B}^{\mathrm{T}}+\mathbf{R}\right)^{-1}
$$

Simplifying both sides, we get:
$$
\mathbf{P B}^{\mathrm{T}} = \mathbf{P B}^{\mathrm{T}}
$$
This verifies the identity.

### Card 2

In the context of matrix determinants, what is the trace of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and how is it defined?

The trace $\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A})$ of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is defined as the sum of the elements on the leading diagonal:
$$
\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A}) = \sum_{i} A_{ii}
$$

- #linear-algebra, #matrix-theory

### Card 3

Using the cyclic property of the trace operator, show that $\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A B C}) = \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{B C A})$.

The trace of the product of matrices $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{B}$, and $\mathbf{C}$ has the following cyclic property:
$$
\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A B C}) = \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{B C A}) = \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{C A B})
$$

This can be shown using the definition of the trace:
$$
\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A B C}) = \sum_{i} (\mathbf{A B C})_{ii} = \sum_{i} \sum_{j} \sum_{k} A_{ij} B_{jk} C_{ki}
$$
By rearranging the summation indices, we see that:
$$
\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A B C}) = \sum_{j} \sum_{k} \sum_{i} B_{jk} C_{ki} A_{ij} = \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{B C A})
$$

### Card 4

What is the Woodbury identity for matrix inversion, and why is it useful?

The Woodbury identity for matrix inversion is given by:
$$
\left(\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B D}^{-1} \mathbf{C}\right)^{-1}=\mathbf{A}^{-1}-\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{B}\left(\mathbf{D}+\mathbf{C A}^{-1} \mathbf{B}\right)^{-1} \mathbf{C A}^{-1}
$$

This is useful when $\mathbf{A}$ is large and diagonal (hence easy to invert) and $\mathbf{B}$ has many rows but few columns (and conversely for $\mathbf{C}$). It makes the inverse significantly cheaper to compute.

### Card 5

Given the relation $\sum_{n} \alpha_{n} \mathbf{a}_{n}=0$, what is the condition for the set of vectors $\left\{\mathbf{a}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{a}_{N}\right\}$ to be linearly independent?

A set of vectors $\left\{\mathbf{a}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{a}_{N}\right\}$ is linearly independent if:
$$
\sum_{n} \alpha_{n} \mathbf{a}_{n}=0 \Rightarrow \alpha_{n}=0 \, \forall \, n
$$

This implies that none of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the other vectors.

### Card 6

What is the determinant $|\mathbf{A}|$ of an $N \times N$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$, and what does it mean for the permutation $i_{1} i_{2} \ldots i_{N}$ to be even or odd?

The determinant $|\mathbf{A}|$ of an $N \times N$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is defined by:
$$
|\mathbf{A}| = \sum( \pm 1) A_{1 i_{1}} A_{2 i_{2}} \cdots A_{N i_{N}}
$$

The sum is taken over all products consisting of precisely one element from each row and one element from each column, with a coefficient +1 or -1 according to whether the permutation $i_{1} i_{2} \ldots i_{N}$ is even or odd, respectively.

An even permutation has an even number of inversions (where an inversion is a pair where a larger number precedes a smaller one). An odd permutation has an odd number of inversions.

$$
|\mathbf{A}|=\left|\begin{array}{ll}
a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{array}\right|

## Determinant of a Product of Two Matrices

The determinant of a product of two matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is given by:

$$
|\mathbf{AB}| = |\mathbf{A}||\mathbf{B}|
$$

Explain why this property holds for the determinants of matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$.

This property results from the multilinearity of the determinant function and the way matrix multiplication distributes across rows and columns.

### Card 3
## Determinant of an Inverse Matrix

The determinant of an inverse matrix $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ is given by:

$$
\left|\mathbf{A}^{-1}\right|=\frac{1}{|\mathbf{A}|}
$$

Derive this formula for the determinant of the inverse matrix $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$. 

We start by using the identity $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mathbf{I}$. Taking the determinant on both sides:

$$
|\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^{-1}| = |\mathbf{I}|
$$

Since $|\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^{-1}| = |\mathbf{A}||\mathbf{A}^{-1}|$, and $|\mathbf{I}| = 1$, we get:

$$
|\mathbf{A}||\mathbf{A}^{-1}| = 1 \implies |\mathbf{A}^{-1}| = \frac{1}{|\mathbf{A}|}

## Determinant of Specific Matrix Sum

When $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are matrices of size $N \times M$, the determinant of the matrix sum $\mathbf{I}_N + \mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}}$ is given by:

$$
\left|\mathbf{I}_{N}+\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}}\right|=\left|\mathbf{I}_{M}+\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{B}\right|
$$

Briefly explain why this determinant equality holds.

This equality holds because of the properties of determinants and the specific structure of identity matrices influencing the rank and product of the matrices involved.

## Special Case Determinant of Matrix Sum

A useful special case for column vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ of dimension $N$ is given by:

$$
\left|\mathbf{I}_{N}+\mathbf{a b}^{\mathrm{T}}\right|=1+\mathbf{a}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{b}
$$

Explain how the determinant in this special case simplifies to the above expression.

Since $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are vectors, $\mathbf{a}\mathbf{b}^{\mathrm{T}}$ is a rank-1 update of the identity matrix. The Sherman-Morrison formula provides a direct way to compute the determinant in this context.

## Vector Derivative

The derivative of a vector $\mathbf{a}$ with respect to a scalar $x$ is defined as a vector. The components are given by:

$$
\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{a}}{\partial x}\right)_{i}=\frac{\partial a_{i}}{\partial x}
$$

Explain the significance of this definition and provide an example.

This definition allows us to compute how each component of the vector $\mathbf{a}$ changes with respect to the scalar $x$. For example, if $\mathbf{a} = [x^2, \sin(x)]$, then:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{a}}{\partial x} = \left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial x}x^2, \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\sin(x) \right] = [2x, \cos(x)]
$$

## What is the derivative of a matrix product with respect to a variable x?

The derivative of the matrix product $\mathbf{A B}$ with respect to a variable $x$ is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\mathbf{A B})=\frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial x} \mathbf{B}+\mathbf{A} \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial x}
$$

This result utilizes the product rule of differentiation applied to matrix products. In this expression, $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are matrices, and $\frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial x}$ represent the derivative of the matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ with respect to $x$, respectively.

## What is the expression for the derivative of the inverse of a matrix?

The derivative of the inverse of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ with respect to $x$ can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\right)=-\mathbf{A}^{-1} \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial x} \mathbf{A}^{-1}
$$

This result can be derived by differentiating the identity $\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}$ using the product rule and then right-multiplying by $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ to isolate the desired derivative.

## How can we express the trace of the derivative of the determinant of a matrix A?

For a given matrix $\mathbf{A}$, the trace of the derivative of the natural logarithm of the determinant of $\mathbf{A}$ with respect to $x$ is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \ln |\mathbf{A}| = \operatorname{Tr}\left(\mathbf{A}^{-1} \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial x}\right)
```

The trace operator $\operatorname{Tr}$ sums the diagonal elements of the matrix. This formula follows from properties of the determinant and the matrix logarithm.

## What is the result of differentiating the trace of a product of matrices with respect to one matrix?

If $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are matrices, the differentiation of the trace of their product with respect to the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{A}} \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A B})=\mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

In this expression, $\operatorname{Tr}$ denotes the trace of the matrix, and $\mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}}$ is the transpose of the matrix $\mathbf{B}. This result can be seen by writing out the matrices in index notation.

## What are the properties of matrix differentiation when tracing multiple forms?

For matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, the properties of differentiation under the trace operator include:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{A}} \operatorname{Tr}\left(\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{B}\right) & =\mathbf{B} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{A}} \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A}) & =\mathbf{I} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{A}} \operatorname{Tr}\left(\mathbf{A B} \mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}}\right) & =\mathbf{A}\left(\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{B}^{\mathrm{T}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

These properties follow from the linearity of the trace operator and the rules of matrix differentiation.

## What is the derivative of the natural logarithm of a matrix determinant with respect to the matrix itself?

The derivative of $\ln |\mathbf{A}|$ with respect to the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is given by:

\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{A}} \ln |\mathbf{A}|=\left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

This derivative results from combining the expression for the trace of the derivative of $\ln |\mathbf{A}|$ and the properties of matrix differentiation.

## Define the characteristic equation for eigenvalues $\lambda_i$.

The characteristic equation is defined as:

$$
\left|\mathbf{A}-\lambda_{i} \mathbf{I}\right|=0

## What property do the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix possess according to the given paper?

For symmetric matrices, the eigenvalues $\lambda_{i}$ are:

$$
\lambda_{i}^{\star}=\lambda_{i}
$$

Hence, $\lambda_{i}$ must be real.

## Describe the orthonormal property of eigenvectors $\mathbf{u}_i$ of a real symmetric matrix.

The eigenvectors $\mathbf{u}_{i}$ of a real symmetric matrix can be chosen to be orthonormal such that:

$$
\mathbf{u}_{i}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{u}_{j}=I_{i j}
$$

where $I_{i j}$ are the elements of the identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$.

- #linear-algebra, #eigenvectors.orthonormal-property


## How do you demonstrate the orthogonality of eigenvectors $\mathbf{u}_i$ and $\mathbf{u}_j$ with distinct eigenvalues?

To prove this, we consider:

$$
\mathbf{u}_{j}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{u}_{i}=\lambda_{i} \mathbf{u}_{j}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{u}_{i}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{u}_{i}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{u}_{j}=\lambda_{j} \mathbf{u}_{i}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{u}_{j}
$$

Subtracting these equations after taking the transpose, we get:

$$
\left(\lambda_{i}-\lambda_{j}\right) \mathbf{u}_{i}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{u}_{j}=0
$$

For $\lambda_{i} \neq \lambda_{j}$, $\mathbf{u}_{i}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{u}_{j} = 0$ which indicates orthogonality.

- #linear-algebra, #eigenvectors.orthogonality


## Why are the eigenvalues of symmetric matrices real?

Taking the complex conjugate and left-multiplying yields:

$$
\mathbf{u}_{i}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{u}_{i}^{\star}=\lambda_{i}^{\star} \mathbf{u}_{i}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{u}_{i}^{\star}
$$

Due to the symmetry property $\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{T}}=\mathbf{A}$ and using real matrices $\mathbf{A}$, we equate the left-hand sides of two equations to show $\lambda_{i}^{\star} = \lambda_{i}$, implying $\lambda_{i}$ must be real.

## What is the condition for a solution to the set of simultaneous homogeneous linear equations involving the eigenvector $\mathbf{u}_{i}$ and eigenvalue $\lambda_{i}$?

The given condition is:

$$

$$

This is known as the characteristic equation of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$.

- #linear-algebra, #homogeneous-equations.solution-criteria

## What does the orthonormality condition for an $M \times M$ matrix $\mathbf{U}$ imply?
The orthonormality condition for an $M \times M$ matrix $\mathbf{U}$ implies that the product of $\mathbf{U}$ and its transpose $\mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}}$ results in the identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$.

$$
\mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{U} = \mathbf{I}
$$

This also means that $\mathbf{U}$ is an orthogonal matrix. Consequently, the rows and columns of $\mathbf{U}$ are orthogonal and normalized to unit length.

- #linear-algebra, #orthogonal-matrix, #eigenvectors

## How can we express any $M$-dimensional vector in terms of the eigenvectors of a matrix with $M$ eigenvalues?
Any $M$-dimensional vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the $M$ orthonormal eigenvectors of a matrix with $M$ eigenvalues. The eigenvectors form a complete set, allowing for this representation.

For a given matrix $\mathbf{A}$ with eigenvectors $\mathbf{u}_i$, an $M$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{x}$ can be expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^{M} c_i \mathbf{u}_i
$$

where $c_i$ are coefficients.

## How is the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ diagonalized using an orthogonal matrix $\mathbf{U}$ and what does it achieve?
The matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is diagonalized using an orthogonal matrix $\mathbf{U}$ by the transformation:

$$
\mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{U} = \boldsymbol{\Lambda}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ on the diagonal. This transformation simplifies $\mathbf{A}$ into a diagonal form, making it easier to analyze.

- #linear-algebra, #matrix-diagonalization, #orthogonal-matrix

## How can we find the inverse of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ using its diagonalization and an orthogonal matrix $\mathbf{U}$?
To find the inverse of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$, given its diagonal representation with an orthogonal matrix $\mathbf{U}$, we use:

$$
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{U} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

Taking the inverse, and knowing $\mathbf{U}^{-1} = \mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}}$, we have:

$$
\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mathbf{U} \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{-1} \mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

This method leverages the simplified diagonal form $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$.

- #linear-algebra, #matrix-inversion, #orthogonal-matrix

## What property of an orthogonal matrix $\mathbf{U}$ verifies that the transformation $\widetilde{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{U x}$ preserves vector length?
The transformation $\widetilde{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{U x}$ preserves vector length due to the property:

$$
\widetilde{\mathbf{x}}^{\mathrm{T}} \widetilde{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{U} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}
$$

This ensures that the original length of vector $\mathbf{x}$ is maintained in the transformed vector $\widetilde{\mathbf{x}}$.

- #linear-algebra, #orthogonal-transformation, #vector-length-preservation

## How does the orthogonal transformation $\widetilde{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{U x}$ preserve the angle between two vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$?
The orthogonal transformation $\widetilde{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{U x}$ preserves the angle between two vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ through:

$$
\widetilde{\mathbf{x}}^{\mathrm{T}} \widetilde{\mathbf{y}} = \mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{U} \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{y}
$$

This implies that the dot product (and thus the angle) between $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ remains unchanged after the transformation.

## Explain the determinants and traces relationship for a symmetric matrix using eigenvalues.

For a symmetric matrix $\mathbf{A}$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_i$, the determinant and trace of $\mathbf{A}$ are given by:

$$
|\mathbf{A}| = \prod_{i=1}^{M} \lambda_{i}
$$

and

$$
\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A})=\sum_{i=1}^{M} \lambda_{i}
$$

Explain the significance of these expressions and how they relate to the properties of $\mathbf{A}$.

%

The determinant $|\mathbf{A}|$ reflects the scaled volume transformation described by $\mathbf{A}$ and is zero if any $\lambda_i$ is zero, indicating singularity. The trace $\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A})$, on the other hand, is the sum of eigenvalues, giving a measure of the cumulative stretch applied by $\mathbf{A}$ over its axes.

## Define and explain the condition number of a matrix.

The condition number of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$, particularly in the context of its eigenvalues, is defined by:

$$
\mathrm{CN}=\left(\frac{\lambda_{\max }}{\lambda_{\min }}\right)^{1 / 2}
$$

where $\lambda_{\max}$ and $\lambda_{\min}$ are the largest and smallest eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$, respectively.

%

The condition number measures how much the output value of the function can change for a small change in the input, indicating the sensitivity of the matrix. A high condition number implies that the matrix is close to singular and may lead to numerical instability in calculations.

## Describe the criteria for a matrix to be positive definite or positive semidefinite.

Given a matrix $\mathbf{A}$, define the criteria for it to be classified as positive definite or positive semidefinite.

%

A matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is positive definite, denoted $\mathbf{A} \succ 0$, if $\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{A w}>0$ for all non-zero vectors $\mathbf{w}$. Equivalently, all its eigenvalues $\lambda_i > 0$.

A matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is positive semidefinite, denoted $\mathbf{A} \succeq 0$, if $\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{A w} \geq 0$ for all vectors $\mathbf{w}$, which is equivalent to $\lambda_i \geq 0$ for all eigenvalues.

Analyze the eigenvalues of the matrix

and determine whether it is positive definite or not.

%

The given matrix has eigenvalues $\lambda_{1} \simeq 5.37$ and $\lambda_{2} \simeq -0.37$. Since one of the eigenvalues is negative, the matrix is not positive definite. A matrix is not positive definite if any eigenvalue $\lambda_i \leq 0$.

|\mathbf{A}|=\prod_{i=1}^{M} \lambda_{i}
$$

$$
\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A})=\sum_{i=1}^{M} \lambda_{i}
$$

%

The expression $|\mathbf{A}|=\prod_{i=1}^{M} \lambda_{i}$ represents the determinant of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$, which is the product of its eigenvalues. This gives us an idea of the overall scaling effect of $\mathbf{A}$.

The expression $\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{A}) = \sum_{i=1}^{M} \lambda_{i}$ represents the trace of the matrix, which is the sum of its eigenvalues. This provides insights into the aggregate influence of $\mathbf{A}$ along its principal directions.
