We want the lecture transcript to be presented as an audiobook. This means that it really needs to readability qualities. We find that authors like Philip Ball (How Life Works), David Deutsch (The beginning of Infinity), Douglas Hofstadter (GEB),  Peter M Hoffmann (Life's Ratchet) to be good characters to emulate for lecture transcript.
