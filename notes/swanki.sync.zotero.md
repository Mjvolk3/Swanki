## 2026.04.03 - Zotero attachment upload for Swanki outputs

Uploads apkg and audio files as timestamped child attachments on the corresponding Zotero library item, enabling automatic sync to other machines via Zotero's built-in sync.

- **Timestamped filenames**: `{citation_key}-{type}-{YYYYMMDDTHHMI}-{git_hash}.{ext}` — versions accumulate, old ones pruned manually.
- **Item lookup**: Splits camelCase citation key into search words, matches against the `extra` field where Better BibTeX stores citation keys.
- **Sync log**: Creates/appends to a "Swanki Sync Log" child note on the Zotero item documenting each upload.
- **Git hash**: Embeds abbreviated commit hash in filenames for traceability back to the code version that generated the output.
- **Hydra config**: `zotero=sync` enables upload; off by default. Credentials from `.env` (`ZOTERO_API_KEY`, `ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID`).
