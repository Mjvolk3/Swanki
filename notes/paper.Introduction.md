Common learning and memory best practices including retrieval practice, spaced repetition, interleaved practice, and elaborative encoding are all supported by Anki, the spaced repetition flashcard application [@bradshawElaborativeEncodingExplanation1982; @polkLearningBrain; @kornellOptimisingSelfregulatedStudy2008; @santos-ferreiraDigitalFlashcardsMedical2024; @phdMindNumbersHow2014] . Anki is popular among medical students United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step exams where students can download pre-made flashcards developed by by the community. Anki usage has been shown to be associated with higher USMLE Step 1 scores where more consistent users achieved higher scores @luEnhancedLearningRetention2021 . Anki offers extensive digital content formats including text, images, audio, and mathematical notation with LaTEX. Despite effectiveness of Anki and other flashcard apps in learning and memory, they are underutilized in other STEM disciplines. This could be due to a variety of reasons like long chains of reasoning not being easily amenable to flashcards, but we suspect that that a large reason is simply due to the cost of card creation or a limited view of flashcards only supporting rote memorization but the can also be viewed as quizzes of comprehension @senzakiReinventingFlashcardsIncrease2017 .

To fill this perceived gap we developed a python application named Swanki (pronounced "swanky") that takes pdfs as input and produces anki cards as output. We've additionally additionally optional audio including audio summaries, audio books, and complementary card audio that allow users to interact with material through their preferred medium.

There are recent anki plugins [AnkiBrain](https://github.com/RosettaTechnologies/AnkiBrain) for supporting the use of LLMs for card generation from source material. There also a number of online services that now allow for similar types of content creation including [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/), [Limbiks](https://www.limbiks.com/), [Anki-decks](https://anki-decks.com/), [Algor Education](https://www.algoreducation.com/en), [Knowt](https://knowt.com/), and many more. We differentiate primarily by making the entire content creation process configurable by the user so they can modify prompt to customize output and by supporting the creation of image cards and other optional audio options. During development we have found that it is difficult to know the depth of information that any one individual may desire. For example it can be difficult to create cards on implementation details of a multiline algorithm, but if the user specifies this by modifying provided prompt it become feasible.
