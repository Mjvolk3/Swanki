  abstract = {Three experiments were performed to study how elaboration of memory structures affects recall accuracy and response latency. The experiments introduce a methodology which can independently manipulate the amount and type of elaboration given to subjects. Using this methodology, it was shown that integrated, highly elaborated memory traces were better recalled than either small unelaborated traces or large, poorly integrated traces. The results have implications for current analyses of levels of processing phenomena, and were found to support the encoding elaboration model (J. R. Anderson \& L. M. Reder, Levels of processing in human memory. Hillsdale, N.J.: Erlbaum, 1979).},

  abstract = {CRISPR-Cas technology has revolutionized biology by enabling precise DNA and RNA edits with ease. However, significant challenges remain for translating this technology into clinical applications. Traditional protein engineering methods, such as rational design, mutagenesis screens, and directed evolution, have been used to address issues like low efficacy, specificity, and high immunogenicity. These methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and resource-intensive and often require detailed structural knowledge. Recently, computational strategies have emerged as powerful solutions to these limitations. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the discovery and design of novel gene-editing enzymes can be streamlined. AI/ML models predict activity, specificity, and immunogenicity while also enhancing mutagenesis screens and directed evolution. These approaches not only accelerate rational design but also create new opportunities for developing safer and more efficient genome-editing tools, which could eventually be translated into the clinic.},

  abstract = {The companion book to COURSERA{\textregistered}'s wildly popular massive open online course "Learning How to Learn"Whether you are a student struggling to fulfill a math or science requirement, or you are embarking on a career change that requires a new skill set, A Mind for Numbers offers the tools you need to get a better grasp of that intimidating material. Engineering professor Barbara Oakley knows firsthand how it feels to struggle with math. She flunked her way through high school math and science courses, before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation. When she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her options---both to rise in the military and to explore other careers---she returned to school with a newfound determination to re-tool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life. ~ In A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to learning effectively---secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they'd known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that there's only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutions---you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. The learning strategies in this book apply not only to math and science, but to any subject in which we struggle. We all have what it takes to excel in areas that don't seem to come naturally to us at first, and learning them does not have to be as painful as we might think.},

  abstract = {Use of digital flashcards promotes active recall, spaced repetition, and self-assessment academic principles. This work explores the association and dose-dependent effect of this study method and locomotor (LP) and cardiovascular physiology (CP) grades. A single-faculty cohort study of medical LP and CP students was conducted, and 155 and 676 flashcards, respectively, were created through Moodle. An exploratory analysis examined three exam results (2019), and a confirmatory study used a fourth exam (2021) in another CP cohort. Of 685 students enrolled, 558 participated in the exploratory analysis: 319 (69\%) for LP and 311 (84\%) for CP, of which 203 LP and 267 CP students were flashcard users. Median grades were higher among flashcard users, and the number of cards reviewed was positively correlated with grades (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.275 to 0.388 for LP and r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.239 to 0.432 for CP, P {$<$} 0.001). Multiple linear regression models confirmed a positive dose-dependent association between results and the number of flashcards studied: for every 100 LP cards reviewed, exam grades increased 0.44--0.75 on a 0--20 scale range (P {$<$} 0.001), and for every 1,000 CP flashcards, results raised 0.81--1.08 values (P {$<$} 0.05). These findings were confirmed in the 2021 CP cohort of 269 participants, of whom 67\% were flashcard users. Digital flashcard revision has a consistent positive dose-dependent association on LP and CP grades.},

The strategy requires students to create flashcards designed to increase their ability to retain, comprehend, and apply textbook material to exams. In Studies 1a (n?=?73) and 1b (n?=?62), we introduced all students to the Flashcards-Plus method and compared their exam scores. Students who used this strategy scored significantly higher than those who did not. In Study 2 (n?=?434), we randomly assigned six introductory psychology courses to either receive a classroom lecture with the Flashcards-Plus strategy (i.e., three experimental courses) or no lecture (i.e., three control courses). Students in the experimental courses scored significantly higher than those in the control courses after the lecture. The results from all three studies demonstrate that students who were introduced to the Flashcards-Plus study strategy scored significantly higher on exams following the lecture than students who were not. These findings suggest that this easily implemented teaching strategy can help students achieve deeper levels of processing (i.e., comprehension and application) in a self-directed manner, which benefit students? performance.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, digital flashcards -- that is, computer programmes, smartphone apps, and online services that mimic, and potentially improve upon, the capabilities of traditional paper flashcards -- have grown in variety and popularity. Many digital flashcard platforms allow learners to make or use flashcards from a variety of sources and customise the way in which flashcards are used. Yet relatively little is known about why and how students actually use digital flashcards during self-regulated learning, and whether such uses are supported by research from the science of learning. To address these questions, we conducted a large survey of undergraduate students (n = 901) at a major U.S. university. The survey revealed insights into the popularity, acquisition, and usage of digital flashcards, beliefs about how digital flashcards are to be used during self-regulated learning, and differences in uses of paper versus digital flashcards, all of which have implications for the optimisation of student learning. Overall, our results suggest that college students commonly use digital flashcards in a manner that only partially reflects evidence-based learning principles, and as such, the pedagogical potential of digital flashcards remains to be fully realised.},
