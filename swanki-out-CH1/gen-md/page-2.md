## Briefly describe artificial general intelligence (AGI) and its contrast with machine learning.

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to the aspiration of building machines with capabilities that match the tremendous breadth and flexibility encountered in human intelligence. Unlike specific applications of machine learning designed to solve narrow tasks, AGI aims for machines to exhibit a much greater range of adaptability.

## How does deep learning differ from traditional approaches in solving various applications?

Deep learning uses variants of the same fundamental framework to address different applications, in contrast to traditional approaches that use different and specialized techniques for each application. This versatility demonstrates its broad applicability across various fields.

## In the context of medical diagnosis, explain how deep learning has been used to diagnose skin cancer.

Deep learning has been effectively leveraged to diagnose skin cancer, particularly melanoma, by training models on large sets of lesion images. These models can classify skin lesions as malignant or benign with high accuracy, which is remarkably challenging for traditional algorithmic approaches to achieve.

## Define melanoma and its significance in medical diagnosis.

Melanoma is the most dangerous kind of skin cancer that is curable if detected early. Its significance lies in the difficulty of distinguishing it from benign nevi, making accurate early diagnosis crucial for effective treatment.

## Explain why writing an algorithm by hand to classify melanoma images would be virtually impossible.

Classifying images of skin lesions, such as distinguishing malignant melanomas from benign nevi, is extremely challenging due to the subtle differences and complexity in the images. It would be nearly impossible to manually write an algorithm that could classify such images with any reasonable accuracy compared to deep learning models.
