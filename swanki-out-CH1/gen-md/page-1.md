## Describe the relationship between artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to recreate the capabilities of the human brain in machines. Today, the terms AI and machine learning are often used interchangeably. Machine learning is a subset of AI focused on the development of algorithms that allow machines to learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed.
