### 1. Analysis of Generalization Performance

Researchers aim to achieve good generalization by making accurate predictions for new data. To quantify this performance, they often use a separate set of data known as a test set. 

Describe how the generalization performance of a model for data points can be quantitatively assessed using a test set. 

The generalization performance can be evaluated by considering a test set, which is an additional set of data points generated with the same procedure as the training set. For each model with a different order $M$, we can evaluate the residual value of $E\left(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\right)$ given by the error function for both training and test data sets. This helps us compare model performances and identify over-fitting or under-fitting issues by comparing the error values across different values of $M$.

### 2. RMS Error Calculation

The root-mean-square (RMS) error is often more convenient to use than the raw error function $E(\mathbf{w})$. 

What is the formula for the RMS error, and why might it be more convenient to use?

$$
E_{\mathrm{RMS}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{y\left(x_{n}, \mathbf{w}\right)-t_{n}\right\}^{2}}
$$

The RMS error is convenient because the division by $N$ allows us to compare different sizes of data sets equally, and the square root ensures that $E_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ is measured in the same units as the target variable $t_n$.

### 3. Minimizing Error Function

Given training data points, we fit polynomials of various orders $M$ by minimizing an error function. 

Explain the concept and implications of minimizing the error function $E(\mathbf{w})$ for fitting polynomial data.

Minimizing $E(\mathbf{w})$ ensures that the fitted polynomial passes through the data points as closely as possible. However, a polynomial that minimizes the error to zero (i.e., $E\left(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\right)=0$) might oscillate wildly, representing over-fitting. Over-fitting means the model captures noise in the training data, giving poor generalization to new data.

### 4. Error Function Definition

The error function $E(\mathbf{w})$ is critical in fitting models to data.

What role does the error function $E(\mathbf{w})$ play in model fitting, and how is it typically formulated?

The error function $E(\mathbf{w})$ quantifies the difference between the predicted outputs $y\left(x_n, \mathbf{w}\right)$ and the actual target values $t_n$. It is typically formulated as

$$
E(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left\{ y\left(x_n, \mathbf{w}\right) - t_n \right\}^2
$$

Minimizing this error function during training ensures the model aligns closely with the given data points.

### 5. The Concept of Over-Fitting

When fitting polynomials to data, over-fitting can occur.

What is over-fitting, and how does it affect model performance?

Over-fitting occurs when a model fits the training data too well, capturing noise and fluctuations that do not represent the actual underlying trend. This behavior results in a fitted curve that passes exactly through each data point but oscillates wildly, providing a poor generalization for new data. It occurs particularly with high-order polynomials.
