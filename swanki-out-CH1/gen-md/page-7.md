## What is the significance of the number $P$ in the proof of infinitely many primes?

The number $P$ is assumed to be the largest prime number. The proof demonstrates that under this assumption we can construct a number $Q$ which is also prime and larger than $P$, thereby leading to a contradiction and proving that no largest prime number exists.

## Explain how the number $Q$ is constructed in the proof of infinitely many primes.

The number $Q$ is constructed by multiplying all prime numbers from $2$ up to $P$ (the supposed largest prime) and then adding $1$ to the product. This can be seen as:

$$
Q = (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdots P) + 1
$$

## Fill in the missing concept: The proof shows that the number $Q$ is not divisible by any of the primes from $2$ to $P$ because {{c1:: the remainder is always 1 when $Q$ is divided by any of these primes.}}

The proof shows that the number $Q$ is not divisible by any of the primes from $2$ to $P$ because {{c1:: the remainder is always 1 when $Q$ is divided by any of these primes.}}

## When constructing the number $Q$ from the assumed largest prime $P$, why does adding $1$ ensure that none of the primes up to $P$ can divide $Q$?

When constructing $Q$, which is $(2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot P) + 1$, adding $1$ ensures that none of the primes up to $P$ can divide $Q$ because:

$$
Q \equiv 1 \pmod{p_i}
$$

for any prime $p_i \leq P$. Since the remainder is 1, $Q$ cannot be divisible by any of these primes.

## What logical method is used in the proof to show that there is no largest prime number?

The proof employs a proof by contradiction. It starts with the assumption that there is a largest prime number $P$, constructs a number $Q$ that is larger and also prime, thereby leading to a contradiction and thereby concluding that no largest prime, $P$, exists.
