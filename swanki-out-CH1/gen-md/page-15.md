## Explain the steps involved in $S$-fold cross-validation.

$S$-fold cross-validation involves the following steps:
1. Partition the dataset into $S$ equal-sized groups.
2. Take $S-1$ groups for training and 1 group for testing.
3. Rotate the test group through all possible $S$ choices.
4. Average the performance scores from all $S$ runs.

## Illustrate the proportion of data used for training in $S$-fold cross-validation.

In $S$-fold cross-validation, the proportion of data used for training is $(S-1)/S$. For instance, if $S=4$:
$$
\text{Training Proportion} = \frac{S-1}{S} = \frac{4-1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
$$

## Discuss the main drawback of using $S$-fold cross-validation for complex models.

The main drawback of $S$-fold cross-validation for complex models is the increased computational cost. The number of training runs is increased by a factor of $S$. For hyperparameter tuning, the cost can increase exponentially with the number of hyperparameters.

## What is the leave-one-out technique in cross-validation? When is it appropriate to use it?

The leave-one-out technique is a special case of $S$-fold cross-validation where $S=N$ (total number of data points). It uses $N-1$ data points for training and 1 for testing. It's appropriate when data is particularly scarce.

## Why can the error function in neural networks not be minimized through closed-form solutions?

Neural networks typically have highly nonlinear error functions with many parameters (often in the hundreds of billions). Thus, the error function must be minimized through iterative optimization techniques rather than closed-form solutions.
