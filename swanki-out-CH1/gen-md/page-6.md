---

## Explain the goal in the provided machine learning example using the figures and the terms \(x\) and \(t\).

The goal in the provided example is to predict the value of the target variable \( t \) for a new input value of \( x \), without knowing the function defined by the green curve $\sin(2\pi x)$ which was used to generate the data.

## Describe the process of generating the synthetic data set used for training in the 1.2.1 section. Include relevant key equations.

The synthetic data set is generated by the following process:

1. **Input Generation**: The input values \( x_n \) for \( n = 1, \ldots, N \) are spaced uniformly in the range $[0, 1]$.
2. **Target Generation**: The target values \( t_n \) are obtained by computing the function $\sin(2\pi x)$ for each \( x \).

$$
t_n = \sin(2\pi x_n) \quad \text{for} \quad n = 1, \ldots, 10 
$$

## Given a sinusoidal function, write the general form of the equation used to generate the synthetic data set described in the text.

The general form of the equation used to generate the synthetic data set is:

$$
t = \sin(2\pi x)
$$

Here, \(x\) denotes the input variable and \(t\) denotes the target variable.

## What is meant by "generalization" in the context of machine learning, as discussed in the text?

Generalization refers to the ability of a machine learning model to make accurate predictions on previously unseen inputs based on the patterns it has learned from the training data. In the given context, it is the goal of predicting the target variable \( t \) for new input values of \( x \).

## Explain the significance of the training data set plot (\(N=10\) points) shown in Figure 1.4. How does it help in understanding the example provided in the text?

The training data set plot (with \(N=10\) points) visually represents how the input variable \( x \) and the target variable \( t \) relate to each other. This helps understand the process of generating synthetic data using the function $\sin(2\pi x)$. It illustrates the goal of predicting \( t \) for new values of \( x \) by showing the known observations and their functional relationship.
