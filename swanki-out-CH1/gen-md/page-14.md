## How does the value of $\lambda$ affect the model parameters $\mathbf{w}$ in polynomial regression?

Consider a polynomial regression model $M = 9$. The quantity $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter whose values are fixed during the minimization of the error function to determine the model parameters $\mathbf{w}$.

$$
\lambda \rightarrow 0
$$

This would lead to an over-fitted model with small or zero training error. Conversely, increasing $\lambda$ regularizes the model by penalizing large values of $\mathbf{w}$.

## Why is cross-validation useful in determining suitable hyperparameters?

For some applications, especially where the supply of data for training and testing is limited, cross-validation provides a way to use as much of the available data as possible for training while still having a mechanism to assess the model.

Using cross-validation helps to mitigate the risks of overfitting by partitioning data into training and validation sets multiple times, thereby providing a more reliable estimate of model performance.

## What is the effect of $\ln \lambda = -\infty$ on the coefficients $w_i^{\star}$ for an $M=9$ polynomial?

When $\ln \lambda = -\infty$, it corresponds to a model with no regularization. Hence, the coefficients $w_i^{\star}$ can take large values as shown in the table.

For instance:
$$
w_3^{\star} = -15,566.61 \quad \text{when} \quad \ln \lambda = -\infty
$$

## Explain the relationship between $\ln \lambda$ and the magnitude of the model coefficients $w_i^{\star}$.

As $\ln \lambda$ increases, the magnitude of the model coefficients $w_i^{\star}$ generally decreases. This can be observed in the table where:

$$
w_3^{\star} = -15,566.61 \quad \text{for} \quad \ln \lambda = -\infty
$$

And

$$
w_3^{\star} = -0.07 \quad \text{for} \quad \ln \lambda = 0
$$

This indicates that higher values of $\ln \lambda$ exert a stronger regularization effect, curbing the magnitude of the coefficients.

## Describe the process of model selection using a separate validation set.

Model selection using a separate validation set involves the following steps:
1. Partition the available data into a training set and a validation set (also known as a hold-out set).
2. Use the training set to determine the model coefficients $\mathbf{w}$.
3. Evaluate the model on the validation set to select the model with the lowest validation error.

If there is a risk of over-fitting from reusing the validation data multiple times, a third test set can be kept aside for final model evaluation.
