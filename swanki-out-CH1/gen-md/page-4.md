## Describe the role of supervised learning in protein structure prediction.

The role of supervised learning in protein structure prediction is to train a neural network on a dataset where both the amino acid sequence and the 3D structure of proteins are known. Once trained, the network can predict the 3D structure of a new protein from its amino acid sequence.

## Explain how AlphaFold predicts protein structures and compare it to X-ray crystallography.

AlphaFold predicts protein structures by using a deep learning model to infer the 3D shape from an amino acid sequence. This prediction can be compared to the ground truth obtained from X-ray crystallography.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Predicted structure} \quad (\text{Blue}) \\
&\text{Ground truth} \quad (\text{Green})
\end{aligned}
$$

X-ray crystallography is a highly accurate, experimentally determined method to elucidate the 3D structure of proteins, while AlphaFold provides a computational approach.

## What differentiates the types of learning involved in lesion classification, protein structure prediction, and image synthesis?

Lesion classification and protein structure prediction are examples of supervised learning because the training data consists of labeled input-output pairs: skin images labeled with lesion types and amino acid sequences labeled with 3D structures. Image synthesis, on the other hand, is an example of unsupervised learning because it involves generating new images from an unlabelled set of sample images.

## Define and provide an example of a generative model in the context of deep learning.

A generative model in deep learning learns the underlying distribution of a dataset and generates new data samples that share the same statistical properties as the original dataset. For example, a deep neural network trained on images of human faces can generate new, high-quality synthetic images that are hard to distinguish from real photographs.

## How does the concept of "prompt" work in generative AI, particularly in image generation?

In generative AI, a "prompt" refers to an input text string that guides the content of the generated image. The deep learning model interprets the semantics of the text input and creates an image that reflects this input.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Input: "A cat sitting on a beach"} \quad (\text{Prompt}) \\
&\text{Output: Detailed image of a cat on a beach}
\end{aligned}
$$

This technique allows for tailored image generation based on textual descriptions.
