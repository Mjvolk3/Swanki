## What is a large language model (LLM) and what kind of data does it process?

A large language model (LLM) uses deep learning to build rich internal representations that capture the semantic properties of language. It processes natural language and other forms of sequential data such as source code.

## Describe the autoregressive property of large language models in generating text.

Autoregressive language models generate language by taking a sequence of words as input and generating the next word in the sequence as output. This augmented sequence can then be re-fed into the model to generate subsequent words, allowing for the generation of long sequences of text.

## Explain the self-supervised learning aspect of training large language models.

Large language models are trained on extensive datasets of text by using self-supervised learning. Here, training pairs are formed by taking randomly selected sequences of words as input and their known next words as target outputs. The learning occurs without the need for separate human-labelled data.

## What mechanism allows autoregressive language models to generate text of finite length?

Autoregressive language models can generate text of finite length by outputting a special 'stop' word that signals the end of text generation. This allows the model to halt after producing a sequence of text.

## How can humans interact with autoregressive language models to create a conversation?

Humans can interact with autoregressive language models by appending their own series of words to a generated sequence and feeding the complete sequence back through the model. This triggers further word generation and allows for a conversational interaction with the neural network.
