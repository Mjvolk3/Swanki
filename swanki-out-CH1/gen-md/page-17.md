## Mathematical representation of a neuron's pre-activation and activation

In a neural network, the pre-activation and activation of a single neuron are mathematically described as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a & =\sum_{i=1}^{M} w_{i} x_{i} \\
y & =f(a)
\end{aligned}
$$

Explain the meaning of variable $a$ in the context of a neural network's pre-activation and activation.

The variable $a$ represents the pre-activation value of a neuron, which is a weighted sum of its inputs. Specifically:

$$
a = \sum_{i=1}^{M} w_{i} x_{i}
$$

Where:
- $M$ is the number of inputs,
- $w_i$ are the weights associated with these inputs, and
- $x_i$ are the input values from other neurons.

## Definition of the activation function in a simple neural network

Given the pre-activation value $a$, the activation value $y$ is then determined by the activation function $f(a)$, which can vary based on the neural network model.

What is the activation function $f(a)$ in the single-layer neural network context, particularly in the model first introduced by Rosenblatt?

In the context of Rosenblatt's perceptron, the activation function $f(a)$ is a step function defined as:

$$
f(a)= 
\begin{cases} 
0, & \text { if } a \leqslant 0 \\ 
1, & \text { if } a > 0 
\end{cases}
$$

This function outputs 0 if the pre-activation $a$ is less than or equal to 0, and 1 otherwise.

## How can polynomial function (1.1) be seen as a special case of the pre-activation and activation model in neural networks?

Explain how the polynomial function (1.1) can be viewed within the framework of the pre-activation and activation model defined in (1.5) and (1.6).

The polynomial function (1.1) can be viewed as a special case of the pre-activation and activation model if we choose the inputs $x_i$ as powers of a single variable $x$ and set the activation function $f(a)$ to be the identity function, $f(a)=a$. This reformulates the general weighted sum model to a polynomial summation.

## Properties of the Perceptron Training Algorithm

Describe a key property of the training algorithm for the perceptron, particularly in terms of its solution finding and convergence.

The perceptron training algorithm, as developed by Rosenblatt (1962), has the notable property that if a set of weight values exists allowing the perceptron to perfectly classify its training data, then the algorithm is guaranteed to find this solution in a finite number of steps [Bishop, 2006].

## Evolution of neural network sophistication

Summarize the evolution of neural networks in terms of their processing sophistication and the number of layers from historical single-layer models to more complex architectures.

The history of artificial neural networks can be divided into three broad phases based on the sophistication of their architectures:
1. Single-layer networks, simple models such as the one described by (1.5) and (1.6), and notably the perceptron.
2. Multi-layer networks, increasing sophistication with more layers of neurons.
3. Deep learning, with architectures containing many layers, allowing for complex feature representation and learning.
