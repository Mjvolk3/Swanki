## What was a significant advancement in the field of neural networks during the second decade of the 21st century?

A significant advancement was the ability to train neural networks with many layers of weights effectively, leading to the emergence of deep neural networks. This development allowed for networks beyond just two or three layers, which were previously constrained.

## What is the relationship between the number of parameters in neural networks and the size of data sets required for effective training?

Neural networks with a large number of parameters require commensurately large data sets to produce good values for those parameters. This ensures that the training signals are sufficient to learn the appropriate parameters.

## Why are GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) particularly well-suited for training large-scale neural networks?

GPUs are well-suited for training large-scale neural networks because the functions computed by the units in one layer of a network can be evaluated in parallel. This parallelism maps well onto the architecture of GPUs, allowing for efficient computation of large neural networks.

## What was a limitation observed in early neural networks with many layers before the advent of deep learning?

In early neural networks with many layers, it was observed that only the weights in the final two layers would learn useful values, while the other layers remained ineffective. This limitation was a significant barrier to the complexity and performance of neural networks until deep learning methods were introduced.
