## How is the goal of the trained network described for the classification problem in the context of skin lesion detection?

The goal is for the trained network to predict the correct label for a new lesion just from the image alone, without needing the time-consuming step of a biopsy.

## What does the term "transfer learning" refer to, and how is it used in the context of training a deep neural network for skin lesion classification?

Transfer learning refers to the method of first training a deep neural network on a much larger dataset of everyday objects and then fine-tuning it on a smaller, specific dataset (in this case, lesion images). This helps the network learn general properties from the larger dataset and specialize in the task using the smaller dataset.

## What distinguishes a supervised learning problem from a regression problem in the context of the paper?

In supervised learning problems, each training example has an associated correct label, as opposed to regression problems where the outputs are continuous variables. In the given context, predicting whether a lesion is malignant or benign is a supervised learning problem as it involves classifying discrete classes.

## Explain the difference between the methods used to determine the 3D structure of proteins and the advantages of using deep learning to predict the 3D structure directly from amino acid sequences.

The 3D structure of proteins can be measured using techniques such as X-ray crystallography, cryogenic electron microscopy, or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These methods are time-consuming and challenging for some proteins. A deep learning model can predict the 3D structure from amino acid sequences, reducing time and increasing throughput.

## What fundamental open problem in biology has deep learning significantly impacted, according to the paper?

Calculating the 3D structure of a protein given its amino acid sequence has been a fundamental problem in biology for half a century. Deep learning has significantly impacted this area by providing a way to predict the 3D structure accurately.
