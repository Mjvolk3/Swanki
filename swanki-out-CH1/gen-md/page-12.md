### Card 1
## Define the sum-of-squares error function mentioned in the paper and its significance.

% 
The sum-of-squares error function is defined mathematically as:

$$
E(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( y(x_n, \mathbf{w}) - t_n \right)^2
$$

where:
- $E(\mathbf{w})$ is the error function.
- $y(x_n, \mathbf{w})$ is the model's prediction for data point $x_n$.
- $t_n$ is the actual target value for $x_n$.
- $\mathbf{w}$ represents the vector of model parameters.

This function is significant because it quantifies the discrepancy between the model's predictions and the actual data points. Minimizing this error function during training helps the model fit the training data accurately.

### Card 2
## How does regularization help in controlling the overfitting phenomenon in machine learning models?

%
Regularization helps control the overfitting phenomenon by adding a penalty term to the error function. This penalty term discourages the coefficients from having large magnitudes and helps in smoothing the model.

The regularized error function is typically given by:

$$
E_{\text{reg}}(\mathbf{w}) = E(\mathbf{w}) + \lambda R(\mathbf{w})
$$

where:
- $E_{\text{reg}}(\mathbf{w})$ is the regularized error function.
- $E(\mathbf{w})$ is the original error function.
- $R(\mathbf{w})$ is the penalty term.
- $\lambda$ is a regularization parameter that balances the trade-off between fitting the data and keeping the coefficients small.

By appropriately choosing $\lambda$, the model complexity can be controlled even for large numbers of parameters, thereby reducing overfitting.

### Card 3
## What is the heuristic mentioned for choosing the number of data points relative to the number of learnable parameters in a model?

% 
A rough heuristic suggested in the paper for choosing the number of data points relative to the number of learnable parameters in a model is that the number of data points $N$ should be no less than some multiple (say 5 or 10) of the number of learnable parameters $P$ in the model:

$$
N \geq kP
$$

where $k$ is typically 5 or 10. 

This heuristic helps ensure that the model has enough data to generalize well and avoids overfitting to the training data. However, this heuristic might not always hold true, especially in modern deep learning contexts where models often have more parameters than training data points but still perform well.

### Card 4
## Discuss the impact of increasing the size of the data set on the overfitting problem, as illustrated in Figure 1.8.

%
Figure 1.8 shows that increasing the size of the data set reduces the overfitting problem. The left plot with $N=15$ data points for an $M=9$ polynomial has significant overfitting, while the right plot with $N=100$ data points for the same polynomial shows much less overfitting.

Increasing the data size allows for the fitting of a more complex (i.e., more flexible) model. This happens because more data provides more information, leading to better generalization and reducing the likelihood of fitting noise in the data.

### Card 5
## Explain why limiting the number of parameters according to the size of the training set is considered unsatisfying, and what alternative approach is suggested.

%
Limiting the number of parameters according to the size of the training set is considered unsatisfying because it does not take into account the complexity of the problem being solved. Instead, it restricts the model based purely on the data available, which might not always be ideal for capturing the underlying data distribution.

The alternative approach suggested is regularization, which adds a penalty term to the error function to control the magnitude of the model's coefficients, thereby preventing overfitting:

$$
E_{\text{reg}}(\mathbf{w}) = E(\mathbf{w}) + \lambda R(\mathbf{w})
$$

By using regularization, the complexity of the model can be chosen independently of the size of the training set, focusing instead on the complexity of the problem.
