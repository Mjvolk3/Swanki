ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a plot of a synthetic data set used for illustrative purposes in machine learning. On the horizontal axis labeled "x," we see values ranging from 0 to 1. On the vertical axis labeled "t," we see values ranging from approximately -1 to 1. There are 10 blue points plotted on the graph, each corresponding to a pair of values (x, t). These represent the data points in the synthetic data set.

Additionally, there is a smooth green curve passing through the data points. This curve represents the function \(\sin(2\pi x)\), which was used to generate the target variable 't' for each observation of the input variable 'x'. The goal mentioned in the contextual information is to predict the value of 't' for new values of 'x', based on this training data set, without having explicit knowledge of the green sinusoidal curve that was used to generate the data.

The exercise demonstrates concepts in machine learning such as supervised learning, generalization, and fitting a model to the data to enable predictions.
