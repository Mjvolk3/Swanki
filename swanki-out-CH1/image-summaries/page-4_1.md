ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows the three-dimensional structure of a protein. The green structure represents the actual 3D conformation as determined by X-ray crystallography, which is considered the "ground truth" for the protein's shape. Superimposed on it in blue is the predicted structure as generated by a deep learning model, likely AlphaFold, as mentioned in the provided context. The close alignment of the two structures suggests that the deep learning model is very accurate in predicting the protein's 3D structure from its amino acid sequence.
