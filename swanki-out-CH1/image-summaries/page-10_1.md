ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided is a set of four plots showing polynomial curve fitting to data points for a one-dimensional regression problem. Each plot represents a polynomial of a different order, labeled with \(M\), where \(M\) denotes the order of the polynomial. The blue points are the given data points and the red curve represents the fitted polynomial. Each plot is a visualization of how polynomials of various orders fit the data points:

- Top-left \(M=0\): This plot shows a horizontal line since a polynomial of order \(M=0\) is just a constant.
- Top-right \(M=1\): This plot shows a straight line that is fitted through the data, representing a polynomial of first order.
- Bottom-left \(M=3\): This plot includes a cubic polynomial, which fits the data more closely than the \(M=0\) and \(M=1\) models.
- Bottom-right \(M=9\): Here, there is a ninth-order polynomial that fits all the data points exactly, but oscillates wildly, which is an indication of overfitting.

The context provided in the text discusses the problem of overfitting in machine learning and illustrates it with this figure by showing a well-fitting polynomial for \(M=3\) and an overfit polynomial for \(M=9\). Overfitting happens when a model is too complex and starts to capture the noise in the data rather than just the underlying relationship.

This figure complements the text's explanation of how different complexities of model (i.e., different values of \(M\)) can affect the prediction error on both training and test data sets. It visually demonstrates the concept of overfitting that occurs when a model is too complex (such as with \(M=9\)) and captures the noise in the training data, failing to generalize well to new, unseen data.
