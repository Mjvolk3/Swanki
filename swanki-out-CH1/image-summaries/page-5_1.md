ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image displays a grid containing eight portraits of individuals' faces. The grid is arranged in two rows, with four images each, showing a diverse variety of facial characteristics, hairstyles, and expressions. These faces appear to be created using a deep neural network and represent artificial, synthetic human images. The technology behind their creation involves generative models, which, after being trained on numerous real photographs, can produce highly realistic yet nonexistent human likenesses. These models are commonly used as examples of unsupervised learning in the field of artificial intelligence.
