ChatGPT figure/image summary: The provided images appear to be figures and tables from an academic paper or textbook related to machine learning or statistical modeling. Here's what each image represents:

1. The first image shows a plot of polynomials of various orders \(M\) fitted to a data set. These polynomial functions are depicted as red curves, likely plotted over data points, illustrating how they fit the given dataset with increased complexity as \(M\) increases.

2. The second image is the same as the first and shows one of the polynomial fits in greater detail.

3. The third image is also the same as the first and second, showing another polynomial fit to the data set in greater detail.

4. The fourth image is again the same as those above, highlighting one of the polynomial fits which is likely to represent overfitting due to its oscillatory behavior.

5. The fifth image also falls in line with the previous images, likely illustrating the same concept from a different angle or focus, perhaps zooming in on a different section of the polynomialâ€™s behavior.

6. The sixth image is a graph of the root-mean-square (RMS) error for both a training set and a test set plotted against various values of \(M\). This shows how the error changes with the complexity of the polynomial model, indicating overfitting when \(M\) is too large and underfitting when \(M\) is too small.

7. The final image (Figure 1.8) presents plots of solutions using an \(M=9\) polynomial fitted to datasets of different sizes: \(N=15\) data points in the left plot and \(N=100\) data points in the right plot. These plots demonstrate how increasing the dataset's size can mitigate the overfitting problem. 

All these images relate to the understanding and demonstration of overfitting in predictive modeling, emphasizing the importance of balancing model complexity with the ability to generalize to new data.
