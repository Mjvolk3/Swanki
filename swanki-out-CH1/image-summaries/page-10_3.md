ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a graphical representation of a polynomial curve fitting exercise. The graph shows a red curve which represents a polynomial of order \( M = 3 \) fitted to a dataset illustrated by blue data points. The fitting has been done by minimizing some error function. The vertical axis is labeled "t" and the horizontal axis as "x," and the range for both axes is from 0 to 1. The blue data points appear to come from a function with a sinusoidal pattern, and the red curve attempts to capture the trend of these data points, resulting in delivering an approximation of the underlying function that generated the data.
