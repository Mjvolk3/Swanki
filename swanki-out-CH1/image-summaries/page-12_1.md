ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image you provided displays two plots illustrating the results of fitting a ninth-order polynomial to two different datasets, one with 15 data points (left plot) and one with 100 data points (right plot). On both plots, the blue dots represent the data points, and there are two curves shown â€“ presumably the green one represents the true underlying function \( \sin(2\pi x) \), and the red curve represents the fitted $M=9$ polynomial curve resulting from minimizing the sum-of-squares error function.

The left plot demonstrates overfitting for the smaller dataset with N=15, where the red curve passes through or very close to all the data points, causing it to exhibit large oscillations that do not reflect the true underlying green sine wave pattern well.

In contrast, the right plot shows that when the dataset is larger with N=100, the overfitting problem is mitigated, and the red polynomial curve provides a better approximation of the green sine wave, smoothly capturing the general trend of the data with less overfitting to the individual points.

These plots are used to illustrate the concept that increasing the size of the training dataset can help reduce the problem of overfitting, even when using a complex model with many parameters.
