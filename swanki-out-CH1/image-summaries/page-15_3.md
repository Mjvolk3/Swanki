ChatGPT figure/image summary: It appears that there has been a mistake in providing the relevant context for the image. You've given a detailed context about the importance of selecting hyperparameters in machine learning, including regularization parameters (like \(\lambda\)) and model complexity (like the polynomial order \(M\)), and you've discussed how validation sets, cross-validation, and specifically \(S\)-fold cross-validation can be used to assess model performance without overfitting.

However, the image provided at the end—a simple 4-block structure with one block filled in red—looks like a visual representation of one run in an \(S\)-fold cross-validation process. This illustration seems to correspond to the description of \(S\)-fold cross-validation from the text, where the red block represents the portion of the data held out for validation during that specific run. Since the context refers to run 3, this illustration likely depicts the third iteration of the cross-validation process, with the data being divided into 4 parts and the third part being used for validation.

The originally requested Figure 1.10, which should depict a graph of the root-mean-square error versus \(\ln \lambda\) for the \(M=9\) polynomial, is not present here. Without the specific image of that graph, I can't comment on its content. If you can provide the correct image for Figure 1.10, I would be able to help describe it.
