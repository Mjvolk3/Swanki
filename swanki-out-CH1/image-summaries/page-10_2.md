ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a plot of a polynomial fitted to a set of data points. The polynomial has an order of M=0, shown as a red horizontal line, indicating a constant function. The data points are represented by blue dots on a graph that plots the variable 't' on the vertical axis against 'x' on the horizontal axis. The green curve represents the actual function from which the data points were generated, which, based on the context, seems to be the sine function sin(2Ï€x). The horizontal line indicates that the model is not fitting the actual trend in the data well, as it does not capture any of the variations that the sine function exhibits.
