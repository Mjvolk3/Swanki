ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image contains two plots side by side. Both graphs depict curves that represent polynomial fits to a set of data points which are shown as blue dots.

On the left plot, we see a curve (possibly in red) closely following the trajectory of the blue data points, along with another smoother curve (possibly in green) that looks like a generalized fit to the data. The plot is labeled with "ln λ = -18", indicating that this is the curve resulting from fitting the M=9 polynomial to the data using a regularized error function with the natural logarithm of the regularization parameter λ being -18.

On the right plot, we similarly see the blue data points and two curves. However, the fit here seems less optimal, with the curve (possibly in red) showing relatively large deviations from the data points when compared to the left plot. This plot is labeled with "ln λ = 0", suggesting that it corresponds to a regularized fit with a different value of the regularization parameter λ.

The context suggests that these plots are used to illustrate the effects of regularization on polynomial fitting with the aim of controlling the overfitting phenomenon. The left plot with "ln λ = -18" displays a better fit, indicating that this level of regularization helps to suppress overfitting. In contrast, the right plot with "ln λ = 0" indicates a poorer fit, suggesting that excessive regularization can lead to underfitting.
