ChatGPT figure/image summary: I'm sorry, but there is no image of Figure 1.10 in the content you've provided. You have included textual content that mentions a graph of the root-mean-square error versus the natural logarithm of the hyperparameter lambda for an M=9 polynomial, which is expected to be in Figure 1.10. However, you havenâ€™t shared the actual image of that figure. If you would like me to analyze the mentioned figure, please provide the appropriate image.
