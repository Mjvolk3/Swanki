ChatGPT figure/image summary: The given image is a simplified schematic representation of a feed-forward neural network. It shows three levels or layers of units: inputs on the left, hidden units in the middle, and outputs on the right. Each input unit is connected to every hidden unit, indicating that the value of each input node is transmitted to all of the hidden units. Similarly, each hidden unit is connected to every output unit, representing how the processed information from the hidden layer is passed on to the output layer. The arrows symbolize the direction of data flow through the network: from the input units through the hidden units and finally to the output units. This kind of network architecture is commonly used in machine learning to model complex functions and make predictions or decisions based on input data.
