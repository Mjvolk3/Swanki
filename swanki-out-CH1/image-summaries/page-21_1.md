ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a plot illustrating the number of compute cycles required to train state-of-the-art neural network models over time, from around the 1960s to the present. The vertical axis represents the number of petaflop/s-days on a logarithmic scale, indicating the computational cost of training, while the horizontal axis represents time by year.

The plot has several labeled points that correspond to significant milestones in the development of neural network models, such as the Perceptron, LeNet-5, AlexNet, and more recent advances like AlphaGo Zero. Notably, there are two lines indicating periods of exponential growth in computational requirements: one with a doubling time of approximately two years, consistent with Moore's Law, and the more recent deep learning era showing a much steeper growth with a doubling time of 3.4 months.

Key models and milestones in machine learning and neural network development are highlighted on the plot, and two distinct epochs in the growth of computational need are visible, separated into a "First Era" and "Modern Era." The Modern Era showcases a rapid increase in computation demand for training deep neural networks, reflecting the advances and scaling described in the provided text.
