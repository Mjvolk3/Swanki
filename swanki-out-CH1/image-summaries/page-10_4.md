ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided is a two-dimensional plot with the x-axis labeled as "x" and the y-axis labeled as "t". It depicts a scatter plot of blue data points along with two curves. One curve is a red curve that represents a polynomial of order M = 1 fitted to the data points. The other curve appears to be a green curve that represents the true function from which the data points were likely generated or it could be a fit for a different model. This kind of visualization is typically used in machine learning to illustrate the fit of a model to data and to discuss concepts such as overfitting or underfitting, as mentioned in the provided contextual information.
