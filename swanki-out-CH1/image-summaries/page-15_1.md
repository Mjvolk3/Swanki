ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image appears to represent a segment of Figure 1.11 referenced in the text, showing an illustration of the technique of S-fold cross-validation, particularly for the case of S=4. It should depict the data partitioning process in which the available dataset is divided into four groups of equal size. The colored (likely red) section represents the 'held-out' group, which is not used in the training set for a specific run and is instead used for validation. The rest of the segments (white or uncolored) are used for training the model. This procedure is repeated for all S possible combinations to ensure every group is used for validation once.

However, since the image provided is small and only shows a part of one of the runs, without additional context it is difficult to determine more detail. The image likely corresponds to one of the four runs mentioned in the text, where the different runs have one of the four segments colored to represent the validation set for that particular run.
