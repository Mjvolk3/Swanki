ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image contains a plot of a high-degree polynomial function fitted to a set of data points. The data points are shown as blue dots, and the polynomial function is depicted as a red curve. This plot illustrates the concept of overfitting in machine learning, where the fitted polynomial curve (of order M=9) passes through every data point, resulting in a model that is too complex for the underlying pattern it tries to capture, causing it to oscillate wildly between the points. The green curve represents the original function that generated the data, which is likely to be a sinusoid given the context (specifically, \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) as mentioned in the text). The x-axis represents the independent variable x, and the y-axis represents the target variable, marked as 't'. This example demonstrates how a more complex model does not necessarily yield a better prediction for new data points and can result in poor generalization.
