What is the main drawback of the red curve depicted in the provided plot?

% 

The main drawback of the red curve, which fits the polynomial of order $M$, is that it overfits the data. Although it passes exactly through each data point (yielding $E\left(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\right)=0$), it oscillates wildly and does not provide a good representation of the underlying function $\sin (2 \pi x)$, thus failing to generalize well to new, unseen data.

What does the green curve likely represent in the given plot, and why is it significant?

%

The green curve likely represents the true function from which the data points were generated, or a fit from a different, possibly simpler model that captures the underlying trend better. This is significant because it illustrates the problem of overfitting versus underfitting: while the red curve fits the training data too closely (overfitting), a simpler model like the one represented by the green curve can provide a better generalization to new data.
