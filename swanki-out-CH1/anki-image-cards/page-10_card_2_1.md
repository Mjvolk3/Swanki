The red curve in the plot represents a constant function, which is a polynomial of order $M=0$. It approximates the data set by minimizing the error function (1.2). However, it fails to capture the characteristics of the underlying sine function $\sin(2\pi x)$, indicating under-fitting.

### What is the behavior called when a fitted polynomial gives a poor representation of the underlying function by oscillating wildly?

This behavior is known as over-fitting. It occurs when a fitted polynomial, despite passing exactly through each data point (resulting in an error $E\left(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\right)=0$), oscillates wildly and does not represent the true underlying function, such as $\sin(2\pi x)$ in this context.
