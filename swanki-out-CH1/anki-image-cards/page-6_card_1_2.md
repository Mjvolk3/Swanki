## How is the training data set described in the plot generated and what is the goal of using this dataset in machine learning?

The training data set consists of $N=10$ points, each comprising an observation of the input variable $x$ and the corresponding target variable $t$, represented as blue circles. The green curve shows the function $\sin(2\pi x)$ used to generate the target values. The goal is to predict the value of $t$ for new values of $x$ without knowledge of the underlying green curve.

## What is the function used to generate the target variable 't' in the plot, and how is this function represented in the image?

The function used to generate the target variable $t$ is $\sin(2\pi x)$. This function is represented by the smooth green curve passing through the blue data points in the image.
