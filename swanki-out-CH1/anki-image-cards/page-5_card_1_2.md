The synthetic face images shown in the figure were generated by a deep neural network trained using unsupervised learning. These images illustrate the capability of generative models to create highly realistic, yet artificially produced, human faces after being trained on numerous real photographs. Such models are a key example of how unsupervised learning is utilized in artificial intelligence.

A large language model (LLM) is a powerful model used for processing natural language and other sequential data. It employs deep learning to build rich internal representations that capture the semantic properties of language. An important class of LLMs is called autoregressive language models, which can generate language as output, thereby functioning as a form of generative AI.
