The 20x20 array of cadmium sulphide photocells was used to convert illuminated images, such as printed characters, into a primitive 400-pixel digital format by focusing the scene onto this array. Each photocell detected light, enabling the perceptron to process visual data from the camera system.

Different configurations of input features were tested using a patch board shown in the middle photograph. This board allowed for various wiring setups of the input features, which were often configured randomly to illustrate the perceptron's capability to learn without precise wiring requirements.
