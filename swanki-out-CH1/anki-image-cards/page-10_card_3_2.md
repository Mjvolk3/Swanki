Figure 1.6 shows polynomial curves of various orders \(M\) as red curves fitted to a dataset by minimizing the error function \(E(\mathbf{w}^{\star}) = 0\). The figure demonstrates that while a higher-order polynomial may pass exactly through each data point, this can lead to over-fitting, where the fitted curve oscillates excessively and fails to represent the underlying function \(\sin(2\pi x)\) effectively.

## What problem is illustrated by the polynomial fit in Figure 1.6, and why does it occur?

The polynomial fit in Figure 1.6 illustrates the problem of over-fitting. Over-fitting occurs when a model fits the training data too closely, passing through all data points and minimizing the error function \(E(\mathbf{w}^{\star}) = 0\). This leads to a model that captures noise in the data, resulting in significant oscillations and an inaccurate representation of the true underlying function, in this case, \(\sin(2\pi x)\).
