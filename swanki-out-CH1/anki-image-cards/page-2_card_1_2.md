Deep learning can aid in diagnosing skin cancer by analyzing large datasets of skin lesion images. By training on these datasets, deep learning models can learn to distinguish between malignant melanomas and benign nevi with high accuracy. This approach leverages the model's ability to identify subtle differences in patterns that may be difficult for the untrained eye, thereby improving diagnostic precision and potentially aiding medical professionals in early detection and treatment.

### Card 2

#### What types of skin lesions are displayed in the given image and why is it challenging to distinguish between them?

The image displays two types of skin lesions: malignant melanomas (top row) and benign nevi (bottom row). It is challenging to distinguish between them because both types of lesions can appear visually similar, making it difficult for even trained professionals to diagnose using visual inspection alone. This highlights the necessity of advanced methods, such as deep learning, to improve diagnostic accuracy through analysis of subtle differences in large datasets.
