What does overfitting signify about the fitted curve in relation to the function $\sin (2 \pi x)$ shown in the image provided?

%

Overfitting signifies that although the polynomial curve of order $M$ passes exactly through each data point (yielding a zero error $E\left(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\right) = 0$), it fails to generalize well and oscillates wildly, providing a poor representation of the true function $\sin (2 \pi x)$.

Why does a polynomial curve of high order $M$ that minimizes the error function not necessarily provide a good representation of the underlying function?

%

A polynomial curve of high order $M$, while minimizing the error function and passing through every data point, tends to overfit the data. This results in excessive oscillations and does not generalize well to the underlying function $\sin (2 \pi x)$, leading to poor prediction performance on new data.
