The technique of $S$-fold cross-validation involves splitting the data into $S$ equally sized groups. In each of the $S$ runs, one group is used as a validation set (red block), while the remaining $S-1$ groups are used for training. This process is repeated until each group has been used as the validation set exactly once. The performance scores from each run are then averaged to estimate the modelâ€™s overall performance.

## In $S$-fold cross-validation, what is the proportion of the data used for training and validation when $S=4$?

When $S=4$, each fold will use $\frac{S-1}{S} = \frac{4-1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} = 75\%$ of the data for training and $\frac{1}{S} = \frac{1}{4} = 25\%$ of the data for validation.
