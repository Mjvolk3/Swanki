The plots in Figure 1.8 illustrate that increasing the size of the dataset reduces the problem of overfitting. The left plot with $N=15$ data points shows significant overfitting, where the $M=9$ polynomial curve (red) exhibits large oscillations, attempting to pass through every data point. Conversely, the right plot with $N=100$ data points demonstrates that the overfitting problem is mitigated, with the polynomial curve more accurately following the general trend of the data.
