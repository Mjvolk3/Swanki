The main components of neurons are:
1. The cell body (soma), which contains the nucleus.
2. Dendrites, which are branching structures that receive electrical signals from other neurons.
3. Axon, a long projection that transmits signals to other neurons.
4. Synapses, the junctions where the axon terminal of one neuron communicates with the dendrite or cell body of another neuron, usually via chemical neurotransmitters.

Synapses are the junctures where the axon terminal of one neuron communicates with the dendrite or cell body of another neuron. This communication typically occurs via chemical neurotransmitters. Synapses play a crucial role in neural communication and are essential for the functioning of neural networks in the brain. They enable learning, memory, and information processing by allowing the transmission of electrical signals between neurons.
