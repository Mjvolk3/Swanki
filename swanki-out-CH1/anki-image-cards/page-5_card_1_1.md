The image in Figure 1.3 showcases synthetic face images generated by a deep neural network trained using unsupervised learning. These faces do not belong to real individuals but are artificially created by the generative model based on training data consisting of many real photographs.

A large language model (LLM) is a powerful model used in machine learning to process natural language and other sequential data such as source code. It utilizes deep learning to form rich internal representations capturing the semantic properties of language. Autoregressive language models, a subset of LLMs, can generate language as output, making them a form of generative AI.
