The patch board allowed for different configurations of input features to be tested. Often, these configurations were wired randomly to demonstrate the perceptron's ability to learn without the need for precise wiring, which is in contrast to modern digital computers that rely on precise configurations.

## What was the primitive image resolution obtained by the Mark 1 perceptron's simple camera system? Describe how this is achieved.

The primitive image resolution obtained by the Mark 1 perceptron's camera system was $20 \times 20$ pixels, creating a 400-pixel image. This was achieved by focusing an illuminated input scene onto a $20 \times 20$ array of cadmium sulphide photocells.
