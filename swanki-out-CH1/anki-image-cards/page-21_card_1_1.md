What does Figure 1.16 illustrate regarding the computational requirements for training state-of-the-art neural networks over time?

Figure 1.16 illustrates how the number of compute cycles needed to train state-of-the-art neural networks has grown dramatically over the years. The plot shows two distinct phases of exponential growth. The vertical axis, measured in petaflop/s-days (a petaflop represents $10^{15}$ floating point operations), highlights the exponential increase in computational cost, while the horizontal axis represents the timeline starting from the 1960s to the present. Key models and milestones in the development of neural networks, like the Perceptron, LeNet-5, AlexNet, and AlphaGo Zero, are labeled, indicating significant technological breakthroughs. The graph reveals two exponential growth rates: Moore's Law phase with a doubling time of approximately two years and a more recent deep learning era with a steeper growth rate and a doubling time of 3.4 months.

Describe the two distinct eras of exponential growth shown in the plot and how they differ in terms of computational requirements.

The plot showcases two distinct phases of exponential growth.

1. The "First Era" aligns with Moore's Law, exhibiting a doubling in computational requirements about every two years.
2. The "Modern Era" of deep learning shows a much steeper exponential growth with a doubling time of approximately 3.4 months.

This rapid increase highlights the accelerating demand for computational power to train modern deep neural networks, significantly surpassing the earlier growth rate.
