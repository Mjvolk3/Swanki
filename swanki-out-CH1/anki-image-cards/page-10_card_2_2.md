What is illustrated by the red horizontal line in the provided polynomial plot?

%

The red horizontal line represents a polynomial of order $M=0$, which is a constant function. It indicates underfitting because it does not capture any variations in the data points or the actual function $\sin(2\pi x)$. This results in a poor representation of the underlying trend.

## Concept of Overfitting

What does overfitting imply in the context of polynomial regression?

%

Overfitting, as illustrated by a high-order polynomial that passes exactly through each data point ($E(\mathbf{w}^{\star})=0$), results in exaggerated oscillations and a poor general representation of the true function $\sin(2\pi x)$. The model captures noise in the data rather than the actual underlying trend.
