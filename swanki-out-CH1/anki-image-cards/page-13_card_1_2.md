What does the left plot with $\ln \lambda = -18$ in Figure 1.9 illustrate in the context of polynomial fitting?

%

The left plot with $\ln \lambda = -18$ illustrates a better fit to the data points, indicating that this level of regularization helps to suppress overfitting. The regularization parameter $\lambda$ is small, but not zero, allowing the polynomial to follow the data points closely while mitigating overfitting.

## Effects of Regularization on Polynomial Fitting

Explain the difference observed in the polynomial fits between the plots labeled $\ln \lambda = -18$ and $\ln \lambda = 0$.

%

The difference between the plots is due to the level of regularization applied. The plot with $\ln \lambda = -18$ shows a better fit to the data points, suggesting an optimal level of regularization that controls overfitting. In contrast, the plot with $\ln \lambda = 0$ shows a less optimal fit, suggesting underfitting due to the chosen $\lambda$ being too large, reducing the complexity of the polynomial and thus its ability to fit the data accurately.
