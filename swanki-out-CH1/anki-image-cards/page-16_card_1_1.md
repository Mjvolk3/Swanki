The main components of a neuron include:
- **Cell body**: Contains the nucleus and is central to the neuron's activities.
- **Dendrites**: Branching structures that receive electrical signals from other neurons.
- **Axon**: A long projection that transmits signals to other neurons.
- **Synapses**: Junctions where the axon terminal of one neuron communicates with the dendrite or cell body of another neuron.

Neurons communicate with each other through junctions called synapses. The axon terminal of one neuron releases chemical neurotransmitters into the synapse, which are then received by the dendrites or cell body of another neuron. This process of chemical neurotransmitter release and reception facilitates the transmission of electrical signals, thus enabling inter-neuronal communication and is crucial for learning, memory, and information processing.
