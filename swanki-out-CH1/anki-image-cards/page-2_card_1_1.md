What are the main differences between malignant melanomas and benign nevi in skin lesions, and why is it challenging to distinguish between them visually?

%

Malignant melanomas are dangerous forms of skin cancer that can be cured if detected and treated early, while benign nevi are harmless. However, these two types of lesions appear very similar, making it difficult for the untrained eye to distinguish between them through visual inspection alone. This challenge underscores the importance of using machine learning approaches, such as deep learning, for accurate medical diagnosis.

How has deep learning contributed to the diagnosis of skin cancer, and what is the significance of Figure 1.1 in this context?

%

Deep learning has been used to address the problem of accurately diagnosing skin cancer by training models on large datasets of lesion images. Figure 1.1 exemplifies this application by showing skin lesions categorized into malignant melanomas and benign nevi. The difficulty in visually distinguishing between these lesions highlights the need for machine learning models to assist in medical diagnosis, ensuring more reliable detection and treatment of skin cancer.
