Figure 1.15 is a schematic of a feed-forward neural network with three layers: input, hidden, and output. Each input unit is connected to every hidden unit, transmitting data to all hidden nodes. Similarly, each hidden unit connects to every output unit, showing that processed information flows from the hidden layer to the output layer. The arrows indicate the direction of data flow: from input units, through hidden units, and finally to the output units. This network architecture is commonly used for modeling complex functions in machine learning.

## What is the significance of differentiability in activation functions for neural networks?

The differentiability of the activation function $f(\cdot)$ is crucial because it allows the computation of derivatives of the error function with respect to the network's parameters. This is essential for optimization algorithms like gradient descent, enabling the training process to minimize errors by adjusting weights across multiple layers in the network.
