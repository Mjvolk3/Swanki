The goal is to predict the value of the target variable $t$ for new values of the input variable $x$, based on the training data set of 10 points, without having explicit knowledge of the green curve $\sin(2\pi x)$ used to generate the data.

## What does the green curve in the image represent, and how does it relate to the blue data points?

The green curve represents the function $\sin(2\pi x)$, which was used to generate the target variable 't' for each observed value of the input variable 'x'. The blue points are the actual data points $(x, t)$ in the training set, which were generated using this sinusoidal function.
