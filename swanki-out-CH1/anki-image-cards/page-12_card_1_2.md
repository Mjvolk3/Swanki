Figure 1.8 illustrates the solutions obtained by minimizing the sum-of-squares error function using an $M=9$ polynomial for two datasets of different sizes ($N=15$ on the left and $N=100$ on the right). The figure shows that increasing the size of the dataset reduces the overfitting problem, as the larger dataset (right plot) leads to a polynomial curve that better approximates the true underlying function and is less influenced by individual data points.

## How does the size of the dataset impact overfitting in polynomial regression based on Figure 1.8?

Increasing the size of the dataset reduces the overfitting problem in polynomial regression. The left plot with $N=15$ data points shows significant overfitting, where the $M=9$ polynomial curve exhibits large oscillations. In contrast, the right plot with $N=100$ data points demonstrates that the polynomial curve provides a smoother approximation of the true function, capturing the general trend with less overfitting.
