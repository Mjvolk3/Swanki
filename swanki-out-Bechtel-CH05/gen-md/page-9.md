## Describe Claude's centrifugation procedure for separating cell contents, including the specific conditions he used and the results he observed.

Claude's centrifugation procedure involved centrifuging whole liver cells from Amphiuma tridactylum for one hour at $18,000 \mathrm{~g}$. This caused the cell contents to separate into distinguishable layers while remaining within the cell membrane. By staining the cells with Bensley's stain (acid fuchsin-methyl green), Claude could vividly differentiate what he took to be secretory granules and mitochondria in red against a purple background. This resulted in four successive layers:

1. Glycogen
2. A combination of secretory granules and mitochondria that appeared red and also contained nuclei
3. The "purple substance" that he took to be microsomes
4. The true hyloplasm (cytosol)

## What was the primary criticism from Bensley's group regarding Claude's identification of secretory granules and mitochondria?

Bensley's group primarily criticized Claude's refusal to identify his large-granule fraction as essentially mitochondrial. They challenged his interpretation by arguing that the staining methods he used could differentiate between mitochondria and secretory granules. Hoerr specifically mentioned that Claude's methods of separation failed to produce pure preparations, instead yielding mixtures. Bensley's group preferred to refer to small particles as submicroscopic particulates rather than Claude's term microsomes.

## Explain Claude's additional finding in 1944 regarding the staining properties of the large granules extracted from guinea pig liver.

In 1944, Claude reported that the large granules extracted from guinea pig liver failed to stain with Janus green. Based on this observation, he concluded that liver may be a poor place to look for mitochondria. Subsequently, in a study on leukemic cells from rats, he contended that the large granule fraction consisted of true mitochondria.

## Describe the distinction Claude made between microsomes and hyloplasm based on his centrifugation and staining results.

Using his centrifugation and staining technique, Claude distinguished microsomes from hyloplasm in the following manner:

1. The "purple substance," which he took to be microsomes.
2. The true hyloplasm (cytosol), which appeared as a distinct layer.

This differentiation helped in understanding the finer substructures within cell contents and was based on their appearance and staining characteristics in the centrifuged layers.
