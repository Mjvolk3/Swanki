## How was the activity of cytochrome oxidase and succinoxidase distributed among different fractions?

Over three experiments, on average:

- $70 \%$ of cytochrome oxidase activity and $74 \%$ of succinoxidase activity was found in the large granule fraction.
- Less than $4 \%$ of cytochrome oxidase activity and $7 \%$ of succinoxidase activity was found in the microsome fraction.

The researchers attributed the minor activity in the microsome fraction to contamination by large granules or their fragments.

## What was the approach taken by the researchers after the war to interpret cell fractionation results?

After the war, the researchers adopted the "one enzyme-one fraction" approach. They aimed to link the activity of a given enzyme exclusively to one fraction, rather than determining the amount of enzyme activity in various fractions.

This shift marked the beginning of this approach in interpreting cell fractionation results.

## What were the key observations made by the researchers regarding the localization of cytochrome oxidase and succinoxidase?

The key observation made by the researchers was: "Taken together, these observations suggest that the cytochrome oxidase and succinoxidase systems... are entirely localized in the so-called large granules."

This conclusion was based on their findings of enzyme activity in different cell fractions.

## Why did Schneider and Palade join Claude's laboratory, and what were their backgrounds?

Schneider and Palade joined Claude's laboratory to continue investigations into the biochemistry of cell fractions. 

- Walter Schneider: Completed his Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin in 1945.
- George Palade: Native of Romania, studied medicine at the University of Bucharest, conducted physiological research on dolphin kidneys, taught anatomy during the war, and began working on cellular membranes with Robert Chambers before joining Claude's lab.
