## What medium did Hogeboom, Schneider, and Palade (1948) explore for cell fractionation, and what was one key observation?

Hogeboom, Schneider, and Palade (1948) explored sucrose as a medium for cell fractionation. They observed that with approximately isotonic $(0.25 \text{ M})$ sucrose, the large granules did not agglutinate and were roughly the same size as with isotonic saline. However, the particles did not retain the elongated shape of mitochondria.

## How did hypertonic sucrose solutions affect the particles observed by Hogeboom, Schneider, and Palade (1948)?

When Hogeboom, Schneider, and Palade (1948) used more hypertonic sucrose solutions, the particles became more elongated. The percentage of rod-like shapes reached a maximum with $0.8$ to $1.0 \text{ M}$ sucrose solutions. The researchers adopted $0.88 \text{ M}$ sucrose solutions for their research.

## What stain did the researchers use to identify mitochondria in their experiments, and how did they distinguish between mitochondrial and secretory granules?

The researchers used Janus green B, a stain selective for mitochondria, to identify these organelles. They distinguished between mitochondrial and secretory granules by noting that mitochondria stained with Janus green B, while secretory granules stained with neutral red and broke up after cell membrane rupture, migrating centripetally.

## What was one significant finding from Hogeboom and colleagues' improved fractionation procedures regarding the composition of mitochondria and microsome fractions?

One significant finding from Hogeboom and colleagues' improved fractionation procedures was that mitochondria contained nearly all the succinoxidase enzyme system. Additionally, they found that the microsome fraction contained about $50\%$ of the pentose nucleic acid.
