## What evidence did Porter provide to show that the endoplasm is the most active part of the living unit according to his observations in 1946-7?

Porter indicated that the endoplasm is “the most active part of the living unit,” as it is present in every explored cell form and constitutes the fibrillar apparatus surrounding the central body. He observed that the endoplasm generates fine extensions throughout the cell, suggesting a secretory role due to its vesicular structure, potentially determining the mosaic character of the egg cell.

## Describe the research method and findings of Porter and Helen Thompson (1947) concerning cultured cells from rat sarcomas.

In 1947, Porter and Helen Thompson examined cultured cells from three different rat sarcomas using electron microscopy. Their findings indicated a significantly greater density of endoplasmic granules located on shorter strands in these cancer cells. This observation helped in understanding the cellular structure and behavior of cancerous cells.

## Summarize Porter and Thompson's (1948) electron microscope study on mammary carcinoma in mice, including their hypothesis about the discovered particles.

In 1948, Porter and Thompson used an electron microscope to examine mammary gland tumor cells grown in tissue culture from mice. They discovered distinctive particles about $130 \text{ m} \mu$ in diameter with a dark, well-defined central core. Though the evidence was circumstantial, they hypothesized that these particles could be the viral agent present in the mother's milk, potentially transmitting the cancer.

## How did Claude's work in the 1940s contribute to the understanding of cell constitution through particle isolation and cell fractionation?

Claude's work in the 1940s focused on determining that normal cells contained particles similar in size to those isolated from tumor-causing fractions of Rous sarcoma cells. He increasingly concentrated on understanding the constitution of normal cells. His primary tool was cell fractionation, through which he developed standardized procedures to segregate cell components, thereby advancing the methodology for studying cellular structures and their functions.
