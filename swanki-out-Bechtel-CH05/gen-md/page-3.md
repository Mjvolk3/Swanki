## Describe the precipitation method employed by Claude in his attempt to purify the tumor-producing agent. Mention the result of this method.

Claude pursued several strategies to purify the tumor-producing agent. Among them was the precipitation of carbohydrates with gelatin followed by dialysis. This resulted in a twentyfold enrichment of the tumor-producing agent.

## Explain the use and outcome of high-speed centrifugation in Claude's research.

Claude utilized high-speed centrifugation after reading the reports of Ledingham and Gye (1935) and McIntosh (1935). He found that this method allowed him to isolate a more potent tumor-causing agent. In 1938, he reported isolating an agent with ten to fifty times greater potency than the original extract using this technique.

## What was the observation made by Claude when comparing granules under dark-field microscopy from centrifuged tumor cells and normal tissues?

Claude observed that both the tumor cell fraction and the fraction obtained from normal tissues, after centrifugation, consisted of small granules approximately $70 \mathrm{~nm}$ in diameter. Both had similar chemical compositions, notably containing phospholipids and ribonucleic acid.

## What inhibitory effect was identified through Claude's centrifugation study in Chicken Tumor 10 and how did he work around it?

In the 1937 Annual Report, Claude introduced centrifugation to address Chicken Tumor 10's transfer issues. He showed that the centrifuged particle could generate a tumor when combined with water, but not when combined with the supernatant from centrifugation. This suggested that the supernatant contained an inhibitor that prevented tumor development.
