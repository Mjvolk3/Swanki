## What did Porter, Claude, and Fullam observe about the mitochondria in their 1945 electron micrograph?

Porter, Claude, and Fullam noted that mitochondria appeared as elongated rod-like structures possessing areas of increased density and extremely small granules with diameters ranging from 10 to $20 \mu m$. They suggested that these granules could consist primarily of inorganic salts or represent centers where reduced osmium had accumulated.

## According to the authors, why did the dense bodies with angular outlines observed in electron micrographs appear like Golgi bodies?

The authors attributed the osmophilic character of the dense bodies with angular outlines in electron micrographs to Golgi bodies. They suggested that these dense structures might represent accumulations of osmium, giving them their unique appearance.

## What challenge did Porter, Claude, and Fullam make in their Annual Report for 1944-5 regarding the interpretation of the Golgi apparatus?

In their Annual Report for 1944-5, Porter, Claude, and Fullam challenged the prevailing interpretation of the Golgi apparatus as an artifact of the preparation process. Their observations from the 1945 electron micrograph provided evidence against this artifact hypothesis.

## What were the possible compositions proposed by the authors for the granules found in mitochondria?

The authors proposed two potential compositions for the granules found in mitochondria: they could either be composed primarily of inorganic salts or represent centers where reduced osmium had accumulated.
