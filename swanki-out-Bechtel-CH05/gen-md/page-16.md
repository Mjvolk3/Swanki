## What were some of the limitations of Caspersson's research impact in cell biology?

Despite his technical innovations, Caspersson's impact in the field of cell biology was limited because his focus remained on nucleic acids rather than the full range of cell activity.

## Which methods did Caspersson incorporate into his laboratory in 1946-7, and how did they impact his research focus?

Caspersson incorporated electron microscopy and cell fractionation into his laboratory in 1946-7. However, these techniques played a peripheral role as the laboratory remained focused primarily on cytochemistry.

## Why might Bensley, Brachet, and Caspersson have failed to create laboratories with the same research breadth as the Rockefeller Institute in cell biology?

Bensley, Brachet, and Caspersson's research projects emerged from existing recognized problems in subdomains of cell biology. Consequently, they did not develop laboratories with the same breadth of research as the Rockefeller Institute, which had a more comprehensive approach to cell biology.

## Describe the role of Keith Porter and George Hogeboom in the Rockefeller Laboratory expansion under Claude.

Keith Porter joined the Rockefeller Laboratory in 1939 and George Hogeboom in 1941. Porter is noted for contributions to cell structure research (to be discussed later), while Hogeboom brought expertise in cytochemistry and biochemistry, initially working closely with Murphy on cancer projects.
