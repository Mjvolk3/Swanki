## What methods did Bensley and Hoerr use to separate nuclei, blood corpuscles, and connective tissues from the supernatant and sediment mitochondria? Describe the separation technique and speed used.

Bensley and Hoerr used a two-step centrifugation process to separate cellular components:
1. First, they performed centrifugation at slow speeds to remove nuclei, blood corpuscles, and connective tissues.
2. Next, they centrifuged the remaining supernatant at higher speeds for longer periods to sediment the mitochondria.

## What was the observed average fat content by weight in mitochondrial particles according to Bensley and Hoerr's second paper?

Bensley and Hoerr's second paper showed that mitochondria comprised, on average, $43.6 \%$ fat by weight. The fat content analysis can be represented as:

$$
\text{Fat content in mitochondria} = 43.6\%

## What did Lazarow discover about the smaller particles during his quantitative analysis and how did he relate these findings to mitochondrial particles?

Lazarow discovered a smaller particle that appeared cherry red when separated by centrifugation. He showed that the smaller particle contained more phosphorus and fat than the mitochondrial particles. He also demonstrated that both the mitochondrial fraction and this smaller particle oxidized succinic acid, indicating the presence of enzymes such as succinic dehydrogenase, cytochrome $c$, and cytochrome oxidase. This implies both particles had enzymatic capabilities.

\text{Phosphorus and fat content comparison:}
\begin{cases}
\text{Mitochondrial particles} \\
\text{Smaller particles: More phosphorus and fat}
\end{cases}

## What hypothesis did Bensley and Hoerr propose regarding the structural protein "elipsin" in their previous paper, and how does it relate to the integrity of cell structure after removal of other components?

Bensley and Hoerr proposed the existence of a structural protein they named "elipsin." They argued that elipsin maintains the cell as a unit of organic structure after the removal of soluble globulins, mitochondria, and chromatin. This suggests that elipsin is fundamental to the microscopic structure and organic continuity of the cell body.

$$
\text{Elipsin: Maintains cell structure post-removal of}
\begin{cases}
\text{Soluble globulins} \\
\text{Mitochondria} \\
\text{Chromatin}
\end{cases}
