## How did the researchers measure the enzyme activity in their study after 1945?

The researchers used a Warburg manometer to measure the rate of oxygen uptake by providing a substrate (e.g., succinic acid salt) to the enzyme fraction.

%

After 1945, enzyme activity was measured by adding a substrate such as succinic acid salt to the enzyme fraction and using a Warburg manometer to measure the rate of oxygen uptake. This rate was indicative of the enzyme's presence and activity.

## In Table 5.1 of their 1943-1944 research, what was the observed activity of "Nuclease + Phosphatase" in the microsomes?

The activity observed was $+++{ }^{1}$ for "Nuclease + Phosphatase" in the microsomes.

%

Table 5.1 reports the activity of "Nuclease + Phosphatase" as $+++{ }^{1}$ in the microsomes, indicating a highly significant presence or activity in that fraction.

## What was the impact of war-related research on enzyme studies, as mentioned for the year 1944?

Research on enzyme studies, except for ribonuclease investigations, was suspended as Hogeboom was diverted to war-related research.

%

In 1944, all enzyme studies except ribonuclease investigations were suspended because Hogeboom was assigned to war-related research, highlighting the impact of external factors on scientific research priorities.

## What substrates did "Dehydrogenase" and "Cytochrome Oxidase" use based on Table 5.1?

"Dehydrogenase" used $\alpha$-glycerophosphate, while "Cytochrome Oxidase" used ascorbic acid as their substrates.

%

According to Table 5.1, "Dehydrogenase" utilized $\alpha$-glycerophosphate, and "Cytochrome Oxidase" utilized ascorbic acid as their respective substrates, demonstrating the specificity of enzyme-substrate interactions.
