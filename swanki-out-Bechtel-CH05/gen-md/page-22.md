## Describe the appearance of large particles from liver and mitochondria from leukemic cells under the electron microscope as reported by Claude in his Annual Report.

The large particles from liver and mitochondria from leukemic cells under the electron microscope appear as perfect opaque spheres 0.5 to $1.6 \mu$m in diameter. No definite membrane is evident in the prints. In instances where the granules are injured and some loss of substance has occurred, internal structure may be seen.

## What relationship did Claude suggest between large granules and microsomes?

Claude suggested that there is a relationship between large granules and microsomes because disrupted large granules in a test tube yield what appear to be microsomes. This observation, taken together with the internal structure seen in injured granules, supports this relationship.

## What inference did Claude make about the mitochondrial membrane and what was his evidence?

Claude inferred the presence of a mitochondrial membrane based on the behavior of mitochondria when some contents had escaped. He noted that the loss of substance seems to release the tension which keeps the mitochondrial body spherical, implying that mitochondria possess a differentiated covering.

## How did the use of sufficient salt in the media affect the mitochondria during fractionation as observed by Claude?

Claude observed that using sufficient salt in the media during fractionation retained the shape and discreteness of mitochondria. This suggested that the proper tonicity was critical to maintaining mitochondrial integrity, contrary to the assumption that mitochondria may be formed by the concretion of substances preexisting in the cytoplasm or that they might disappear and reappear in living cells due to changes in the surrounding protoplasm.
