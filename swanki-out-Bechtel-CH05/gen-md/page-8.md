## How did Claude's analysis unveil the chemical differences between the smaller and larger particles according to the paper?

Claude's analysis indicated that both smaller and larger particles contained phospholipids, although the smaller particles contained about twice the percentage. Additionally, both types of particles contained ribose nucleic acids, iron, and copper.

## Explain Claude's initial interpretation of the "large granule fraction" and how his view changed over time.

Initially, Claude thought the "large granule fraction" contained secretory particles, likely mitochondria. However, upon further investigation, he found the small particles to be a newly discovered cell constituent, different from mitochondria, and named them microsomes.

## According to the discussion by Schultz and collaborators, what role did RNA play in the synthesis of proteins?

Schultz, collaborating with Caspersson, proposed that RNA played a crucial role in protein synthesis.

## What was Claude's argument regarding the ergastoplasm and how did this contrast with the views of other researchers at the time?

Claude argued that the ergastoplasm did not exist and was merely an artefact produced by fixatives containing strong acids. He cited that well-preserved mitochondria and ergastoplasm were rarely found in the same preparation, suggesting the ergastoplasm was just poorly fixed mitochondria.
