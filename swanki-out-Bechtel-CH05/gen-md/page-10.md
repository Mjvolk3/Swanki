## What analytical technique did Brachet use to deduce that the red-stained nucleic acids in sea urchin eggs were RNA?

Brachet used ribonuclease treatment, which digests RNA, to deduce that the red-stained nucleic acids were RNA. When treated with ribonuclease, the red stain was removed, indicating the presence of RNA.

## Describe the correlation found by Jean Brachet between RNA and protein synthesis in growing oocytes?

Jean Brachet found that the amount of RNA was closely correlated with protein synthesis activity. He hypothesized that RNA played a role in protein synthesis, although the exact mechanism was unclear.

\text{The conclusion to which we are led is that the pentosenucleic acids [RNA] might intervene, by a mechanism as yet obscure, in the synthesis of proteins}

## Discuss the historical context of Brachet's study concerning the identification of thymonucleic acid and zymonucleic acid.

During the late 1920s, thymonucleic acid (DNA) was thought to occur only in animals, while zymonucleic acid (RNA) was primarily found in plants, although also recognized in the pancreas of animals. The differentiation of these nucleic acids was challenged by Brachet's discoveries regarding RNA's role in protein synthesis.

## What staining method allowed Brachet to attempt the localization of DNA in growing oocytes, and what was its result?

Brachet made use of the Feulgen reaction, which stains DNA green. This early histochemical method allowed him to differentiate between DNA and RNA, leading to his focus on RNA when observing that pyronine-stained substances in sea urchin eggs were RNA.
