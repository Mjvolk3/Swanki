## What did Peyton Rous discover at the Rockefeller Institute in 1909 that contributed to the field of cell biology?

Peyton Rous discovered that a tumor in a chicken could be transmitted from one animal to another by inoculation with either small portions of the tumor or a filtered extract that strained out all cancer cells. He concluded that the tumor was carried by "viral agents," which were infectious entities not bacterial in nature.

## Explain how the agent responsible for the Rous chicken sarcoma was characterized and its implications on the understanding of cancer.

Rous demonstrated that the agent responsible for the chicken sarcoma was present in a cell-free extract and could be transmitted even when tumor cells were killed with ultraviolet light, indicating it was not bacterial. This led to the understanding that the agent might be viral, contributing significantly to the study of cancer by suggesting that viral agents could induce tumors.

## What shift in research focus did James Murphy undergo after initially investigating cancer and lymphocytes?

Initially focusing on the possible role of lymphocytes in resisting cancer, James Murphy shifted his attention back to the agent responsible for the Rous chicken sarcoma. Murphy hypothesized that the agent might have an "enzyme-like nature," building on Rous' findings that indicated the agent was not bacterial and could withstand ultraviolet light destruction.

## Describe the process of lyophilization and its relevance to the research conducted by Murphy and Rous. 

Lyophilization, or freeze-drying, is the dehydration of a substance at low temperatures to preserve it. Murphy, while working under Rous, determined that this process could effectively preserve the agent responsible for the Rous chicken sarcoma, which further supported the notion that the agent was not bacterial and might be viral or enzyme-like in nature.
