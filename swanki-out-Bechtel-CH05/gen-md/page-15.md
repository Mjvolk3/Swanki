## What was the relationship between RNA presence and protein synthesis identified by Caspersson?

Caspersson found that the rapidity of protein synthesis in living bacteria is a simple, almost linear function of the amount of ribose nucleotides. He observed increased RNA levels in the interphase chromosome, nucleolus, and cytoplasm and correlated these increases with protein synthesis, although he remained vague about the exact role of RNA, still considering self-reproducing proteins as the genetic material.

## Summarize the general findings and limitations of Caspersson's work on protein synthesis.

Caspersson demonstrated that there is a nearly linear relationship between the amount of ribose nucleotides (RNA) and protein synthesis in bacteria. He noticed increased RNA levels in specific cell regions and hypothesized a correlation with protein synthesis. However, he was vague about the precise role of RNA, localizing protein synthesis in the nucleus without addressing RNA's specific role in the cytoplasm. Later evaluations criticized the accuracy and significance of his findings, acknowledging that the idea of RNA's correlation with protein synthesis was also noted by Brachet using simpler methods.

## Which aspects of protein synthesis did Caspersson fail to explain, according to later evaluations?

Caspersson failed to adequately explain the specific role of RNA in protein synthesis and the newly made proteins' role in the cytoplasm. While he correlated RNA presence with protein synthesis, his descriptions were vague and inaccurate upon later review. Evaluators noted that he had not produced substantial significant findings in more recent years.

## What did Caspersson conclude about viruses through his research?

Caspersson concluded that viruses take over the normal protein synthesis mechanisms of host cells. This conclusion was part of his broader investigations into protein synthesis and the interplay between nucleotides and proteins, where he studied changes in RNA levels and their correlation with protein synthesis.
