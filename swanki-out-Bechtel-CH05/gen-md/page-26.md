## Describe how Claude and Porter investigated tumor cells using electron microscopy, and summarize their conclusions.

Claude and Porter utilized electron microscopy to examine tumor cells. In their investigation, they discovered "small granules of uniform size" with density greater than the surrounding cytoplasm. Studies on Chicken Tumor 1 and Chicken Tumor 10 cells revealed granules of similar structure, which were distinguishable due to their regular granular shape, relatively uniform size, and greater density in osmium preparations. The distribution patterns in the two tumor types varied: Chicken Tumor 10 particles formed colonies, while Chicken Tumor 1 particles were more dispersed. By 1947, they concluded that these particles were likely causative agents of the respective tumors and speculated on their replication through division.

## What primary discovery did Porter make in relation to the endoplasm, and what technique facilitated this discovery?

Porter's primary discovery in relation to the endoplasm was its finely divided reticulum structure with tiny bodies scattered along its strands, observable in osmium-fixed preparations under the electron microscope. The particulate components were believed to be the same as microsomes isolated by high-speed centrifugation. The technique facilitating this discovery was thin sectioning of cells combined with electron microscopy.

## What was the significance of the size variation observed in particles according to Claude et al., and what hypothesis did they propose regarding this observation?

The size variation observed in particles suggested that the particles might grow in size before splitting and yield smaller particles post-split. Claude et al. hypothesized that this size variation was compatible with the particles replicating by division.
