## Why did Claude doubt the findings of both Caspersson and Brachet regarding the role of RNA in protein synthesis?

Claude doubted the findings of both Caspersson and Brachet regarding the role of RNA in protein synthesis because he questioned how protein synthesis could proceed once separated from the site of oxidative respiration.

Additionally, he speculated that RNA may be involved in anaerobic respiration "either in some phase of the anaerobic mechanism, or act as intermediate in the energy transfer for various synthetic reactions" (p. 163).

## In Claude's 1948 Harvey Lecture, how did he describe the mitochondria?

Claude described mitochondria as the locus of key oxidative processes and referred to them as "the real power plants of the cell," indicating their essential role in providing the bulk of the energy for cell functioning.

## What role did Claude speculate RNA plays in anaerobic respiration?

Claude speculated that RNA might be involved "either in some phase of the anaerobic mechanism, or act as intermediate in the energy transfer for various synthetic reactions" (p. 163).

The basis for his speculation was the correlation of both RNA and fermentation in yeast and some bacteria.

## What hypothesis did Claude propose about the distribution of metabolic activity and energy supply in the cell?

Claude hypothesized that "whereas most of the metabolic activity of the cell is found in the cytoplasm, the supply of energy may be segregated in various cytoplasmic entities: the aerobic respiration in the mitochondria, as already demonstrated, the anaerobic processes in the ground substance."

This might explain:
- The intense basophilia of cells in young embryos,
- Fast-growing tissues, and 
- Tumors, especially in areas where the circulation and the fresh supply of oxygen may be inadequate or defective.
