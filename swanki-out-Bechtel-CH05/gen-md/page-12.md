Brachet's research in the late 1940s and early 1950s significantly contributed to the development of molecular biology by exploring the roles of different forms of RNA in protein synthesis. He linked RNA and protein synthesis, connecting RNA to the particles that Claude labeled microsomes. Despite this, his work did not exert the same impact as the Rockefeller laboratory's contributions to cell biology.

## What may have limited the impact of Brachet's research compared to that of the Rockefeller laboratory?

Several factors likely limited the impact of Brachet's research compared to the Rockefeller laboratory:
1. Brachet and his collaborators focused solely on RNA and protein synthesis.
2. Electron microscopy was not central to their research.
3. They did not commit to differentiating distinct cell fractions representing different functions, unlike Claude's broader vision that shaped the Rockefeller laboratory's agenda in cell biology.

## What role did electron microscopy play in the research developments at Chantrenne's laboratory in the late 1950s?

In the late 1950s, new buildings were constructed for Chantrenne, which included an electron microscope purchased with funds from the Rockefeller Foundation. This advanced microscope was crucial for the developments in molecular biology and cell biology, although Brachet's team did not heavily employ electron microscopy in their research.

## How did Caspersson contribute to our understanding of the relationship between nucleic acids and proteins?

Caspersson, a student of Einar Hammarsten at the Karolinska Institute, made significant advancements in understanding the relationship between nucleic acids and proteins through spectrographic analysis. His work paralleled Brachet's in linking RNA and protein synthesis and was supported by substantial grants, including those from the Wallenberg and Rockefeller Foundations.
