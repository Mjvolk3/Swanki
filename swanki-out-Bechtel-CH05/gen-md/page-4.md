## What hypothesis did Claude initially consider and later find to be false regarding the granular particles he observed in cells?

Claude initially considered the hypothesis that the granular particles might be mitochondria. However, this hypothesis was later found to be false.

## Explain the evidence Claude used to support his initial hypothesis that the granular particles might be mitochondria.

Claude advanced several pieces of evidence to support his hypothesis:
1. The particles were of similar size and shape as mitochondria.
2. They had a similar composition of phospholipids and nucleoproteins.
3. They exhibited similar responses to heat and acids.
4. Janus green dye, which has a selective affinity for mitochondria, caused the isolated particles to show identical properties, turning purple with this dye.

## What major conceptual shift did Claude's research undergo after recognizing critical components in both normal and tumor cells?

Claude's research underwent a major conceptual shift from focusing on cancer cells to investigating the constituents of normal cells. This shift was characterized by a new conceptual framework where what had been the tumor agent became reinterpreted as a cytoplasmic particle, transforming the entire research system.

## Describe the importance of Janus green and methyl green dyes in Claude's research on granular particles and mitochondria.

Janus green and methyl green dyes played a crucial role in Claude's research by aiding in the identification of mitochondria. Janus green showed a selective affinity for mitochondria, turning the isolated particles purple under proper conditions. Methyl green made the cell nucleus brilliant green while mitochondria became purple, suggesting similar properties between the isolated particles and mitochondria.
