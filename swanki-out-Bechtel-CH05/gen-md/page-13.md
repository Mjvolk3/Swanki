## What innovation in spectroscopy did Caspersson develop under Hammarsten's supervision?

Caspersson developed methods for ultraviolet spectrography that combined a spectroscope and a microscope with a quartz lens, allowing estimation of nucleic acid content in different parts of living cells by relying on the strong absorption of light at 2600 \AA by pyrimidines in nucleic acids.

\text{Absorption wavelength of pyrimidines} = 2600 \text{ \AA}

## How did Caspersson's photoelectric apparatus for ultraviolet-microspectrography work?

Caspersson's photoelectric apparatus for ultraviolet-microspectrography relied on the following components and steps: the light passed through living cells, was concentrated in the microscope with an iris and a quartz-prism, and oriented using fluorescent glass and mirrors. Movements within the light-bundle facilitated the process.

## Describe the strategy Caspersson's institute used to balance instrument development and biological research, as per his 1953 report.

In his 1953 report, Caspersson described that his institute carefully divided its resources so that half were devoted to developmental work on instruments, and the other half to biological research focused on intracellular protein synthesis regulation. This balance was maintained even though a larger share in biological work would have made it financially easier.

$$
\text{Instrument Development} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{Total Resources}
$$

$$
\text{Biological Research} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{Total Resources}
$$

## How did World War II impact Caspersson's plans of working with the Rockefeller Foundation?

World War II delayed Caspersson's plans to be a Rockefeller Foundation fellow with Lewis. Initially, Jack Schultz's visit to Stockholm postponed the plans, but the outbreak of the war eventually prevented Caspersson's travel to the United States. Despite this, the Rockefeller Foundation continued supporting Caspersson with grants-in-aid throughout the war.
