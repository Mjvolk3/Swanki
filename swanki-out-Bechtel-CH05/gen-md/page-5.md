## In the early 20th century, Robert Bensley developed procedures to isolate mitochondria. What method did he use, and what were the main components of his staining technique?

% 

Robert Bensley utilized centrifugation to separate mitochondria from cells. He also developed cell staining techniques involving acetic-osmic-dichromate and anilin-acid fuchsin, methyl green, and copper-chrome-hematoxylin.

## Explain the significance of Bensley and Gersh's findings regarding the nature of mitochondria when using various solvents. 

%

Bensley and Gersh found that fat solvents like acetone had no effect on mitochondria, whereas water, $0.02 \%$ ammonia solution, and artificial gastric juice dissolved them. They concluded that "the main mass of the mitochondria substance is protein in nature" (p. 230).

## What procedural step did Bensley and Hoerr employ to prepare liver tissue before using centrifugation to isolate mitochondria?

%

Bensley and Hoerr prepared liver tissue by perfusing it with salt solution, then grinding it in a mincing machine and pushing it through cheesecloth.
