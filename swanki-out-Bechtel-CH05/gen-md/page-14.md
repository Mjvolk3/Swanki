## Explain how Caspersson utilized microscopy and photocells to measure substances in cell structures.

Caspersson used a system combining a microscope, prism, and photocell to measure substances in cell structures. By moving an enlarged picture (magnified 15,000 times) along perpendicular coordinates, he could focus on small areas within different cellular structures. Deviations in the filament-electrometer connected to the photocell, observed under a microscope, provided quantitative measurements of these areas.

## What was the significant contribution of Caspersson's work with ultraviolet illumination?

Caspersson discovered that nucleic acids and proteins had different absorption spectra under ultraviolet illumination. This allowed him to measure the local quantities of both in various cell structures and observe that nucleic acid levels peaked during cell division.

## How did Caspersson's view on the role of nucleic acids evolve?

Caspersson initially concluded that nucleic acids were not genetic material but were necessary for the reproduction and self-replication of proteins. He noted a probable connection between gene duplication and the presence of nucleic acids, indicating their role as prerequisites for the reproduction of genes and the multiplication of self-reproducing protein molecules.

## Summarize Caspersson's view on chromosomes and protein synthesis.

Caspersson correlated nucleic acids with protein synthesis, focusing on the self-replication of proteins in chromosomes during metaphase and linking it to DNA in the euchromatic region. He associated cytoplasmic proteins with the heterochromatic regions and emphasized the nucleolus's regulatory function in protein synthesis occurring in the nucleus outside the nucleolus. He concluded that polynucleotides are essential for protein synthesis, and the cell nucleus is central to protein production.
