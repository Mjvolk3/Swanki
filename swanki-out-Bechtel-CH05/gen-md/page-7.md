## How did Bensley contribute to the field of cytology? 

Bensley was referred to by Cowdry as "the acknowledged founder of the new cytology." He, along with his graduate students, made many advances in the field before Claude and the Rockefeller group received significant recognition in the field. One significant distinction in his work was his belief that mitochondria were not permanent structures but rather coacervates that appear and are reabsorbed into the protoplasm.

## What was a major difference in the interpretations of cell structures between Bensley and Claude?

Bensley and Claude had conflicting interpretations of the fractions derived from cell structures. While Claude initially identified smaller particles as mitochondria, Bensley and Hoerr had estimated that mitochondria were considerably larger than Claude's identified small particles. Claude later created a method to separate these two fractions, identifying one with smaller particles (original preparation size) and the other with larger particles (size Bensley identified as mitochondria).

## What method did Claude devise to distinguish different cellular particles?

Claude devised a method of separating two different fractions of cellular particles through successive centrifugation runs. This method allowed him to distinguish between smaller particles (the size of his original preparation) and larger particles (the size Bensley had identified as mitochondria).

## How did Claude and the Rockefeller group advance cell biology over Bensley?

Claude and the Rockefeller group convincingly established the role of the mitochondrion in cellular energetics, clearly linking function, as determined biochemically, to structure, which was identified cytologically. This contrasted with Bensleyâ€™s view of mitochondria as temporary structures, thereby making Claude's research more productive and widely accepted.
