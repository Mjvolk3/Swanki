## What were the two primary types of structures identified in the cytoplasm through Claude's research? Provide context for the identified structures.

The two primary types of structures identified in the cytoplasm through Claude's research were mitochondria and the lace-like reticulum/microsomes. Mitochondria were recognized as the power plants of the cell, and the microsomes were a new cell component.

## What did the "cell sap" or cytosol correspond to in the study's fractionation procedure? Give details about the fraction and related components.

The "cell sap" or cytosol corresponded to the supernatant in the study's fractionation procedure, which is the gel-like aqueous component of the cell.

## What was the primary function of mitochondria as characterized by morphologists and biochemists during the research?

Morphologists and biochemists characterized mitochondria as the power plants of the cell.

## What were the two additional steps required for further development of the cellular mechanisms account according to the paper?

The two additional steps required for further development of the cellular mechanisms account were:
1. Decomposing the already discovered organelles to show how their component parts contributed differentially to their functioning.
2. Finding the organelles presumed to be associated with other cell functions.
