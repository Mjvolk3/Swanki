## What was one key observation made by Hogeboom and Adams regarding the enzyme tyrosinase?

Hogeboom and Adams observed that when the fractionation process using ammonium sulfate was extended, most of the tyrosinase activity appeared in the sediment. This suggested that the tyrosinase enzyme might be associated with a particulate component of the cell, such as microsomes.

## Explain the process that Hogeboom and Adams used to isolate enzymes from mouse melanoma cells.

Hogeboom and Adams used cell fractionation techniques to isolate enzymes from mouse melanoma cells. They first obtained a supernatant that catalyzed reactions of both tyrosine and dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa). By creating two different precipitates with varying saturations of ammonium sulfate, they were able to separate enzymes: one precipitate catalyzed the tyrosine reaction, while the other catalyzed the dopa reaction.

## Describe the collaboration between Claude and Dean Burk from Cornell, as mentioned in the Annual Report for 1941-2.

Claude and Dean Burk's collaboration revealed that both large and small granule fractions of the cell were capable of taking up oxygen. They hypothesized that these granules, which contained significant amounts of iron and copper, might be associated with the cell's oxydoreduction activity. Additionally, they suggested that the larger granules could be secretory granules.

## Briefly explain why Claude believed collaboration with biochemists was necessary, as noted in the Annual Report for 1940-1.

Claude recognized the need for collaboration with biochemists to identify the enzyme constitution of cell fractions. He noted that other laboratories had already demonstrated the association of cell components with activities such as cytochrome oxidase, succinic acid dehydrogenase, and phosphatase. Therefore, methods to extend the study of cell function were essential for understanding cell metabolism.
