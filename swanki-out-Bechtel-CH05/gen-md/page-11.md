## Describe the collaboration between Brachet, Chantrenne, and Jeener, and their findings in the isolation of cytoplasmic particles.

Brachet, Chantrenne, and Jeener collaborated to isolate particles similar to microsomes using Emile Henriot's air-driven centrifuge. They called these "cytoplasmic particles of macromolecular dimension" and found that nearly all cytoplasmic RNA, along with several hydrolytic and respiratory enzymes, were located in them. They speculated that hydrolytic enzymes could work in reverse due to the energy released by respiratory enzymes, potentially synthesizing peptide bonds.

## What impact did World War II have on Brachet's research?

World War II had a significant impact on Brachet's research. The Germans closed Brussels University in 1942, leading to Brachet's arrest and imprisonment for nearly three months. Following his release, Allied bombing made it impossible for him to work in Liége. During this interruption, he wrote "Chemical Embryology." After the war, Brachet reestablished his laboratory in Brussels under difficult financial circumstances and resumed research on RNA metabolism during protein synthesis.

## What actions did Brachet take to protect his laboratory equipment during the German occupation of Belgium?

During the German occupation of Belgium, Brachet took measures to hide all laboratory equipment, including instruments given by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1938. These instruments were sought by the Germans but were not found. Brachet's actions ensured that the equipment remained safe and continued to be used in the laboratory after the war.

## What measures did Brussels University and the Rockefeller Foundation take to support Brachet after World War II?

After World War II, Brussels University supported Brachet by appointing a new technician, providing funds (10,000 frs) to get a larger ultracentrifuge in working order, and planning the construction of new laboratories. The University also approved Brachet's proposal for the creation of the 'groupment d'études de biologie physicochique' to strengthen ties between biologists, chemists, and physicists.
