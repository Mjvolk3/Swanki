### Card 1

## What was Porter's goal when continuing his transplant studies and what were the initial findings?

Porter's goal was to demonstrate cytoplasmic influences upon development by comparing embryos into whose cytoplasm he transplanted the nucleus of a different race with normal embryos of that race. The results indicated a genetic effect of the cytoplasm as well as of the nucleus.

### Card 2

## What inhibition of growth from carcinogenic agents did Porter investigate, and what methods did he use?

Porter investigated the inhibition of growth from carcinogenic agents, including X-rays and chemicals such as methylcholanthrene. He examined both the effects of different dosages on tail regeneration in newts and the character of the tissue reaction induced.

## How did Porter contribute to the use of the electron microscope in the laboratory?

Porter proposed using tissue-cultured cells to produce sufficiently thin specimens for electron microscopy. Working with Claude and Fullam at Interchemical Corporation, Porter produced a composite electron micrograph of a whole chick embryo cell.

### Card 4

## What structural details did Porter et al. observe in the electron micrograph of a fibroblast-like cell and cultured nerve fibers from a chick embryo?

In the electron micrograph, Porter et al. observed:

- Filamentous mitochondria of various lengths and fairly constant width.
- Scattered small elements of high density, presumably representing Golgi bodies.
- A delicate lace-work extending throughout the cytoplasm.
- The nucleus, visible but blurred due to excessive thickness.
- Three nerve fibers with specific details mentioned in the text.
