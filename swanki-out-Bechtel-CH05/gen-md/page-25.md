## In the context of the study, what was Porter and Claude's term for the ground substance which appeared particulate in nature, and what was its estimated size range?

Porter and Claude referred to the ground substance as "spongioplasm" and reported that it appeared to be comprised of particulate elements 30 to $150 \mathrm{~m} \mu$ in diameter.

## What are microsomes and what size were they estimated to be in extracts of normal chick embryos and Chicken Tumor I?

Microsomes are small particles that were estimated to average about $70 \mathrm{~m} \mu$ in diameter.

## Describe the second significant observation made by Porter and Claude and its initial ambiguity.

The second observation was a lace-like reticulum running through the thinner parts of the cell. Initially, they had "no idea what the lace-like stuff was inside the cytoplasm," and it was noted of particular interest that it fragmented in tissue-cultured cells.
