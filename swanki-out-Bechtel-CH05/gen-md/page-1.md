## Define cell fractionation and its significance in cell biology.

Cell fractionation is a process used to separate cellular components while preserving their individual functions. This technique allows scientists to isolate different organelles and analyze their specific functions, which is crucial for understanding the overall workings of cells.

### Significance:
Cell fractionation was pivotal in the study of cellular functions and the identification of organelles like mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. This technique enabled the separation and study of these organelles independently, providing insights into their roles in energy capture and protein synthesis.

## What role did electron microscopy play in the advancement of cell biology in the 1940s?

Electron microscopy is a technique that uses a beam of electrons to create an image of the specimen. It has a much higher resolution than light microscopy, which allows for the visualization of much smaller components of cells, such as organelles.

### Role:
Electron microscopy played a crucial role in the 1940s by revealing the intricate details of cell organelles and their structures. The enhanced resolution allowed scientists to visualize and identify the mitochondrion and the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a deeper understanding of their functions.

## Summarize the primary focus of early cell biology and the shift observed by the end of the 1940s.

### Early Focus:
The primary focus of early cell biology was on cell reproduction and the activities carried out by chromosomes during cell division. This focus was primarily on the nucleus and the processes it governed.

### Shift Observed:
By the end of the 1940s, the focus had shifted towards understanding functions performed in the cytoplasm, such as energy capture and protein synthesis. This shift was facilitated by the identification of the mitochondrion and the endoplasmic reticulum as key organelles responsible for these functions.

## Describe the contribution of the Rockefeller Institute laboratory to cell biology.

### Contribution:
The laboratory at the Rockefeller Institute, led by scientists like Albert Claude, Keith Porter, and George Palade, played a pivotal role in establishing the link between cell structures and their functions. Their pioneering research in cell fractionation and electron microscopy led to the identification of the mitochondrion and the endoplasmic reticulum and their associated functions.
