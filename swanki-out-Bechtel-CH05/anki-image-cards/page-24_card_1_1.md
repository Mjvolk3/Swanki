The electron micrograph (left side) provides a detailed view of cellular structures, such as filamentous mitochondria and scattered high-density elements likely representing Golgi bodies, along with intricate cytoplasmic lace-work. The photomicrograph (right side) taken using a light microscope provides far less detail due to the limitations of optical resolution.
