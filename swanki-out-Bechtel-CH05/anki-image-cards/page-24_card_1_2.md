Electron microscopy provides significantly enhanced detail of cellular structures compared to light microscopy. In the left electron micrograph, detailed structures like filamentous mitochondria, Golgi bodies, and intricate cytoplasmic lace-work are visible. In contrast, the right photomicrograph, taken using a light microscope, offers less detail due to the limitations of optical resolution.

The electron micrograph on the left reveals detailed cellular structures such as filamentous mitochondria, scattered high-density elements likely representing Golgi bodies, and intricate cytoplasmic lace-work. Arrows in the image point to cellular features referred to as "jagged points" and "finger-like processes."
