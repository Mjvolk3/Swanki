## Define cell fractionation and its significance in cell biology.

Cell fractionation is a process used to separate cellular components while preserving their individual functions. This technique allows scientists to isolate different organelles and analyze their specific functions, which is crucial for understanding the overall workings of cells.

### Significance:
Cell fractionation was pivotal in the study of cellular functions and the identification of organelles like mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. This technique enabled the separation and study of these organelles independently, providing insights into their roles in energy capture and protein synthesis.

## What role did electron microscopy play in the advancement of cell biology in the 1940s?

Electron microscopy is a technique that uses a beam of electrons to create an image of the specimen. It has a much higher resolution than light microscopy, which allows for the visualization of much smaller components of cells, such as organelles.

### Role:
Electron microscopy played a crucial role in the 1940s by revealing the intricate details of cell organelles and their structures. The enhanced resolution allowed scientists to visualize and identify the mitochondrion and the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a deeper understanding of their functions.

## Summarize the primary focus of early cell biology and the shift observed by the end of the 1940s.

### Early Focus:
The primary focus of early cell biology was on cell reproduction and the activities carried out by chromosomes during cell division. This focus was primarily on the nucleus and the processes it governed.

### Shift Observed:
By the end of the 1940s, the focus had shifted towards understanding functions performed in the cytoplasm, such as energy capture and protein synthesis. This shift was facilitated by the identification of the mitochondrion and the endoplasmic reticulum as key organelles responsible for these functions.

## Describe the contribution of the Rockefeller Institute laboratory to cell biology.

### Contribution:
The laboratory at the Rockefeller Institute, led by scientists like Albert Claude, Keith Porter, and George Palade, played a pivotal role in establishing the link between cell structures and their functions. Their pioneering research in cell fractionation and electron microscopy led to the identification of the mitochondrion and the endoplasmic reticulum and their associated functions.

## What analytical technique did Brachet use to deduce that the red-stained nucleic acids in sea urchin eggs were RNA?

Brachet used ribonuclease treatment, which digests RNA, to deduce that the red-stained nucleic acids were RNA. When treated with ribonuclease, the red stain was removed, indicating the presence of RNA.

## Describe the correlation found by Jean Brachet between RNA and protein synthesis in growing oocytes?

Jean Brachet found that the amount of RNA was closely correlated with protein synthesis activity. He hypothesized that RNA played a role in protein synthesis, although the exact mechanism was unclear.

$$
\text{The conclusion to which we are led is that the pentosenucleic acids [RNA] might intervene, by a mechanism as yet obscure, in the synthesis of proteins}
$$

## Discuss the historical context of Brachet's study concerning the identification of thymonucleic acid and zymonucleic acid.

During the late 1920s, thymonucleic acid (DNA) was thought to occur only in animals, while zymonucleic acid (RNA) was primarily found in plants, although also recognized in the pancreas of animals. The differentiation of these nucleic acids was challenged by Brachet's discoveries regarding RNA's role in protein synthesis.

- #history-of-biology, #nucleic-acids.classification

## What staining method allowed Brachet to attempt the localization of DNA in growing oocytes, and what was its result?

Brachet made use of the Feulgen reaction, which stains DNA green. This early histochemical method allowed him to differentiate between DNA and RNA, leading to his focus on RNA when observing that pyronine-stained substances in sea urchin eggs were RNA.

## Describe the collaboration between Brachet, Chantrenne, and Jeener, and their findings in the isolation of cytoplasmic particles.

Brachet, Chantrenne, and Jeener collaborated to isolate particles similar to microsomes using Emile Henriot's air-driven centrifuge. They called these "cytoplasmic particles of macromolecular dimension" and found that nearly all cytoplasmic RNA, along with several hydrolytic and respiratory enzymes, were located in them. They speculated that hydrolytic enzymes could work in reverse due to the energy released by respiratory enzymes, potentially synthesizing peptide bonds.

- #biochemistry, #cell-biology.ribosomes, #collaboration

## What impact did World War II have on Brachet's research?

World War II had a significant impact on Brachet's research. The Germans closed Brussels University in 1942, leading to Brachet's arrest and imprisonment for nearly three months. Following his release, Allied bombing made it impossible for him to work in Liége. During this interruption, he wrote "Chemical Embryology." After the war, Brachet reestablished his laboratory in Brussels under difficult financial circumstances and resumed research on RNA metabolism during protein synthesis.

- #history, #academic-impact, #world-war-ii

## What actions did Brachet take to protect his laboratory equipment during the German occupation of Belgium?

During the German occupation of Belgium, Brachet took measures to hide all laboratory equipment, including instruments given by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1938. These instruments were sought by the Germans but were not found. Brachet's actions ensured that the equipment remained safe and continued to be used in the laboratory after the war.

- #laboratory-management, #history.wwii, #brachet

## What measures did Brussels University and the Rockefeller Foundation take to support Brachet after World War II?

After World War II, Brussels University supported Brachet by appointing a new technician, providing funds (10,000 frs) to get a larger ultracentrifuge in working order, and planning the construction of new laboratories. The University also approved Brachet's proposal for the creation of the 'groupment d'études de biologie physicochique' to strengthen ties between biologists, chemists, and physicists.

## Describe the contributions of Brachet to molecular biology in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

Brachet's research in the late 1940s and early 1950s significantly contributed to the development of molecular biology by exploring the roles of different forms of RNA in protein synthesis. He linked RNA and protein synthesis, connecting RNA to the particles that Claude labeled microsomes. Despite this, his work did not exert the same impact as the Rockefeller laboratory's contributions to cell biology.

- #biology.molecular-biology, #history-of-science


## What may have limited the impact of Brachet's research compared to that of the Rockefeller laboratory?

Several factors likely limited the impact of Brachet's research compared to the Rockefeller laboratory:
1. Brachet and his collaborators focused solely on RNA and protein synthesis.
2. Electron microscopy was not central to their research.
3. They did not commit to differentiating distinct cell fractions representing different functions, unlike Claude's broader vision that shaped the Rockefeller laboratory's agenda in cell biology.

- #biology.cell-biology, #research-impact


## What role did electron microscopy play in the research developments at Chantrenne's laboratory in the late 1950s?

In the late 1950s, new buildings were constructed for Chantrenne, which included an electron microscope purchased with funds from the Rockefeller Foundation. This advanced microscope was crucial for the developments in molecular biology and cell biology, although Brachet's team did not heavily employ electron microscopy in their research.

## How did Caspersson contribute to our understanding of the relationship between nucleic acids and proteins?

Caspersson, a student of Einar Hammarsten at the Karolinska Institute, made significant advancements in understanding the relationship between nucleic acids and proteins through spectrographic analysis. His work paralleled Brachet's in linking RNA and protein synthesis and was supported by substantial grants, including those from the Wallenberg and Rockefeller Foundations.

- #science.spectrography, #biology.molecular-biology

## What innovation in spectroscopy did Caspersson develop under Hammarsten's supervision?

Caspersson developed methods for ultraviolet spectrography that combined a spectroscope and a microscope with a quartz lens, allowing estimation of nucleic acid content in different parts of living cells by relying on the strong absorption of light at 2600 \AA by pyrimidines in nucleic acids.

$$
\text{Absorption wavelength of pyrimidines} = 2600 \text{ \AA}
$$
    
- #cell-biology, #spectroscopy.ultraviolet, #instrumentation

## How did Caspersson's photoelectric apparatus for ultraviolet-microspectrography work?

Caspersson's photoelectric apparatus for ultraviolet-microspectrography relied on the following components and steps: the light passed through living cells, was concentrated in the microscope with an iris and a quartz-prism, and oriented using fluorescent glass and mirrors. Movements within the light-bundle facilitated the process.

- #optics, #ultraviolet.microspectrography, #instrumentation

---

## Describe the strategy Caspersson's institute used to balance instrument development and biological research, as per his 1953 report.

In his 1953 report, Caspersson described that his institute carefully divided its resources so that half were devoted to developmental work on instruments, and the other half to biological research focused on intracellular protein synthesis regulation. This balance was maintained even though a larger share in biological work would have made it financially easier.

$$
\text{Instrument Development} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{Total Resources}
$$

$$
\text{Biological Research} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{Total Resources}
$$

## How did World War II impact Caspersson's plans of working with the Rockefeller Foundation?

World War II delayed Caspersson's plans to be a Rockefeller Foundation fellow with Lewis. Initially, Jack Schultz's visit to Stockholm postponed the plans, but the outbreak of the war eventually prevented Caspersson's travel to the United States. Despite this, the Rockefeller Foundation continued supporting Caspersson with grants-in-aid throughout the war.

- #historical-context, #world-war-ii, #research-grants

## Explain how Caspersson utilized microscopy and photocells to measure substances in cell structures.

Caspersson used a system combining a microscope, prism, and photocell to measure substances in cell structures. By moving an enlarged picture (magnified 15,000 times) along perpendicular coordinates, he could focus on small areas within different cellular structures. Deviations in the filament-electrometer connected to the photocell, observed under a microscope, provided quantitative measurements of these areas.

- #biochemistry, #microscopy.measurement 
- #biochemistry, #cell-biology.localization 
  
## What was the significant contribution of Caspersson's work with ultraviolet illumination?

Caspersson discovered that nucleic acids and proteins had different absorption spectra under ultraviolet illumination. This allowed him to measure the local quantities of both in various cell structures and observe that nucleic acid levels peaked during cell division.

## How did Caspersson's view on the role of nucleic acids evolve?

Caspersson initially concluded that nucleic acids were not genetic material but were necessary for the reproduction and self-replication of proteins. He noted a probable connection between gene duplication and the presence of nucleic acids, indicating their role as prerequisites for the reproduction of genes and the multiplication of self-reproducing protein molecules.

## Summarize Caspersson's view on chromosomes and protein synthesis.

Caspersson correlated nucleic acids with protein synthesis, focusing on the self-replication of proteins in chromosomes during metaphase and linking it to DNA in the euchromatic region. He associated cytoplasmic proteins with the heterochromatic regions and emphasized the nucleolus's regulatory function in protein synthesis occurring in the nucleus outside the nucleolus. He concluded that polynucleotides are essential for protein synthesis, and the cell nucleus is central to protein production.

## What was the relationship between RNA presence and protein synthesis identified by Caspersson?

Caspersson found that the rapidity of protein synthesis in living bacteria is a simple, almost linear function of the amount of ribose nucleotides. He observed increased RNA levels in the interphase chromosome, nucleolus, and cytoplasm and correlated these increases with protein synthesis, although he remained vague about the exact role of RNA, still considering self-reproducing proteins as the genetic material.

- #biology.molecular-biology, #protein-synthesis.role-of-rna

## Summarize the general findings and limitations of Caspersson's work on protein synthesis.

Caspersson demonstrated that there is a nearly linear relationship between the amount of ribose nucleotides (RNA) and protein synthesis in bacteria. He noticed increased RNA levels in specific cell regions and hypothesized a correlation with protein synthesis. However, he was vague about the precise role of RNA, localizing protein synthesis in the nucleus without addressing RNA's specific role in the cytoplasm. Later evaluations criticized the accuracy and significance of his findings, acknowledging that the idea of RNA's correlation with protein synthesis was also noted by Brachet using simpler methods.

- #biology.protein-synthesis, #scientific-research.evaluation

## Which aspects of protein synthesis did Caspersson fail to explain, according to later evaluations?

Caspersson failed to adequately explain the specific role of RNA in protein synthesis and the newly made proteins' role in the cytoplasm. While he correlated RNA presence with protein synthesis, his descriptions were vague and inaccurate upon later review. Evaluators noted that he had not produced substantial significant findings in more recent years.

- #biology.protein-synthesis, #scientific-research.criticisms

## What did Caspersson conclude about viruses through his research?

Caspersson concluded that viruses take over the normal protein synthesis mechanisms of host cells. This conclusion was part of his broader investigations into protein synthesis and the interplay between nucleotides and proteins, where he studied changes in RNA levels and their correlation with protein synthesis.

- #biology.virology, #protein-synthesis.mechanisms

## What were some of the limitations of Caspersson's research impact in cell biology?

Despite his technical innovations, Caspersson's impact in the field of cell biology was limited because his focus remained on nucleic acids rather than the full range of cell activity.

- #biological-sciences, #cell-biology

---

## Which methods did Caspersson incorporate into his laboratory in 1946-7, and how did they impact his research focus?

Caspersson incorporated electron microscopy and cell fractionation into his laboratory in 1946-7. However, these techniques played a peripheral role as the laboratory remained focused primarily on cytochemistry.

- #biological-sciences, #research-methods

---

## Why might Bensley, Brachet, and Caspersson have failed to create laboratories with the same research breadth as the Rockefeller Institute in cell biology?

Bensley, Brachet, and Caspersson's research projects emerged from existing recognized problems in subdomains of cell biology. Consequently, they did not develop laboratories with the same breadth of research as the Rockefeller Institute, which had a more comprehensive approach to cell biology.

## Describe the role of Keith Porter and George Hogeboom in the Rockefeller Laboratory expansion under Claude.

Keith Porter joined the Rockefeller Laboratory in 1939 and George Hogeboom in 1941. Porter is noted for contributions to cell structure research (to be discussed later), while Hogeboom brought expertise in cytochemistry and biochemistry, initially working closely with Murphy on cancer projects.

- #biological-sciences, #research-contributions, #laboratory-expansion

## What was one key observation made by Hogeboom and Adams regarding the enzyme tyrosinase?

Hogeboom and Adams observed that when the fractionation process using ammonium sulfate was extended, most of the tyrosinase activity appeared in the sediment. This suggested that the tyrosinase enzyme might be associated with a particulate component of the cell, such as microsomes.

- #biology.cellular-mechanisms, #biochemistry.enzymes

## Explain the process that Hogeboom and Adams used to isolate enzymes from mouse melanoma cells.

Hogeboom and Adams used cell fractionation techniques to isolate enzymes from mouse melanoma cells. They first obtained a supernatant that catalyzed reactions of both tyrosine and dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa). By creating two different precipitates with varying saturations of ammonium sulfate, they were able to separate enzymes: one precipitate catalyzed the tyrosine reaction, while the other catalyzed the dopa reaction.

- #biology.cellular-mechanisms, #biochemistry.enzymes

## Describe the collaboration between Claude and Dean Burk from Cornell, as mentioned in the Annual Report for 1941-2.

Claude and Dean Burk's collaboration revealed that both large and small granule fractions of the cell were capable of taking up oxygen. They hypothesized that these granules, which contained significant amounts of iron and copper, might be associated with the cell's oxydoreduction activity. Additionally, they suggested that the larger granules could be secretory granules.

- #biology.cellular-mechanisms, #biochemistry.cell-fractions

## Briefly explain why Claude believed collaboration with biochemists was necessary, as noted in the Annual Report for 1940-1.

Claude recognized the need for collaboration with biochemists to identify the enzyme constitution of cell fractions. He noted that other laboratories had already demonstrated the association of cell components with activities such as cytochrome oxidase, succinic acid dehydrogenase, and phosphatase. Therefore, methods to extend the study of cell function were essential for understanding cell metabolism.

- #biology.cellular-mechanisms, #biochemistry.research-collaboration

## How did the researchers measure the enzyme activity in their study after 1945?

The researchers used a Warburg manometer to measure the rate of oxygen uptake by providing a substrate (e.g., succinic acid salt) to the enzyme fraction.

%

After 1945, enzyme activity was measured by adding a substrate such as succinic acid salt to the enzyme fraction and using a Warburg manometer to measure the rate of oxygen uptake. This rate was indicative of the enzyme's presence and activity.

- #biochemistry, #enzyme-kinetics.measurement

## In Table 5.1 of their 1943-1944 research, what was the observed activity of "Nuclease + Phosphatase" in the microsomes?

The activity observed was $+++{ }^{1}$ for "Nuclease + Phosphatase" in the microsomes.

%

Table 5.1 reports the activity of "Nuclease + Phosphatase" as $+++{ }^{1}$ in the microsomes, indicating a highly significant presence or activity in that fraction.

- #biochemistry, #enzyme-kinetics.activity

## What was the impact of war-related research on enzyme studies, as mentioned for the year 1944?

Research on enzyme studies, except for ribonuclease investigations, was suspended as Hogeboom was diverted to war-related research.

%

In 1944, all enzyme studies except ribonuclease investigations were suspended because Hogeboom was assigned to war-related research, highlighting the impact of external factors on scientific research priorities.

- #history-of-science, #biochemistry.historical-impact

## What substrates did "Dehydrogenase" and "Cytochrome Oxidase" use based on Table 5.1?

"Dehydrogenase" used $\alpha$-glycerophosphate, while "Cytochrome Oxidase" used ascorbic acid as their substrates.

%

According to Table 5.1, "Dehydrogenase" utilized $\alpha$-glycerophosphate, and "Cytochrome Oxidase" utilized ascorbic acid as their respective substrates, demonstrating the specificity of enzyme-substrate interactions.

- #biochemistry, #enzyme-kinetics.substrates

## How was the activity of cytochrome oxidase and succinoxidase distributed among different fractions?

Over three experiments, on average:

- $70 \%$ of cytochrome oxidase activity and $74 \%$ of succinoxidase activity was found in the large granule fraction.
- Less than $4 \%$ of cytochrome oxidase activity and $7 \%$ of succinoxidase activity was found in the microsome fraction.

The researchers attributed the minor activity in the microsome fraction to contamination by large granules or their fragments.

- #biology, #biochemistry.cell-fractionation

## What was the approach taken by the researchers after the war to interpret cell fractionation results?

After the war, the researchers adopted the "one enzyme-one fraction" approach. They aimed to link the activity of a given enzyme exclusively to one fraction, rather than determining the amount of enzyme activity in various fractions.

This shift marked the beginning of this approach in interpreting cell fractionation results.

- #biology, #biochemistry.cell-fractionation

## What were the key observations made by the researchers regarding the localization of cytochrome oxidase and succinoxidase?

The key observation made by the researchers was: "Taken together, these observations suggest that the cytochrome oxidase and succinoxidase systems... are entirely localized in the so-called large granules."

This conclusion was based on their findings of enzyme activity in different cell fractions.

- #biology, #biochemistry.cell-fractionation

## Why did Schneider and Palade join Claude's laboratory, and what were their backgrounds?

Schneider and Palade joined Claude's laboratory to continue investigations into the biochemistry of cell fractions. 

- Walter Schneider: Completed his Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin in 1945.
- George Palade: Native of Romania, studied medicine at the University of Bucharest, conducted physiological research on dolphin kidneys, taught anatomy during the war, and began working on cellular membranes with Robert Chambers before joining Claude's lab.

## What did Peyton Rous discover at the Rockefeller Institute in 1909 that contributed to the field of cell biology?

Peyton Rous discovered that a tumor in a chicken could be transmitted from one animal to another by inoculation with either small portions of the tumor or a filtered extract that strained out all cancer cells. He concluded that the tumor was carried by "viral agents," which were infectious entities not bacterial in nature.

- period.biology.cell-biology
- period.biology.virology

## Explain how the agent responsible for the Rous chicken sarcoma was characterized and its implications on the understanding of cancer.

Rous demonstrated that the agent responsible for the chicken sarcoma was present in a cell-free extract and could be transmitted even when tumor cells were killed with ultraviolet light, indicating it was not bacterial. This led to the understanding that the agent might be viral, contributing significantly to the study of cancer by suggesting that viral agents could induce tumors.

## What shift in research focus did James Murphy undergo after initially investigating cancer and lymphocytes?

Initially focusing on the possible role of lymphocytes in resisting cancer, James Murphy shifted his attention back to the agent responsible for the Rous chicken sarcoma. Murphy hypothesized that the agent might have an "enzyme-like nature," building on Rous' findings that indicated the agent was not bacterial and could withstand ultraviolet light destruction.

## Describe the process of lyophilization and its relevance to the research conducted by Murphy and Rous. 

Lyophilization, or freeze-drying, is the dehydration of a substance at low temperatures to preserve it. Murphy, while working under Rous, determined that this process could effectively preserve the agent responsible for the Rous chicken sarcoma, which further supported the notion that the agent was not bacterial and might be viral or enzyme-like in nature.

## What medium did Hogeboom, Schneider, and Palade (1948) explore for cell fractionation, and what was one key observation?

Hogeboom, Schneider, and Palade (1948) explored sucrose as a medium for cell fractionation. They observed that with approximately isotonic $(0.25 \text{ M})$ sucrose, the large granules did not agglutinate and were roughly the same size as with isotonic saline. However, the particles did not retain the elongated shape of mitochondria.

- #biology, #cell-fractionation, #experimental-techniques

## How did hypertonic sucrose solutions affect the particles observed by Hogeboom, Schneider, and Palade (1948)?

When Hogeboom, Schneider, and Palade (1948) used more hypertonic sucrose solutions, the particles became more elongated. The percentage of rod-like shapes reached a maximum with $0.8$ to $1.0 \text{ M}$ sucrose solutions. The researchers adopted $0.88 \text{ M}$ sucrose solutions for their research.

- #biology, #cell-fractionation, #experimental-techniques

## What stain did the researchers use to identify mitochondria in their experiments, and how did they distinguish between mitochondrial and secretory granules?

The researchers used Janus green B, a stain selective for mitochondria, to identify these organelles. They distinguished between mitochondrial and secretory granules by noting that mitochondria stained with Janus green B, while secretory granules stained with neutral red and broke up after cell membrane rupture, migrating centripetally.

- #biology, #cell-fractionation, #cell-structure

## What was one significant finding from Hogeboom and colleagues' improved fractionation procedures regarding the composition of mitochondria and microsome fractions?

One significant finding from Hogeboom and colleagues' improved fractionation procedures was that mitochondria contained nearly all the succinoxidase enzyme system. Additionally, they found that the microsome fraction contained about $50\%$ of the pentose nucleic acid.

- #biology, #cell-fractionation, #biochemical-analysis

## Why did Claude doubt the findings of both Caspersson and Brachet regarding the role of RNA in protein synthesis?

Claude doubted the findings of both Caspersson and Brachet regarding the role of RNA in protein synthesis because he questioned how protein synthesis could proceed once separated from the site of oxidative respiration.

Additionally, he speculated that RNA may be involved in anaerobic respiration "either in some phase of the anaerobic mechanism, or act as intermediate in the energy transfer for various synthetic reactions" (p. 163).

- #biology, #cell-biology.rna-function


## In Claude's 1948 Harvey Lecture, how did he describe the mitochondria?

Claude described mitochondria as the locus of key oxidative processes and referred to them as "the real power plants of the cell," indicating their essential role in providing the bulk of the energy for cell functioning.

- #biology, #cell-biology.mitochondria-function


## What role did Claude speculate RNA plays in anaerobic respiration?

Claude speculated that RNA might be involved "either in some phase of the anaerobic mechanism, or act as intermediate in the energy transfer for various synthetic reactions" (p. 163).

The basis for his speculation was the correlation of both RNA and fermentation in yeast and some bacteria.

- #biology, #cell-biology.rna-function


## What hypothesis did Claude propose about the distribution of metabolic activity and energy supply in the cell?

Claude hypothesized that "whereas most of the metabolic activity of the cell is found in the cytoplasm, the supply of energy may be segregated in various cytoplasmic entities: the aerobic respiration in the mitochondria, as already demonstrated, the anaerobic processes in the ground substance."

This might explain:
- The intense basophilia of cells in young embryos,
- Fast-growing tissues, and 
- Tumors, especially in areas where the circulation and the fresh supply of oxygen may be inadequate or defective.

- #biology, #cell-biology.energy-metabolism

## Describe the appearance of large particles from liver and mitochondria from leukemic cells under the electron microscope as reported by Claude in his Annual Report.

The large particles from liver and mitochondria from leukemic cells under the electron microscope appear as perfect opaque spheres 0.5 to $1.6 \mu$m in diameter. No definite membrane is evident in the prints. In instances where the granules are injured and some loss of substance has occurred, internal structure may be seen.

- #biology.cell-structure, #microscopy.electron

## What relationship did Claude suggest between large granules and microsomes?

Claude suggested that there is a relationship between large granules and microsomes because disrupted large granules in a test tube yield what appear to be microsomes. This observation, taken together with the internal structure seen in injured granules, supports this relationship.

- #biology.cell-structure, #cell-biology.granules

## What inference did Claude make about the mitochondrial membrane and what was his evidence?

Claude inferred the presence of a mitochondrial membrane based on the behavior of mitochondria when some contents had escaped. He noted that the loss of substance seems to release the tension which keeps the mitochondrial body spherical, implying that mitochondria possess a differentiated covering.

- #biology.cell-structure, #mitochondria

## How did the use of sufficient salt in the media affect the mitochondria during fractionation as observed by Claude?

Claude observed that using sufficient salt in the media during fractionation retained the shape and discreteness of mitochondria. This suggested that the proper tonicity was critical to maintaining mitochondrial integrity, contrary to the assumption that mitochondria may be formed by the concretion of substances preexisting in the cytoplasm or that they might disappear and reappear in living cells due to changes in the surrounding protoplasm.

## What was Porter's goal when continuing his transplant studies and what were the initial findings?

Porter's goal was to demonstrate cytoplasmic influences upon development by comparing embryos into whose cytoplasm he transplanted the nucleus of a different race with normal embryos of that race. The results indicated a genetic effect of the cytoplasm as well as of the nucleus.

## What inhibition of growth from carcinogenic agents did Porter investigate, and what methods did he use?

Porter investigated the inhibition of growth from carcinogenic agents, including X-rays and chemicals such as methylcholanthrene. He examined both the effects of different dosages on tail regeneration in newts and the character of the tissue reaction induced.

### Card 3

## How did Porter contribute to the use of the electron microscope in the laboratory?

Porter proposed using tissue-cultured cells to produce sufficiently thin specimens for electron microscopy. Working with Claude and Fullam at Interchemical Corporation, Porter produced a composite electron micrograph of a whole chick embryo cell.

- #microscopy #electron-microscope

### Card 4

## What structural details did Porter et al. observe in the electron micrograph of a fibroblast-like cell and cultured nerve fibers from a chick embryo?

In the electron micrograph, Porter et al. observed:

- Filamentous mitochondria of various lengths and fairly constant width.
- Scattered small elements of high density, presumably representing Golgi bodies.
- A delicate lace-work extending throughout the cytoplasm.
- The nucleus, visible but blurred due to excessive thickness.
- Three nerve fibers with specific details mentioned in the text.

- #cell-biology #electron-micrograph.structures

## What did Porter, Claude, and Fullam observe about the mitochondria in their 1945 electron micrograph?

Porter, Claude, and Fullam noted that mitochondria appeared as elongated rod-like structures possessing areas of increased density and extremely small granules with diameters ranging from 10 to $20 \mu m$. They suggested that these granules could consist primarily of inorganic salts or represent centers where reduced osmium had accumulated.

- #biology.microscopy, #cell-biology.mitochondria

## According to the authors, why did the dense bodies with angular outlines observed in electron micrographs appear like Golgi bodies?

The authors attributed the osmophilic character of the dense bodies with angular outlines in electron micrographs to Golgi bodies. They suggested that these dense structures might represent accumulations of osmium, giving them their unique appearance.

- #cell-biology.golgi-apparatus, #biology.microscopy

## What challenge did Porter, Claude, and Fullam make in their Annual Report for 1944-5 regarding the interpretation of the Golgi apparatus?

In their Annual Report for 1944-5, Porter, Claude, and Fullam challenged the prevailing interpretation of the Golgi apparatus as an artifact of the preparation process. Their observations from the 1945 electron micrograph provided evidence against this artifact hypothesis.

- #biology.history, #cell-biology.golgi-apparatus

## What were the possible compositions proposed by the authors for the granules found in mitochondria?

The authors proposed two potential compositions for the granules found in mitochondria: they could either be composed primarily of inorganic salts or represent centers where reduced osmium had accumulated.

%

The electron micrograph (left side) provides a detailed view of cellular structures, such as filamentous mitochondria and scattered high-density elements likely representing Golgi bodies, along with intricate cytoplasmic lace-work. The photomicrograph (right side) taken using a light microscope provides far less detail due to the limitations of optical resolution.

## Describe how Claude and Porter investigated tumor cells using electron microscopy, and summarize their conclusions.

Claude and Porter utilized electron microscopy to examine tumor cells. In their investigation, they discovered "small granules of uniform size" with density greater than the surrounding cytoplasm. Studies on Chicken Tumor 1 and Chicken Tumor 10 cells revealed granules of similar structure, which were distinguishable due to their regular granular shape, relatively uniform size, and greater density in osmium preparations. The distribution patterns in the two tumor types varied: Chicken Tumor 10 particles formed colonies, while Chicken Tumor 1 particles were more dispersed. By 1947, they concluded that these particles were likely causative agents of the respective tumors and speculated on their replication through division.

## What primary discovery did Porter make in relation to the endoplasm, and what technique facilitated this discovery?

Porter's primary discovery in relation to the endoplasm was its finely divided reticulum structure with tiny bodies scattered along its strands, observable in osmium-fixed preparations under the electron microscope. The particulate components were believed to be the same as microsomes isolated by high-speed centrifugation. The technique facilitating this discovery was thin sectioning of cells combined with electron microscopy.

## What evidence did Porter provide to show that the endoplasm is the most active part of the living unit according to his observations in 1946-7?

Porter indicated that the endoplasm is “the most active part of the living unit,” as it is present in every explored cell form and constitutes the fibrillar apparatus surrounding the central body. He observed that the endoplasm generates fine extensions throughout the cell, suggesting a secretory role due to its vesicular structure, potentially determining the mosaic character of the egg cell.

## Describe the research method and findings of Porter and Helen Thompson (1947) concerning cultured cells from rat sarcomas.

In 1947, Porter and Helen Thompson examined cultured cells from three different rat sarcomas using electron microscopy. Their findings indicated a significantly greater density of endoplasmic granules located on shorter strands in these cancer cells. This observation helped in understanding the cellular structure and behavior of cancerous cells.

## Summarize Porter and Thompson's (1948) electron microscope study on mammary carcinoma in mice, including their hypothesis about the discovered particles.

In 1948, Porter and Thompson used an electron microscope to examine mammary gland tumor cells grown in tissue culture from mice. They discovered distinctive particles about $130 \text{ m} \mu$ in diameter with a dark, well-defined central core. Though the evidence was circumstantial, they hypothesized that these particles could be the viral agent present in the mother's milk, potentially transmitting the cancer.

## How did Claude's work in the 1940s contribute to the understanding of cell constitution through particle isolation and cell fractionation?

Claude's work in the 1940s focused on determining that normal cells contained particles similar in size to those isolated from tumor-causing fractions of Rous sarcoma cells. He increasingly concentrated on understanding the constitution of normal cells. His primary tool was cell fractionation, through which he developed standardized procedures to segregate cell components, thereby advancing the methodology for studying cellular structures and their functions.

## Explain the use and outcome of high-speed centrifugation in Claude's research.

Claude utilized high-speed centrifugation after reading the reports of Ledingham and Gye (1935) and McIntosh (1935). He found that this method allowed him to isolate a more potent tumor-causing agent. In 1938, he reported isolating an agent with ten to fifty times greater potency than the original extract using this technique.

## What inhibitory effect was identified through Claude's centrifugation study in Chicken Tumor 10 and how did he work around it?

In the 1937 Annual Report, Claude introduced centrifugation to address Chicken Tumor 10's transfer issues. He showed that the centrifuged particle could generate a tumor when combined with water, but not when combined with the supernatant from centrifugation. This suggested that the supernatant contained an inhibitor that prevented tumor development.

## What hypothesis did Claude initially consider and later find to be false regarding the granular particles he observed in cells?

Claude initially considered the hypothesis that the granular particles might be mitochondria. However, this hypothesis was later found to be false.

- #history, #hypotheses, #biology

## Explain the evidence Claude used to support his initial hypothesis that the granular particles might be mitochondria.

Claude advanced several pieces of evidence to support his hypothesis:
1. The particles were of similar size and shape as mitochondria.
2. They had a similar composition of phospholipids and nucleoproteins.
3. They exhibited similar responses to heat and acids.
4. Janus green dye, which has a selective affinity for mitochondria, caused the isolated particles to show identical properties, turning purple with this dye.

## What major conceptual shift did Claude's research undergo after recognizing critical components in both normal and tumor cells?

Claude's research underwent a major conceptual shift from focusing on cancer cells to investigating the constituents of normal cells. This shift was characterized by a new conceptual framework where what had been the tumor agent became reinterpreted as a cytoplasmic particle, transforming the entire research system.

- #research-transformation, #scientific-paradigm, #conceptual-framework

## Describe the importance of Janus green and methyl green dyes in Claude's research on granular particles and mitochondria.

Janus green and methyl green dyes played a crucial role in Claude's research by aiding in the identification of mitochondria. Janus green showed a selective affinity for mitochondria, turning the isolated particles purple under proper conditions. Methyl green made the cell nucleus brilliant green while mitochondria became purple, suggesting similar properties between the isolated particles and mitochondria.

## Explain the significance of Bensley and Gersh's findings regarding the nature of mitochondria when using various solvents. 

%

Bensley and Gersh found that fat solvents like acetone had no effect on mitochondria, whereas water, $0.02 \%$ ammonia solution, and artificial gastric juice dissolved them. They concluded that "the main mass of the mitochondria substance is protein in nature" (p. 230).

## What methods did Bensley and Hoerr use to separate nuclei, blood corpuscles, and connective tissues from the supernatant and sediment mitochondria? Describe the separation technique and speed used.

Bensley and Hoerr used a two-step centrifugation process to separate cellular components:
1. First, they performed centrifugation at slow speeds to remove nuclei, blood corpuscles, and connective tissues.
2. Next, they centrifuged the remaining supernatant at higher speeds for longer periods to sediment the mitochondria.

- #cell-biology, #separation-techniques, #centrifugation

## What was the observed average fat content by weight in mitochondrial particles according to Bensley and Hoerr's second paper?

Bensley and Hoerr's second paper showed that mitochondria comprised, on average, $43.6 \%$ fat by weight. The fat content analysis can be represented as:

$$
\text{Fat content in mitochondria} = 43.6\%
$$

## What did Lazarow discover about the smaller particles during his quantitative analysis and how did he relate these findings to mitochondrial particles?

Lazarow discovered a smaller particle that appeared cherry red when separated by centrifugation. He showed that the smaller particle contained more phosphorus and fat than the mitochondrial particles. He also demonstrated that both the mitochondrial fraction and this smaller particle oxidized succinic acid, indicating the presence of enzymes such as succinic dehydrogenase, cytochrome $c$, and cytochrome oxidase. This implies both particles had enzymatic capabilities.

\text{Mitochondrial particles} \\
\text{Smaller particles: More phosphorus and fat}

## What hypothesis did Bensley and Hoerr propose regarding the structural protein "elipsin" in their previous paper, and how does it relate to the integrity of cell structure after removal of other components?

Bensley and Hoerr proposed the existence of a structural protein they named "elipsin." They argued that elipsin maintains the cell as a unit of organic structure after the removal of soluble globulins, mitochondria, and chromatin. This suggests that elipsin is fundamental to the microscopic structure and organic continuity of the cell body.

$$
\text{Elipsin: Maintains cell structure post-removal of}
\begin{cases}
\text{Soluble globulins} \\
\text{Mitochondria} \\
\text{Chromatin}

## How did Bensley contribute to the field of cytology? 

Bensley was referred to by Cowdry as "the acknowledged founder of the new cytology." He, along with his graduate students, made many advances in the field before Claude and the Rockefeller group received significant recognition in the field. One significant distinction in his work was his belief that mitochondria were not permanent structures but rather coacervates that appear and are reabsorbed into the protoplasm. 

- #cell-biology, #history, #cytology

## What was a major difference in the interpretations of cell structures between Bensley and Claude?

Bensley and Claude had conflicting interpretations of the fractions derived from cell structures. While Claude initially identified smaller particles as mitochondria, Bensley and Hoerr had estimated that mitochondria were considerably larger than Claude's identified small particles. Claude later created a method to separate these two fractions, identifying one with smaller particles (original preparation size) and the other with larger particles (size Bensley identified as mitochondria). 

- #cell-biology, #history, #fractions

## What method did Claude devise to distinguish different cellular particles?

Claude devised a method of separating two different fractions of cellular particles through successive centrifugation runs. This method allowed him to distinguish between smaller particles (the size of his original preparation) and larger particles (the size Bensley had identified as mitochondria).

- #cell-biology, #methodology, #centrifugation

## How did Claude and the Rockefeller group advance cell biology over Bensley?

Claude and the Rockefeller group convincingly established the role of the mitochondrion in cellular energetics, clearly linking function, as determined biochemically, to structure, which was identified cytologically. This contrasted with Bensley’s view of mitochondria as temporary structures, thereby making Claude's research more productive and widely accepted. 

- #cell-biology, #mitochondria, #energetics

## How did Claude's analysis unveil the chemical differences between the smaller and larger particles according to the paper?

Claude's analysis indicated that both smaller and larger particles contained phospholipids, although the smaller particles contained about twice the percentage. Additionally, both types of particles contained ribose nucleic acids, iron, and copper.

- #cell-biology, #particulate-analysis

## Explain Claude's initial interpretation of the "large granule fraction" and how his view changed over time.

Initially, Claude thought the "large granule fraction" contained secretory particles, likely mitochondria. However, upon further investigation, he found the small particles to be a newly discovered cell constituent, different from mitochondria, and named them microsomes.

- #cell-biology, #mitochondria-evolution

## According to the discussion by Schultz and collaborators, what role did RNA play in the synthesis of proteins?

Schultz, collaborating with Caspersson, proposed that RNA played a crucial role in protein synthesis.

- #molecular-biology, #protein-synthesis

## What was Claude's argument regarding the ergastoplasm and how did this contrast with the views of other researchers at the time?

Claude argued that the ergastoplasm did not exist and was merely an artefact produced by fixatives containing strong acids. He cited that well-preserved mitochondria and ergastoplasm were rarely found in the same preparation, suggesting the ergastoplasm was just poorly fixed mitochondria. 

- #cell-biology, #microscopy-artifacts

## Describe Claude's centrifugation procedure for separating cell contents, including the specific conditions he used and the results he observed.

Claude's centrifugation procedure involved centrifuging whole liver cells from Amphiuma tridactylum for one hour at $18,000 \mathrm{~g}$. This caused the cell contents to separate into distinguishable layers while remaining within the cell membrane. By staining the cells with Bensley's stain (acid fuchsin-methyl green), Claude could vividly differentiate what he took to be secretory granules and mitochondria in red against a purple background. This resulted in four successive layers:

1. Glycogen
2. A combination of secretory granules and mitochondria that appeared red and also contained nuclei
3. The "purple substance" that he took to be microsomes
4. The true hyloplasm (cytosol)

- #cell-biology.centrifugation, #mitochondria-staining


## What was the primary criticism from Bensley's group regarding Claude's identification of secretory granules and mitochondria?

Bensley's group primarily criticized Claude's refusal to identify his large-granule fraction as essentially mitochondrial. They challenged his interpretation by arguing that the staining methods he used could differentiate between mitochondria and secretory granules. Hoerr specifically mentioned that Claude's methods of separation failed to produce pure preparations, instead yielding mixtures. Bensley's group preferred to refer to small particles as submicroscopic particulates rather than Claude's term microsomes.

- #cell-biology.criticism, #mitochondria-identification


## Explain Claude's additional finding in 1944 regarding the staining properties of the large granules extracted from guinea pig liver.

In 1944, Claude reported that the large granules extracted from guinea pig liver failed to stain with Janus green. Based on this observation, he concluded that liver may be a poor place to look for mitochondria. Subsequently, in a study on leukemic cells from rats, he contended that the large granule fraction consisted of true mitochondria.

- #cell-biology.staining-techniques, #mitochondria-verification


## Describe the distinction Claude made between microsomes and hyloplasm based on his centrifugation and staining results.

Using his centrifugation and staining technique, Claude distinguished microsomes from hyloplasm in the following manner:

1. The "purple substance," which he took to be microsomes.
2. The true hyloplasm (cytosol), which appeared as a distinct layer.

This differentiation helped in understanding the finer substructures within cell contents and was based on their appearance and staining characteristics in the centrifuged layers.
