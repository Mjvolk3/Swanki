**Entering the Terra Incognita between Biochemistry and Cytology**

In the mid-20th century, the landscape of biological research was transforming as new techniques from physics and chemistry began to permeate the boundaries of traditional biology. This convergence bridged the gap between biochemistry, which studies the chemical processes within living organisms, and cytology, the study of cell structure and function. This era saw the advent of powerful tools like cell fractionation and electron microscopy that opened up previously uncharted territories within cells. Researchers were no longer confined to what they could observe through light microscopes. Instead, they could now delve into the molecular and micellar organization of protoplasm, the complex substance within the cell.

One of the key breakthroughs during this period was the identification of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum as specific organelles responsible for energy capture and protein synthesis, respectively. This discovery was crucial because it provided a mechanistic understanding of how cells perform essential functions. The 1940s marked the beginning of this journey, and although the term "endoplasmic reticulum" wasn't coined until the early 1950s, the groundwork for understanding cellular machinery was being laid. This shift in focus from mere observation to functional analysis marked the dawn of modern cell biology.

At the Rockefeller Institute, a team led by Albert Claude, Keith Porter, and George Palade pioneered this new approach. Their research initially wasn't aimed at understanding cell function but evolved to make significant contributions to cell biology. They used cell fractionation methods to separate different cellular components and electron microscopy to visualize them, leading to the identification of various cellular organelles and their functions. This comprehensive approach set the stage for future discoveries and established a new paradigm in biological research.

**Linking Claude's Microsomes to Protein Synthesis**

Albert Claude's work on microsomes—tiny particulate components he identified in cell protoplasm—revealed the presence of RNA, a critical molecule in protein synthesis. Although Claude was cautious about assigning a specific function to these particles, his findings paved the way for others to explore the link between RNA and protein synthesis. Jean Brachet and Torbörn Caspersson were two key figures who used new cytochemical tools to establish this connection.

Brachet, while still a medical student, made significant strides in identifying RNA in growing oocytes. Using the Feulgen reaction, a staining technique for DNA, and ribonuclease treatments, he demonstrated that the intensely red-stained nucleic acid in sea urchin eggs was indeed RNA. This led him to hypothesize that RNA played a crucial role in protein synthesis. His collaboration with biochemist Raymond Jeener further reinforced this idea. They isolated particles similar to Claude's microsomes and found that these particles contained almost all cytoplasmic RNA, alongside various enzymes. They speculated that these enzymes could work in reverse, using energy from respiratory enzymes to synthesize peptide bonds, thereby contributing to protein synthesis.

World War II disrupted Brachet's research, but he resumed his work post-war, focusing on RNA metabolism during protein synthesis. Despite facing financial and infrastructural challenges, Brachet and his collaborators made significant contributions to our understanding of RNA's role in protein synthesis. However, their work did not have the same impact as the Rockefeller laboratory's efforts, perhaps because they did not emphasize electron microscopy or the differentiation of cellular fractions representing different functions. This underscores the importance of a broad vision and diverse methodologies in pioneering new scientific fields.

**Caspersson: Spectrographic Analysis, RNA, and Protein Synthesis**

During the same period, Torbörn Caspersson was making parallel advancements at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Caspersson's background in chemistry and his interest in developing new instruments led him to create methods for ultraviolet spectrography. By combining a spectroscope and a microscope with a quartz lens, he could measure nucleic acid content in living cells based on their absorption of ultraviolet light. This innovative approach allowed Caspersson to quantify nucleic acids and proteins in different cellular regions, providing valuable insights into their roles during cell division and protein synthesis.

Caspersson's work showed that nucleic acids and proteins had distinct absorption spectra under ultraviolet light, enabling him to measure their local concentrations. He discovered that nucleic acid levels peaked during cell division, suggesting a link between nucleic acids and gene duplication. However, Caspersson did not initially view DNA as the genetic material; instead, he believed that genes were proteins and that nucleic acids played a supporting role in protein self-replication. His collaboration with Jack Schultz further explored this idea, linking disturbances in nucleic acid metabolism with reproductive anomalies.

Caspersson's research also differentiated the roles of DNA and RNA in protein synthesis. He found that DNA was necessary for synthesizing proteins in genetic material, while RNA was crucial for cytoplasmic protein synthesis. He observed that the rate of protein synthesis in bacteria correlated linearly with the amount of RNA, reinforcing the interplay between nucleotides and proteins. Despite these significant findings, Caspersson remained vague about RNA's precise role and continued to view proteins as the primary genetic material. His work laid the groundwork for understanding the central role of RNA in protein synthesis, a concept that would become more widely accepted in the following decades.
**The War with Several Younger Researchers**

In the early 1940s, Holger Hydén, Bo Thorell, and Arne Enström were among the younger researchers engaging in intense scientific debates and collaborations with Torbjörn Caspersson. Caspersson was a pioneering figure whose work intersected with cytochemistry and the development of sophisticated instrumentation for biological research. He was known for his rigorous approach and high standards, which occasionally led to conflicts and disagreements. Despite these challenges, Caspersson's efforts were instrumental in advancing the understanding of nucleic acids and their role in protein synthesis, albeit with mixed reviews from his peers.

In the mid-1940s, as Caspersson moved into his new laboratory, he significantly expanded his research techniques to include electron microscopy and cell fractionation. This period marked a shift in focus, as he began to delve deeper into the ultrastructure of nerve fibers with the help of electron microscopist Fernández-Morán. Although Caspersson's work during this time did not set the agenda for cell biology, his contributions to the field were nonetheless valuable. His dedication to developing new instruments sometimes overshadowed his ability to generate groundbreaking biological insights.

Caspersson's legacy is somewhat paradoxical. While he trained several important junior scientists and contributed to the establishment of new research techniques, his later work was often criticized for lacking significant biological advances. Despite this, his early suggestion that ribonucleic acids are correlated with protein synthesis remained a cornerstone of molecular biology. His inability to broaden his research focus beyond nucleic acids possibly limited his impact compared to other contemporaries, such as Brachet, who used simpler techniques to achieve similar insights.

**Adding a Biochemical Perspective to the Rockefeller Laboratory**

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, the Rockefeller Laboratory began to undergo significant transformations under the influence of Albert Claude and his expanding team. One of the first new members was Keith Porter, who joined in 1939, and later, George Hogeboom in 1941. Together, they brought a wealth of expertise in cytochemistry and biochemistry, which was pivotal for advancing the laboratory's research. Initially, Hogeboom focused on chemotherapy studies, investigating substances like tetra-methyl-ortho-phenylene-diamine and rotenone, which are known to inhibit oxygen consumption in lymphosarcoma.

Hogeboom's work gradually evolved from cancer research to exploring normal cellular metabolism. One of his significant contributions was the isolation of tyrosine oxidase enzymes from mouse melanoma cells. By using cell fractionation techniques, he and his collaborator, Mark H. Adams, successfully separated two distinct enzymes involved in catalyzing reactions of tyrosine and dihydroxyphenylalanine. Their findings suggested that these enzymes were associated with particulate components of the cell, offering insights into their insolubility after precipitation by ammonium sulfate.

Claude recognized the necessity of collaborating with biochemists to fully understand the enzyme constitution of his cell fractions. In the early 1940s, he reported on various studies linking cell components with enzymatic activities such as cytochrome oxidase and succinic acid dehydrogenase. These collaborative efforts, including studies with Dean Burk and Rollin Hotchkiss, laid the groundwork for identifying specific enzymes in different cell fractions. This approach marked the beginning of a more systematic investigation into the biochemical activities of cellular components.

**Discovering Cell Mechanisms**

By the mid-1940s, the Rockefeller Laboratory had made substantial progress in understanding cell mechanisms, thanks to the meticulous work of Claude and his team. One of their key innovations was the adoption of the Warburg manometer to measure the activity of enzymes in different cell fractions. This device allowed them to quantify the rate of oxygen consumption, providing a clear metric for enzyme presence and activity. For instance, they used succinic acid salt as a substrate to measure succinic oxidase activity and cytochrome c for cytochrome oxidase activity.

Their experiments revealed that a significant portion of these enzymatic activities was localized in the large granule fraction of the cell, leading to the hypothesis that these granules were associated with mitochondria. This was a crucial step towards the "one enzyme-one fraction" approach, which aimed to link specific enzymes exclusively with particular cell fractions. The team meticulously documented their findings, attributing minor enzymatic activities in other fractions to contamination by large granules or their fragments.

The arrival of new investigators like Walter Schneider and George Palade further bolstered the laboratory's capabilities. Schneider brought expertise from one of the top biochemistry departments in the U.S., while Palade's background in physiological research on cellular membranes added a new dimension to their studies. Together with Hogeboom, they refined the techniques for identifying enzymes within cell fractions, using more sophisticated media like hypertonic sucrose solutions. This allowed them to more accurately distinguish mitochondria from other cellular components, solidifying the foundational understanding of cell biology.

**First Steps Toward Cell Biology at the Rockefeller Institute**

The pioneering efforts in cell biology at the Rockefeller Institute can be traced back to the cancer research laboratory of James Murphy. Murphy's work built on the foundational research of Peyton Rous, who had discovered that a chicken tumor could be transmitted via a filtered extract, suggesting the presence of viral agents. Rous's initial reluctance to focus on cancer research gave way to groundbreaking findings that laid the groundwork for Murphy's subsequent investigations.

Murphy, who took over the cancer research after Rous shifted his focus, explored the role of lymphocytes in cancer resistance. His studies suggested that the lack of lymphocytes in embryos and brain tissue correlated with a lack of resistance to tumor cells. By the late 1920s, Murphy turned his attention back to the Rous chicken sarcoma, investigating the nature of the tumor-causing agent. His experiments indicated that the agent might have an "enzyme-like nature," furthering the understanding of cancer's underlying mechanisms.

Albert Claude's introduction of cell fractionation at the Rockefeller Institute marked a significant advancement in cell biology. By isolating different cellular components and studying their biochemical activities, Claude and his team uncovered crucial insights into cellular respiration and metabolism. Their work established the model for modern cell biology, emphasizing the importance of linking specific enzymes to distinct cellular fractions. This approach not only advanced scientific knowledge but also set the standard for future research in the field.
### Discovering Cell Mechanisms

Hogeboom and his colleagues revolutionized our understanding of cellular components with their improved fractionation techniques. By breaking down cells into distinct fractions and analyzing their composition, they confirmed that mitochondria harbor nearly all the succinoxidase, an enzyme critical for the Krebs cycle. They also discovered that the microsome fraction contained about 50 percent of the cellular ribonucleic acid, or RNA. This was groundbreaking because Claude had earlier noted that these small particles were rich in RNA, but their function remained elusive. Despite these findings, Claude remained cautious and did not immediately conclude the role of microsomes, suggesting that their abundance and universal distribution imply a fundamental role in cellular operations, possibly related to protein synthesis or other synthetic reactions.

Claude was skeptical about the established theories that RNA played a role in protein synthesis, mainly because of the separation from oxidative respiration sites. Instead, he hypothesized that RNA might participate in anaerobic respiration, acting in energy transfer for various synthetic reactions. This idea stemmed from observed correlations between RNA and fermentation in yeast and certain bacteria. Such insights were crucial at the time, as they hinted at the complex roles RNA could play beyond its known functions, thereby opening new avenues for research.

In contrast to his uncertainty about microsomes, Claude was confident about the function of mitochondria. By localizing key oxidative enzymes within mitochondria, he proposed that these organelles were the primary powerhouses of the cell, generating most of the cell's energy. This was a pivotal moment in cell biology, as it linked mitochondria directly to energy production, reinforcing their importance in cellular metabolism.

### Adding Electron Microscopy as a Tool

In the early 1940s, Claude took advantage of the electron microscope at Interchemical Corporation, which provided unprecedented insights into cellular structures. The electron microscope allowed Claude to observe large and small granules produced by his fractionation method. The larger particles from liver cells and mitochondria from leukemic cells appeared as opaque spheres under the microscope. While intact mitochondria were too thick to reveal much detail, damaged ones allowed some internal structures to be seen. These observations suggested a relationship between large granules and smaller microsomes, hinting at a more complex internal organization within cells.

Claude's initial use of electron microscopy didn't yield comprehensive information about mitochondria or microsomes. However, Keith Porter, who joined Claude's lab in 1939, proposed using tissue-cultured cells to produce thinner specimens for electron microscopy. This approach resulted in a detailed image of a fibroblast-like cell and nerve fibers from chick embryo tissue, revealing the intricate structures within the cytoplasm. The comparison between electron micrographs and light microscope images highlighted the superior detail provided by electron microscopy, showcasing features like filamentous mitochondria, Golgi bodies, and a delicate lace-like network throughout the cytoplasm.

Porter's skills in micromanipulation and his innovative use of electron microscopy led to significant discoveries. For instance, he and Claude observed that the mitochondria appeared as elongated structures with areas of increased density and small granules, suggesting these might be composed of inorganic salts or centers of reduced osmium accumulation. These observations challenged earlier interpretations of cellular structures, such as the Golgi apparatus, and opened new research avenues. Over time, Porter and Claude's work revealed that the cytoplasmic ground substance, or spongioplasm, might be particulate in nature, further complicating our understanding of cellular organization.

### Entering the Terra Incognita between Biochemistry and Cytology

Claude and Porter’s electron microscopy work paved the way for new insights into cancer research. They found that tumor cells contained small, dense granules not commonly seen in normal cells. These granules were identified in different tumor types, leading to the hypothesis that they might be the causative agents of the tumors. By studying Chicken Tumor 1 and Chicken Tumor 10 cells, they noted the distribution and density of these granules, concluding that they possibly replicated by division and varied in size as they grew and split.

After these joint investigations, Claude and Porter focused on different aspects of cellular research. Claude worked on techniques for thinly sectioning cells, while Porter explored the structure and function of cultured cells. In particular, Porter’s work on the lace-like reticulum in the cytoplasm suggested a complex endoplasmic network, which was previously unobservable. This network appeared to be highly active, and its vesicular structure hinted at secretory functions. Porter proposed that this endoplasm might be crucial in determining the structural and functional organization of cells, particularly in egg cells.

Porter's observations indicated that the endoplasm comprised a fibrillar apparatus concentrated around the cell's central body and extended throughout the cell. This suggested that the endoplasm was integral to cellular activity and structure, influencing processes such as secretion and possibly even determining the cell's developmental fate. These findings were significant because they provided a deeper understanding of the cytoplasmic structures and their roles, bridging the gap between biochemistry and cytology and advancing our knowledge of cellular mechanisms.
**Studies of Cancer Cells**

In the mid-1940s, significant strides were made in the study of cancer cells by researchers such as Keith Porter and Helen Thompson. Their initial work involved examining cultured cells from rat sarcomas, a type of cancerous tumor, where they noted a higher density of endoplasmic granules on shorter strands within the cells. This suggested an unusual cellular structure in cancer cells that was different from normal cells. Another pivotal study was conducted on mammary carcinoma in mice. John Bittner had previously discovered that this type of cancer could be transmitted through the mother's milk. Porter and Thompson utilized electron microscopy to investigate mammary gland tumor cells cultured from mice. They identified distinct particles within these cells, measuring around 130 millimicrons in diameter, with a well-defined central core. They tentatively proposed that these particles could be the viral agents responsible for cancer transmission through milk, although their evidence was circumstantial at the time.

**State of Cell Studies at the End of the 1940s**

By the end of the 1940s, the research landscape at Rockefeller had undergone significant changes, with a broader focus on varied laboratories. Albert Claude's research had been instrumental during this period. Initially, he aimed to understand the constitution of normal cells, having recognized that particles of the same size existed in both normal cells and tumor-causing fractions from Rous sarcoma cells. Claude's primary tool was cell fractionation, a process that allowed him to separate different cellular components. Through this methodology, he identified two fractions of cytoplasmic particles and a nuclear fraction, along with a supernatant. Eventually, he concluded that the larger particles were primarily mitochondria, while the smaller ones were a new cellular component he named microsomes. These findings were refined over the decade, especially through collaboration with Porter, using electron microscopy to observe whole cells in tissue culture. This led to the identification of both mitochondria and a lace-like reticulum, which was related to the microsomes isolated earlier.

The emerging view of the cytoplasm was that it comprised mitochondria, the lace-like reticulum or microsomes, and a gel-like aqueous component known as the cytosol or cell sap. These structures were associated with distinct cellular activities. Mitochondria were quickly accepted as the cell's power plants, essential for energy production. Although Claude remained uncertain about the function of microsomes, other researchers like Brachet and Caspersson suggested that they played a role in protein synthesis. This differentiation laid the groundwork for a functional decomposition of the cell into organelles, each contributing uniquely to cellular life. The next steps involved breaking down these organelles further to understand their individual functions and finding organelles associated with other cell functions. These goals drove the research community into the 1950s and 1960s, expanding the understanding of cellular mechanisms.

**Discovering Cell Mechanisms**

The journey to purify the active cancer-causing agent saw remarkable efforts from Albert Claude, who joined Murphy's laboratory after earning his M.D. Claude employed various strategies such as adsorption, precipitation, and dialysis. Although these methods enriched the tumor-producing agent, they did not achieve the desired purification. High-speed centrifugation, inspired by British researchers Ledingham and Gye, became a pivotal technique. This method allowed Claude to isolate a more potent tumor-causing agent, which he characterized chemically, noting the presence of phospholipids and ribonucleic acid. Surprisingly, when centrifuging normal tissues as a control, he discovered similar granules, which led him to shift his focus to normal cells.

Claude initially hypothesized that these granules might be mitochondria, based on their size, shape, and chemical composition. However, further research led him to correct this misidentification, ultimately contributing significantly to the understanding of both granular particles and mitochondria. This shift in focus from cancer to normal cellular components marked a transformation in his research program, which involved reinterpreting his findings within a new conceptual framework. What was once considered a tumor agent became recognized as a crucial cytoplasmic particle, fundamentally altering the approach to cell biology.

**Robert Bensley: An Alternative Approach to Fractionation**

Robert Bensley, a senior investigator at the University of Chicago, offered an alternative approach to fractionation. Unlike Claude, Bensley had been working on mitochondria and cell staining techniques since the early twentieth century. He pioneered the use of centrifugation to separate mitochondria from cells, bridging morphological and chemical analyses. Together with his students, Bensley refined techniques for fixing and staining cells and employed centrifugation to isolate mitochondria from liver tissue. Their research revealed the chemical composition of mitochondria and identified smaller particles that were later found to be similar to those Claude had misidentified as mitochondria.

Bensley's work laid the groundwork for linking cell structure to function, particularly in terms of biochemical reactions. Despite being acknowledged as a founder of modern cytology, Bensley's contributions were eventually overshadowed by Claude and his team at Rockefeller, who established the crucial role of mitochondria in cellular energetics. This link between biochemical function and cytological structure was a significant milestone in the development of cell biology.

**Competing Interpretations of Fractions from Normal Cells**

Claude and Bensley both differentiated two fractions within cells, but their interpretations differed. While Claude initially misidentified small particles as mitochondria, Bensley had already provided more accurate size estimates. Claude developed a method to separate two fractions through successive centrifugation, identifying smaller and larger particles, the latter aligning with Bensley's identification of mitochondria. Despite initial disagreements, both researchers contributed to the understanding of cellular components, paving the way for future discoveries in cell biology.

Ultimately, the Rockefeller laboratory's work, particularly Claude's identification of mitochondria's role in cellular energetics, established a new paradigm in cell biology. This advanced the field by linking biochemical functions to cellular structures, transforming the scientific understanding of cell mechanisms and laying the foundation for future research.
### Discovering Cell Mechanisms

In the early investigations of cell components, Albert Claude made significant strides in understanding the nature of what he initially termed "large granule fraction" and "small particles." Initially, Claude believed that the smaller particles in his cell fractions were mitochondria, while the larger particles corresponded to what Bensley had identified as secretory granules. His chemical analysis of these particles revealed only minor differences; for instance, both contained phospholipids, though the smaller particles had about twice the percentage. They also contained ribose nucleic acids, iron, and copper. Tentatively, Claude adopted a proposal from Noel in 1923, suggesting that the large particles originated from a transformation of the smaller elements, potentially the mitochondria.

During a discussion following Claude's presentation, Jack Schultz introduced an interesting perspective by mentioning the ergastoplasm, a cell constituent from the light microscopy era. Schultz, who had collaborated with Caspersson in the 1930s, had proposed that RNA played a crucial role in protein synthesis. While modern researchers would later link small particles, ergastoplasm, and RNA, Claude was initially skeptical. He argued that the ergastoplasm did not exist and was instead an artifact produced by strong acidic fixatives. This argument was supported by a review from Bowen in 1929, which suggested that ergastoplasm was merely poorly fixed mitochondria.

However, Claude's perspective evolved as he discovered that the small particles were too small to be mitochondria. These particles were invisible under a light microscope, and traditional stains revealed different properties compared to mitochondria. Consequently, Claude reinterpreted his findings, proposing that these small particles represented a previously unrecognized cell component. He suggested naming this new component "microsomes" to distinguish them from known cellular elements. This shift necessitated a reclassification of his "large granule" fraction, which he now believed to be a mixture that included mitochondria and secretory particles, especially prominent in the liver cells of fasting guinea pigs.

To further refine his techniques, Claude employed a different procedure in 1943, centrifuging liver cells from the amphibian Amphiuma tridactylum. By centrifuging at eighteen thousand times the force of gravity, he separated the cell contents into distinguishable layers while keeping them within the cell membrane. Using Bensley's stain, he vividly differentiated secretory granules and mitochondria, which appeared red against a purple background. This method revealed four distinct layers: glycogen, a combination of secretory granules and mitochondria containing nuclei, a "purple substance" identified as microsomes, and the cytosol or true hyloplasm.

Despite his advancements, Claude's interpretations were met with some skepticism. The Bensley group, while appreciative of Claude's contributions, challenged his refusal to identify the large granule fraction primarily as mitochondrial. They argued that his methods did not yield pure preparations but rather mixtures. Further chemical tests in 1944 led Claude to question whether the large granules from guinea pig liver included mitochondria, as they did not stain with Janus green. This prompted him to study leukemic cells from rats, where he concluded that the large granule fraction did consist of true mitochondria, thereby refining the understanding of cellular components and their functions.
