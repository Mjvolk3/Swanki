Chapter 5 - Entering the Terra Incognita between Biochemistry and Cytology

Section: Putting New Research Tools to Work in the 1940s

In the mid-20th century, the landscape of biological research transforms as new techniques from physics and chemistry begin to permeate the boundaries of traditional biology. This convergence bridges the gap between biochemistry, which studies the chemical processes within living organisms, and cytology, the study of cell structure and function. This era sees the advent of powerful tools like cell fractionation and electron microscopy that open up previously uncharted territories within cells. Researchers are no longer confined to what they can observe through light microscopes. Instead, they can now delve into the molecular and micellar organization of protoplasm, the complex substance within the cell.

One of the key breakthroughs during this period is the identification of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum as specific organelles responsible for energy capture and protein synthesis, respectively. This discovery is crucial because it provides a mechanistic understanding of how cells perform essential functions. The 1940s mark the beginning of this journey, and although the term "endoplasmic reticulum" isn't coined until the early 1950s, the groundwork for understanding cellular machinery is being laid. This shift in focus from mere observation to functional analysis marks the dawn of modern cell biology.

At the Rockefeller Institute, a team led by Albert Claude, Keith Porter, and George Palade pioneers this new approach. Their research initially isn't aimed at understanding cell function but evolves to make significant contributions to cell biology. They use cell fractionation methods to separate different cellular components and electron microscopy to visualize them, leading to the identification of various cellular organelles and their functions. This comprehensive approach sets the stage for future discoveries and establishes a new paradigm in biological research.

Section: Linking Claude's Microsomes to Protein Synthesis

Albert Claude's work on microsomes—tiny particulate components he identifies in cell protoplasm—reveals the presence of RNA, a critical molecule in protein synthesis. Although Claude is cautious about assigning a specific function to these particles, his findings pave the way for others to explore the link between RNA and protein synthesis. Jean Brachet and Torbörn Caspersson are two key figures who use new cytochemical tools to establish this connection.

Brachet, while still a medical student, makes significant strides in identifying RNA in growing oocytes. Using the Feulgen reaction, a staining technique for DNA, and ribonuclease treatments, he demonstrates that the intensely red-stained nucleic acid in sea urchin eggs is indeed RNA. This leads him to hypothesize that RNA plays a crucial role in protein synthesis. His collaboration with biochemist Raymond Jeener further reinforces this idea. They isolate particles similar to Claude's microsomes and find that these particles contain almost all cytoplasmic RNA, alongside various enzymes. They speculate that these enzymes could work in reverse, using energy from respiratory enzymes to synthesize peptide bonds, thereby contributing to protein synthesis.

World War II disrupts Brachet's research, but he resumes his work post-war, focusing on RNA metabolism during protein synthesis. Despite facing financial and infrastructural challenges, Brachet and his collaborators make significant contributions to our understanding of RNA's role in protein synthesis. However, their work does not have the same impact as the Rockefeller laboratory's efforts, perhaps because they do not emphasize electron microscopy or the differentiation of cellular fractions representing different functions. This underscores the importance of a broad vision and diverse methodologies in pioneering new scientific fields.

Section: Caspersson: Spectrographic Analysis, RNA, and Protein Synthesis

During the same period, Torbörn Caspersson makes parallel advancements at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Caspersson's background in chemistry and his interest in developing new instruments lead him to create methods for ultraviolet spectrography. By combining a spectroscope and a microscope with a quartz lens, he can measure nucleic acid content in living cells based on their absorption of ultraviolet light. This innovative approach allows Caspersson to quantify nucleic acids and proteins in different cellular regions, providing valuable insights into their roles during cell division and protein synthesis.

Caspersson's work shows that nucleic acids and proteins have distinct absorption spectra under ultraviolet light, enabling him to measure their local concentrations. He discovers that nucleic acid levels peak during cell division, suggesting a link between nucleic acids and gene duplication. However, Caspersson does not initially view DNA as the genetic material; instead, he believes that genes are proteins and that nucleic acids play a supporting role in protein self-replication. His collaboration with Jack Schultz further explores this idea, linking disturbances in nucleic acid metabolism with reproductive anomalies.

Caspersson's research also differentiates the roles of DNA and RNA in protein synthesis. He finds that DNA is necessary for synthesizing proteins in genetic material, while RNA is crucial for cytoplasmic protein synthesis. He observes that the rate of protein synthesis in bacteria correlates linearly with the amount of RNA, reinforcing the interplay between nucleotides and proteins. Despite these significant findings, Caspersson remains vague about RNA's precise role and continues to view proteins as the primary genetic material. His work lays the groundwork for understanding the central role of RNA in protein synthesis, a concept that will become more widely accepted in the following decades.

Section: The War with Several Younger Researchers

In the early 1940s, Holger Hydén, Bo Thorell, and Arne Enström are among the younger researchers engaging in intense scientific debates and collaborations with Torbjörn Caspersson. Caspersson is a pioneering figure whose work intersects with cytochemistry and the development of sophisticated instrumentation for biological research. He is known for his rigorous approach and high standards, which occasionally lead to conflicts and disagreements. Despite these challenges, Caspersson's efforts are instrumental in advancing the understanding of nucleic acids and their role in protein synthesis, albeit with mixed reviews from his peers.

In the mid-1940s, as Caspersson moves into his new laboratory, he significantly expands his research techniques to include electron microscopy and cell fractionation. This period marks a shift in focus, as he begins to delve deeper into the ultrastructure of nerve fibers with the help of electron microscopist Fernández-Morán. Although Caspersson's work during this time does not set the agenda for cell biology, his contributions to the field are nonetheless valuable. His dedication to developing new instruments sometimes overshadows his ability to generate groundbreaking biological insights.

Caspersson's legacy is somewhat paradoxical. While he trains several important junior scientists and contributes to the establishment of new research techniques, his later work is often criticized for lacking significant biological advances. Despite this, his early suggestion that ribonucleic acids are correlated with protein synthesis remains a cornerstone of molecular biology.
Section: Adding a Biochemical Perspective to the Rockefeller Laboratory

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, the Rockefeller Laboratory undergoes significant transformations under the influence of Albert Claude and his expanding team. One of the first new members is Keith Porter, who joins in 1939, followed by George Hogeboom in 1941. Together, they bring a wealth of expertise in cytochemistry and biochemistry, which is pivotal for advancing the laboratory's research. Initially, Hogeboom focuses on chemotherapy studies, investigating substances like tetra-methyl-ortho-phenylene-diamine and rotenone, both known to inhibit oxygen consumption in lymphosarcoma.

Hogeboom's work gradually evolves from cancer research to exploring normal cellular metabolism. One of his significant contributions is the isolation of tyrosine oxidase enzymes from mouse melanoma cells. By using cell fractionation techniques, he and his collaborator, Mark H. Adams, successfully separate two distinct enzymes involved in catalyzing reactions of tyrosine and dihydroxyphenylalanine. Their findings suggest that these enzymes are associated with particulate components of the cell, offering insights into their insolubility after precipitation by ammonium sulfate.

Claude recognizes the necessity of collaborating with biochemists to fully understand the enzyme constitution of his cell fractions. In the early 1940s, he reports on various studies linking cell components with enzymatic activities such as cytochrome oxidase and succinic acid dehydrogenase. These collaborative efforts, including studies with Dean Burk and Rollin Hotchkiss, lay the groundwork for identifying specific enzymes in different cell fractions. This approach marks the beginning of a more systematic investigation into the biochemical activities of cellular components.

Section: Discovering Cell Mechanisms

By the mid-1940s, the Rockefeller Laboratory makes substantial progress in understanding cell mechanisms, thanks to the meticulous work of Claude and his team. One of their key innovations is the adoption of the Warburg manometer to measure the activity of enzymes in different cell fractions. This device allows them to quantify the rate of oxygen consumption, providing a clear metric for enzyme presence and activity. For instance, they use succinic acid salt as a substrate to measure succinic oxidase activity and cytochrome c for cytochrome oxidase activity.

Their experiments reveal that a significant portion of these enzymatic activities is localized in the large granule fraction of the cell, leading to the hypothesis that these granules are associated with mitochondria. This is a crucial step towards the "one enzyme-one fraction" approach, which aims to link specific enzymes exclusively with particular cell fractions. The team meticulously documents their findings, attributing minor enzymatic activities in other fractions to contamination by large granules or their fragments.

The arrival of new investigators like Walter Schneider and George Palade further bolsters the laboratory's capabilities. Schneider brings expertise from one of the top biochemistry departments in the U.S., while Palade's background in physiological research on cellular membranes adds a new dimension to their studies. Together with Hogeboom, they refine the techniques for identifying enzymes within cell fractions, using more sophisticated media like hypertonic sucrose solutions. This allows them to more accurately distinguish mitochondria from other cellular components, solidifying the foundational understanding of cell biology.

Section: First Steps Toward Cell Biology at the Rockefeller Institute

The pioneering efforts in cell biology at the Rockefeller Institute can be traced back to the cancer research laboratory of James Murphy. Murphy's work builds on the foundational research of Peyton Rous, who discovers that a chicken tumor could be transmitted via a filtered extract, suggesting the presence of viral agents. Rous's initial reluctance to focus on cancer research gives way to groundbreaking findings that lay the groundwork for Murphy's subsequent investigations.

Murphy, who takes over the cancer research after Rous shifts his focus, explores the role of lymphocytes in cancer resistance. His studies suggest that the lack of lymphocytes in embryos and brain tissue correlates with a lack of resistance to tumor cells. By the late 1920s, Murphy turns his attention back to the Rous chicken sarcoma, investigating the nature of the tumor-causing agent. His experiments indicate that the agent might have an "enzyme-like nature," furthering the understanding of cancer's underlying mechanisms.

Albert Claude's introduction of cell fractionation at the Rockefeller Institute marks a significant advancement in cell biology. By isolating different cellular components and studying their biochemical activities, Claude and his team uncover crucial insights into cellular respiration and metabolism. Their work establishes the model for modern cell biology, emphasizing the importance of linking specific enzymes to distinct cellular fractions. This approach not only advances scientific knowledge but also sets the standard for future research in the field.

Section: Discovering Cell Mechanisms

Hogeboom and his colleagues revolutionize our understanding of cellular components with their improved fractionation techniques. By breaking down cells into distinct fractions and analyzing their composition, they confirm that mitochondria harbor nearly all the succinoxidase, an enzyme critical for the Krebs cycle. They also discover that the microsome fraction contains about 50 percent of the cellular ribonucleic acid, or RNA. This is groundbreaking because Claude had earlier noted that these small particles were rich in RNA, but their function remained elusive. Despite these findings, Claude remains cautious and does not immediately conclude the role of microsomes, suggesting that their abundance and universal distribution imply a fundamental role in cellular operations, possibly related to protein synthesis or other synthetic reactions.

Claude is skeptical about the established theories that RNA played a role in protein synthesis, mainly because of the separation from oxidative respiration sites. Instead, he hypothesizes that RNA might participate in anaerobic respiration, acting in energy transfer for various synthetic reactions. This idea stems from observed correlations between RNA and fermentation in yeast and certain bacteria. Such insights are crucial at the time, as they hint at the complex roles RNA could play beyond its known functions, thereby opening new avenues for research.

In contrast to his uncertainty about microsomes, Claude is confident about the function of mitochondria. By localizing key oxidative enzymes within mitochondria, he proposes that these organelles are the primary powerhouses of the cell, generating most of the cell's energy. This is a pivotal moment in cell biology, as it links mitochondria directly to energy production, reinforcing their importance in cellular metabolism.

Section: Adding Electron Microscopy as a Tool

In the early 1940s, Claude takes advantage of the electron microscope at Interchemical Corporation, which provides unprecedented insights into cellular structures. The electron microscope allows Claude to observe large and small granules produced by his fractionation method. The larger particles from liver cells and mitochondria from leukemic cells appear as opaque spheres under the microscope.
Section: Advancements in Electron Microscopy and Cellular Organization

In the early 1940s, Albert Claude utilizes the electron microscope at Interchemical Corporation to gain unprecedented insights into cellular structures. The electron microscope allows Claude to observe both large and small granules produced by his fractionation method. Larger particles from liver cells and mitochondria from leukemic cells appear as opaque spheres under the microscope. While intact mitochondria are too thick to reveal much detail, damaged ones allow some internal structures to be seen. These observations suggest a relationship between large granules and smaller microsomes, hinting at a more complex internal organization within cells.

Claude's initial use of electron microscopy does not yield comprehensive information about mitochondria or microsomes. However, Keith Porter, who joins Claude's lab in 1939, proposes using tissue-cultured cells to produce thinner specimens for electron microscopy. This approach results in a detailed image of a fibroblast-like cell and nerve fibers from chick embryo tissue, revealing the intricate structures within the cytoplasm. The comparison between electron micrographs and light microscope images highlights the superior detail provided by electron microscopy, showcasing features like filamentous mitochondria, Golgi bodies, and a delicate lace-like network throughout the cytoplasm.

Porter's skills in micromanipulation and his innovative use of electron microscopy lead to significant discoveries. For instance, he and Claude observe that mitochondria appear as elongated structures with areas of increased density and small granules, suggesting these might be composed of inorganic salts or centers of reduced osmium accumulation. These observations challenge earlier interpretations of cellular structures, such as the Golgi apparatus, and open new research avenues. Over time, Porter and Claude's work reveals that the cytoplasmic ground substance, or spongioplasm, might be particulate in nature, further complicating our understanding of cellular organization.

Section: Insights into Cancer Research through Electron Microscopy

Claude and Porter’s electron microscopy work paves the way for new insights into cancer research. They find that tumor cells contain small, dense granules not commonly seen in normal cells. These granules are identified in different tumor types, leading to the hypothesis that they might be the causative agents of the tumors. By studying Chicken Tumor 1 and Chicken Tumor 10 cells, they note the distribution and density of these granules, concluding that they possibly replicate by division and vary in size as they grow and split.

After these joint investigations, Claude and Porter focus on different aspects of cellular research. Claude works on techniques for thinly sectioning cells, while Porter explores the structure and function of cultured cells. In particular, Porter’s work on the lace-like reticulum in the cytoplasm suggests a complex endoplasmic network, which is previously unobservable. This network appears to be highly active, and its vesicular structure hints at secretory functions. Porter proposes that this endoplasm might be crucial in determining the structural and functional organization of cells, particularly in egg cells.

Porter's observations indicate that the endoplasm comprises a fibrillar apparatus concentrated around the cell's central body and extending throughout the cell. This suggests that the endoplasm is integral to cellular activity and structure, influencing processes such as secretion and possibly even determining the cell's developmental fate. These findings are significant because they provide a deeper understanding of the cytoplasmic structures and their roles, bridging the gap between biochemistry and cytology and advancing our knowledge of cellular mechanisms.

Section: Studies of Cancer Cells in the Mid-1940s

In the mid-1940s, significant strides are made in the study of cancer cells by researchers such as Keith Porter and Helen Thompson. Their initial work involves examining cultured cells from rat sarcomas, a type of cancerous tumor, where they note a higher density of endoplasmic granules on shorter strands within the cells. This suggests an unusual cellular structure in cancer cells that is different from normal cells. Another pivotal study is conducted on mammary carcinoma in mice. John Bittner had previously discovered that this type of cancer could be transmitted through the mother's milk. Porter and Thompson utilize electron microscopy to investigate mammary gland tumor cells cultured from mice. They identify distinct particles within these cells, measuring around 130 millimicrons in diameter, with a well-defined central core. They tentatively propose that these particles could be the viral agents responsible for cancer transmission through milk, although their evidence is circumstantial at the time.

Section: State of Cell Studies at the End of the 1940s

By the end of the 1940s, the research landscape at Rockefeller undergoes significant changes, with a broader focus on varied laboratories. Albert Claude's research is instrumental during this period. Initially, he aims to understand the constitution of normal cells, having recognized that particles of the same size exist in both normal cells and tumor-causing fractions from Rous sarcoma cells. Claude's primary tool is cell fractionation, a process that allows him to separate different cellular components. Through this methodology, he identifies two fractions of cytoplasmic particles and a nuclear fraction, along with a supernatant. Eventually, he concludes that the larger particles are primarily mitochondria, while the smaller ones are a new cellular component he names microsomes. These findings are refined over the decade, especially through collaboration with Porter, using electron microscopy to observe whole cells in tissue culture. This leads to the identification of both mitochondria and a lace-like reticulum, which is related to the microsomes isolated earlier.

The emerging view of the cytoplasm is that it comprises mitochondria, the lace-like reticulum or microsomes, and a gel-like aqueous component known as the cytosol or cell sap. These structures are associated with distinct cellular activities. Mitochondria are quickly accepted as the cell's power plants, essential for energy production. Although Claude remains uncertain about the function of microsomes, other researchers like Brachet and Caspersson suggest that they play a role in protein synthesis. This differentiation lays the groundwork for a functional decomposition of the cell into organelles, each contributing uniquely to cellular life. The next steps involve breaking down these organelles further to understand their individual functions and finding organelles associated with other cell functions. These goals drive the research community into the 1950s and 1960s, expanding the understanding of cellular mechanisms.

Section: Efforts to Purify the Cancer-Causing Agent

The journey to purify the active cancer-causing agent sees remarkable efforts from Albert Claude, who joins Murphy's laboratory after earning his M.D. Claude employs various strategies such as adsorption, precipitation, and dialysis. Although these methods enrich the tumor-producing agent, they do not achieve the desired purification. High-speed centrifugation, inspired by British researchers Ledingham and Gye, becomes a pivotal technique. This method allows Claude to isolate a more potent tumor-causing agent, which he characterizes chemically, noting the presence of phospholipids and ribonucleic acid. Surprisingly, when centrifuging normal tissues as a control, he discovers similar granules, which leads him to shift his focus to normal cells.
Section: Transition from Cancer Research to Normal Cellular Components

Albert Claude's initial work focused on identifying cancer-causing agents, but further research led him to correct earlier misidentifications, ultimately contributing significantly to the understanding of both granular particles and mitochondria. This shift in focus from cancer to normal cellular components marked a transformation in his research program. He reinterpreted his findings within a new conceptual framework, recognizing that what was once considered a tumor agent was actually a crucial cytoplasmic particle. This fundamentally altered the approach to cell biology, emphasizing the importance of normal cellular components.

Section: Robert Bensley's Alternative Approach to Fractionation

Robert Bensley, a senior investigator at the University of Chicago, offered an alternative approach to fractionation. Unlike Claude, Bensley had been working on mitochondria and cell staining techniques since the early twentieth century. He pioneered the use of centrifugation to separate mitochondria from cells, bridging morphological and chemical analyses. Together with his students, Bensley refined techniques for fixing and staining cells and employed centrifugation to isolate mitochondria from liver tissue. Their research revealed the chemical composition of mitochondria and identified smaller particles that were later found to be similar to those Claude had misidentified as mitochondria.

Bensley's work laid the groundwork for linking cell structure to function, particularly in terms of biochemical reactions. Despite being acknowledged as a founder of modern cytology, Bensley's contributions were eventually overshadowed by Claude and his team at Rockefeller, who established the crucial role of mitochondria in cellular energetics. This link between biochemical function and cytological structure was a significant milestone in the development of cell biology.

Section: Competing Interpretations of Fractions from Normal Cells

Claude and Bensley both differentiated two fractions within cells, but their interpretations differed. While Claude initially misidentified small particles as mitochondria, Bensley had already provided more accurate size estimates. Claude developed a method to separate two fractions through successive centrifugation, identifying smaller and larger particles, the latter aligning with Bensley's identification of mitochondria. Despite initial disagreements, both researchers contributed to the understanding of cellular components, paving the way for future discoveries in cell biology.

Ultimately, the Rockefeller laboratory's work, particularly Claude's identification of mitochondria's role in cellular energetics, established a new paradigm in cell biology. This advanced the field by linking biochemical functions to cellular structures, transforming the scientific understanding of cell mechanisms and laying the foundation for future research.

Section: Refinement of Cell Fractionation Techniques

In the early investigations of cell components, Albert Claude made significant strides in understanding the nature of what he initially termed "large granule fraction" and "small particles." Initially, Claude believed that the smaller particles in his cell fractions were mitochondria, while the larger particles corresponded to what Bensley had identified as secretory granules. His chemical analysis of these particles revealed only minor differences; for instance, both contained phospholipids, though the smaller particles had about twice the percentage. They also contained ribonucleic acids, iron, and copper. Tentatively, Claude adopted a proposal from Noel in 1923, suggesting that the large particles originated from a transformation of the smaller elements, potentially the mitochondria.

During a discussion following Claude's presentation, Jack Schultz introduced an interesting perspective by mentioning the ergastoplasm, a cell constituent from the light microscopy era. Schultz, who had collaborated with Torbörn Caspersson in the 1930s, had proposed that RNA played a crucial role in protein synthesis. While modern researchers would later link small particles, ergastoplasm, and RNA, Claude was initially skeptical. He argued that the ergastoplasm did not exist and was instead an artifact produced by strong acidic fixatives. This argument was supported by a review from Bowen in 1929, which suggested that ergastoplasm was merely poorly fixed mitochondria.

However, Claude's perspective evolved as he discovered that the small particles were too small to be mitochondria. These particles were invisible under a light microscope, and traditional stains revealed different properties compared to mitochondria. Consequently, Claude reinterpreted his findings, proposing that these small particles represented a previously unrecognized cell component. He suggested naming this new component "microsomes" to distinguish them from known cellular elements. This shift necessitated a reclassification of his "large granule" fraction, which he now believed to be a mixture that included mitochondria and secretory particles, especially prominent in the liver cells of fasting guinea pigs.

Section: Advanced Centrifugation Techniques and Microsome Identification

To further refine his techniques, Claude employed a different procedure in 1943, centrifuging liver cells from the amphibian Amphiuma tridactylum. By centrifuging at eighteen thousand times the force of gravity, he separated the cell contents into distinguishable layers while keeping them within the cell membrane. Using Bensley's stain, he vividly differentiated secretory granules and mitochondria, which appeared red against a purple background. This method revealed four distinct layers: glycogen, a combination of secretory granules and mitochondria containing nuclei, a "purple substance" identified as microsomes, and the cytosol or true hyloplasm.

Despite his advancements, Claude's interpretations were met with some skepticism. The Bensley group, while appreciative of Claude's contributions, challenged his refusal to identify the large granule fraction primarily as mitochondrial. They argued that his methods did not yield pure preparations but rather mixtures. Further chemical tests in 1944 led Claude to question whether the large granules from guinea pig liver included mitochondria, as they did not stain with Janus green. This prompted him to study leukemic cells from rats, where he concluded that the large granule fraction did consist of true mitochondria, thereby refining the understanding of cellular components and their functions.
