## Explain the relationship between testosterone and vasculogenesis in the urethra.

Testosterone mediates vasculogenesis in the urethra through the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-1 $\alpha$ (HIF-1 $\alpha$) pathways.

## What effect does testosterone deficiency (TD) have on urethral vascularity and how can it be counteracted?

Testosterone deficiency (TD) impairs cytokine expression and homing of stem cells that induce neovascularization, resulting in reduced urethral vascularity. Androgen supplementation, or testosterone replacement, can restore neovascularization.

## {{c1::Testosterone deficiency is common in men with urethral strictures.}}

## Describe the role of androgens in the regulation of ischemia-induced angiogenesis.

Androgens regulate ischemia-induced angiogenesis by modulating the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-1 $\alpha$ (HIF-1 $\alpha$), which promote neovascularization and cytokine expression.

## What are the theoretical advantages of preoperative testosterone in hypospadias surgery?

Preoperative testosterone theoretically offers several advantages in hypospadias surgery, including increased penile and glanular size and improved prepucial vascularity, potentially leading to better wound healing and surgical outcomes.

## In the context of the study by Hofer et al., define Testosterone Deficiency (TD).

Testosterone Deficiency (TD) is defined as serum testosterone levels less than $280 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{dL}$.

## What was the association between testosterone deficiency (TD) and AUS erosion found by Hofer et al.?

Hofer et al. found that 90% of men with AUS erosion had testosterone deficiency (TD). The multivariate analysis showed that TD was independently associated with AUS erosion.

## Consider the study findings about serum testosterone levels and urethral erosion. What was the odds ratio of urethral erosion in men with testosterone deficiency?

The odds ratio (OR) of urethral erosion in men with testosterone deficiency was found to be 2.519 with a $p$-value of 0.021.

$$ \text{OR} = 2.519, \, p = 0.021 $$

## According to Hofer et al.'s study on androgen mediated vascularity, what were the angiopoietin-1 receptor (TIE-2) expression levels in men with low serum testosterone compared to normal levels?

The angiopoietin-1 receptor (TIE-2) expression levels in men with low serum testosterone were found to be $1.84 \%$ HPF versus $3.08 \%$ HPF in men with normal serum testosterone levels.

$$1.84\% \, \text{HPF vs} \, 3.08\% \, \text{HPF} \, (p = 0.006)$$

## Discuss the relation between serum testosterone levels and stricture length as found by Spencer et al.

Spencer et al. found that men with low serum testosterone levels had significantly longer stricture lengths compared to men with normal serum testosterone levels. Specifically, the average stricture length was $7.2 \mathrm{~cm}$ versus $4.8 \mathrm{~cm}$ with $p=0.02$.

$$ 7.2 \, \text{cm vs} \, 4.8 \, \text{cm} \, (p = 0.02) $$

## What were the significant findings regarding serum testosterone levels in men with urethral stricture disease compared to controls?

Mean serum testosterone levels were significantly lower in men with urethral strictures ($391$ ng/dL vs $495$ ng/dL, $p < 0.01$) although the mean was above $300$ ng/dL in both groups. Men with urethral stricture disease also had a significantly higher incidence of serum testosterone < $300$ ng/dL (35.8% vs 14.6%, $p < 0.007$; OR $3.2$, CI $1.27-8.33$).

## Can you describe the hormonal differences found in men with urethral stricture disease compared to controls?

Men with urethral stricture disease had significantly higher levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The values were $10.7$ mIU/mL vs $5.01$ mIU/mL for FSH and $6.2$ mIU/mL vs $4.2$ mIU/mL for LH, both with $p < 0.01$.

## What was the impact of testosterone supplementation on periurethral vascularity in Yura and colleagues' rat model?

Testosterone supplementation restored periurethral vascularity in castrated rats. CD31, AR, and TIE-2 expression increased significantly with testosterone supplementation, surpassing levels observed in the non-castrate control group.

- #medicine, #urology.testosterone-effects

## What relationship did postoperative CD31 expression have with TIE-2 and AR in rats that received testosterone supplementation?

Postoperative CD31 expression was correlated with TIE-2 ($r = 0.454, p < 0.001$) and AR ($r = 0.561, p < 0.001$) expression, suggesting a mechanistic relationship in the rats that received testosterone supplementation post-urethroplasty.

## What future directions are suggested for understanding the role of testosterone in urethral stricture disease?

Further research is needed to understand:

1. The direct pathogenesis between low serum testosterone and urethral strictures.
2. The impact of testosterone deficiency on surgical outcomes.
3. Whether testosterone supplementation can protect against urethral stricture disease and improve wound healing post-operatively.

## What is the association between testosterone deficiency (TD) and artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) erosion according to Hofer et al. [18]?

Hofer et al. [18] found that AUS erosion is independently associated with testosterone deficiency (TD). Specifically, $90\%$ of men with AUS erosion had TD.

## What was the main finding of Wolfe et al. [19] regarding AUS erosion and TD?

Wolfe et al. [19] found that TD is associated with AUS erosion on multivariate analysis. The odds ratio (OR) for AUS erosion with TD was $ \mathrm{OR}=2.519$.

## How did Bonilla et al. [26] connect testosterone deficiency (TD) with urethral stricture prevalence?

According to Bonilla et al. [26], TD was more common in men with urethral stricture, with a prevalence of $35.8\%$ compared to $14.5\%$. They also found higher levels of FSH ($\mathrm{FSH} = 10.7$ vs $\mathrm{5.01 \mathrm{mIU} / \mathrm{mL}, p<0.01}$) and LH ($\mathrm{LH}=6.2$ vs $4.2 \mathrm{mIU} / \mathrm{mL}, p<0.01)$ in stricture patients.
