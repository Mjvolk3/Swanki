**Review: Testosterone, Urethral Vascularity, and Urethral Stricture Disease**

**Introduction**

Urethral stricture disease is an ancient urologic condition, first documented in ancient India around the sixth century BC. The treatment back then involved using a reed catheter for dilation. Despite its long history, a significant portion of urethral strictures still have an unclear etiology. Common causes include medical interventions, infections, trauma, and specific diseases like lichen sclerosus. However, in developed countries, up to 41% of these strictures are idiopathic, meaning their cause is unknown. Some idiopathic cases might be due to unnoticed perineal trauma, but much remains to be understood about their origins. Iatrogenic causes, such as catheterization, hypospadias surgery, or prostate cancer treatments, often result in ischemic injuries to the urethra, leading to stricture formation.

A key player in wound healing after ischemic injury is angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. Androgens, including testosterone, regulate this process through pathways involving vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha). Studies in animal models have shown that testosterone deficiency impairs the expression of cytokines and the homing of stem cells necessary for new blood vessel formation in cardiac tissues after ischemic damage. Testosterone replacement can restore this neovascularization. The role of sex hormones in urethral disorders, like hypospadias and now urethral strictures, has been long considered. Testosterone exposure in utero has been shown to result in more robust urethral tissues, whereas estrogen exposure leads to arrested development. The use of preoperative testosterone before hypospadias surgery was first explored in 1971, with theoretical benefits including increased tissue quality and vascularity, potentially improving surgical outcomes.

As our understanding of testosterone's role in urethral development and angiogenesis has grown, interest has extended beyond hypospadias to other urethral pathologies, including urethral stricture disease. This review aims to discuss several key areas: the role of testosterone in urethral vascularity, the relationship between testosterone deficiency and urethral stricture disease, the effects of testosterone supplementation on urethral vascularity, and future directions in this emerging field.

**Testosterone and AUS Urethral Erosion**

Recent years have seen growing interest in the relationship between testosterone and adult urethral pathologies. A pivotal study evaluated testosterone and urethral erosion following the placement of an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS). Researchers observed an increased incidence of AUS erosions in men with testosterone deficiency, defined as serum testosterone levels below 280 nanograms per deciliter. In a study of 53 patients, 20 had AUS erosion, and 18 of these had testosterone deficiency. Only 9% of men with normal testosterone levels experienced erosion. Multivariate analysis confirmed that testosterone deficiency was independently associated with AUS erosion, while prior radiation therapy, despite being more common in patients with erosion, was not an independent risk factor.

A larger retrospective review involving 161 men who underwent AUS surgery revealed that low serum testosterone levels were more common in those with urethral erosion. The analysis showed that men with testosterone deficiency were more likely to experience erosion, with an odds ratio of approximately 2.5. This study reinforced the idea that testosterone deficiency might be a significant risk factor for urethral erosion, independent of other known risk factors like pelvic radiation therapy and prior urethral reconstruction, both of which impact periurethral vascularity.

The potential for testosterone to mediate angiogenesis, or the formation of new blood vessels, in the context of urethral health sparked further investigations. Compromised urethral vascularity appears to be a critical factor in the risk of urethral sub-cuff atrophy and erosion, suggesting a possible mechanistic link between testosterone levels and urethral health.

**Testosterone and Urethral Vascularity**

Following the initial findings on testosterone and urethral erosion, researchers delved deeper into the role of testosterone in mediating urethral vascularity. One study compared androgen receptor expression, its downstream target angiopoietin-1 receptor (TIE-2), and the overall vascularity in urethral stricture tissues from men with normal versus low serum testosterone levels. The study involved 11 men who had their serum testosterone levels measured within two years of undergoing urethroplasty. Results showed decreased expression of androgen receptors, TIE-2, and overall vessel count in men with low serum testosterone levels.

Despite the study's limitations, including a small sample size and potential selection bias, the findings suggested a mechanistic model where low serum testosterone leads to decreased urethral and corpus spongiosum vasculogenesis through androgen receptor and TIE-2 pathways. This model proposed that testosterone deficiency might impair the formation of new blood vessels in urethral tissues, potentially contributing to the development of urethral strictures.

Further studies explored pathological markers in urethral stricture tissues, comparing those with lichen sclerosus (LS) to non-LS patients. Researchers found alterations in androgen receptor expression in a significant portion of strictures, with no difference between LS and non-LS strictures. Interestingly, two-thirds of strictures expressed high levels of VEGF, a marker for angiogenesis. Although the study did not assess serum testosterone levels, the findings added to the growing body of evidence linking androgen receptor alterations to urethral stricture disease.

**Testosterone Deficiency and Urethral Stricture Disease**

A retrospective review of patients undergoing urethroplasty revealed a high incidence of testosterone deficiency among men with urethral stricture disease. The study included 157 patients, of whom 115 had preoperative testosterone assessments. Results showed that 56.5% of these men had testosterone deficiency, defined as serum testosterone levels below 300 nanograms per deciliter. Higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with lower testosterone levels, and men with low testosterone had significantly longer strictures compared to those with normal testosterone levels.

The study compared these findings to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which included testosterone levels for a large sample of men. The comparison revealed that the prevalence of low testosterone was higher among men with urethral stricture disease than in the general population. This suggested a potential link between testosterone deficiency and the severity of urethral strictures.

Another study compared serum testosterone levels in men with urethral stricture disease to those presenting with non-voiding related complaints. Results showed significantly lower testosterone levels in men with urethral strictures and higher levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. These findings further supported the idea that testosterone deficiency might be more common in men with urethral stricture disease, although the exact role of serum testosterone in stricture pathogenesis remains unclear.

**Testosterone Supplementation and Urethral Vascularity**

As evidence linking low serum testosterone to urethral vascularity grew, researchers investigated whether hormone supplementation could improve urethral vascularity. Initial studies in rat models showed promising results. In one study, castrated rats with testosterone supplementation exhibited increased vessel count, androgen receptor, and TIE-2 expression compared to castrated rats without supplementation. These findings demonstrated that testosterone supplementation could restore periurethral vascularity.

Further research assessed the impact of hormone supplementation on urethral tissue following urethroplasty in rats. Results showed that postoperative angiogenesis, as indicated by increased CD31 expression, was improved with testosterone supplementation. The study suggested a mechanistic relationship between androgen receptor and TIE-2 expression and postoperative vascularity. These findings indicated that testosterone supplementation could enhance urethral vascularity even in a perioperative setting.

The work suggested that testosterone supplementation might improve urethral vascularity and postoperative angiogenesis, potentially leading to better surgical outcomes. However, it remained unclear how these findings would translate to human patients, particularly those with urethral pathology. The comparison group in these studies was castrated rats, raising questions about the applicability of the results to individuals with less severe testosterone deficiency.

**Future Directions**

Despite significant progress in understanding the impact of testosterone on urethral vascularity and stricture disease, several questions remain. Researchers need to clarify the role of testosterone in the etiology of urethral strictures. Is there a direct pathogenesis where low serum testosterone creates an ischemic environment leading to urethral strictures? What portion of idiopathic urethral strictures are due to testosterone deficiency? Does testosterone deficiency hinder wound healing following trauma or medical interventions, and could testosterone supplementation offer protective benefits?

Another area of interest is the potential impact of testosterone deficiency on surgical outcomes. Improving urethral vascularity through hormone supplementation might reduce stricture recurrence and enhance wound healing. Additionally, addressing the vascular side effects of urethroplasty, particularly sexual side effects, remains a crucial area of research. The debate over transecting versus non-transecting anastomotic urethroplasty highlights the need for further exploration into how surgical techniques and testosterone levels influence long-term outcomes.

In conclusion, while much has been learned about the relationship between testosterone, urethral vascularity, and stricture disease, ongoing research is essential to fully understand these connections and translate findings into clinical practice.
### Benefits of Preserving the Antegrade Blood Supply to the Corpus Spongiosum

The antegrade blood supply to the corpus spongiosum plays a crucial role in maintaining its health and function. The corpus spongiosum is a spongy tissue surrounding the male urethra and is vital for normal urination and erectile function. Preserving this blood supply ensures that the tissue remains well-oxygenated and nourished, which is essential for healing and maintaining tissue integrity, especially during surgical procedures such as urethroplasty.

A recent randomized controlled trial compared two surgical techniques for urethroplasty: excision and primary anastomosis (EPA) versus buccal mucosa graft urethroplasty. The findings indicated that the EPA group experienced a higher rate of reduced glans filling. This suggests that preserving the antegrade blood supply might be more challenging with EPA, leading to poorer outcomes in terms of glans filling. As we continue to explore the impact of testosterone on urethroplasty outcomes, it’s possible that testosterone supplementation could improve vascularity and healing, potentially altering both outcomes and surgical approaches.

### Summary of Studies Evaluating Testosterone and Urethral Vascularity

A summary of studies evaluating the relationship between testosterone and urethral vascularity highlights several critical findings. For instance, multiple studies have found that testosterone deficiency, defined as serum testosterone below 280 nanograms per deciliter, is associated with adverse outcomes like artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) erosion and longer urethral strictures. Hofer et al. and Wolfe et al. both reported that testosterone deficiency independently increases the risk of AUS erosion. 

Additionally, studies by Hofer et al. and Levy et al. noted decreased androgen receptor (AR) expression in urethral stricture tissues from men with testosterone deficiency, which is associated with poorer vascularization. This reduced vascularity can contribute to the formation and persistence of strictures. Animal studies, such as those by Yura et al., have shown that testosterone supplementation can improve AR and CD31 expression, a marker for blood vessel formation. These findings underscore the potential role of testosterone in enhancing urethral vascularity and improving surgical outcomes in urethral stricture patients.

### Conclusions

In conclusion, the vascularity within the urethra and corpus spongiosum is intricately mediated through androgen pathways. A significant number of men suffering from urethral stricture disease also exhibit testosterone deficiency. Animal model studies indicate that testosterone supplementation can significantly improve urethral vascularity. As research in this area progresses, it may lead to better understanding of urethral stricture etiologies and the impact of testosterone on surgical outcomes. This could eventually inform new approaches and treatments for patients undergoing urethral reconstruction.
