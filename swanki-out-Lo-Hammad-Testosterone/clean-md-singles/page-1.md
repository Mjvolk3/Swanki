\begin{abstract}
Urethral stricture disease is one of the oldest described urologic pathologies and urethroplasty is associated with high success rates Many urethral strictures are thought to arise from iatrogenic injury or radiation therapy which can create ischemic insults to the urethra In developed countries, most urethral strictures are idiopathic; therefore, much is still unknown about the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease. Testosterone is known to mediate vasculogenesis through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-1 $\alpha$ (HIF-1 $\alpha$ ) pathways in various organs. Recently, testosterone has been shown to mediate urethral vasculogenesis. In the setting of testosterone deficiency, androgen supplementation can improve urethral vascularity. Further, there appears to be a high incidence of testosterone deficiency in men with urethral strictures. Despite many advances in our understanding of testosterone's association with the urethra over the past few years, there remains much to be learned about the mechanism of testosterone on urethral stricture etiology and whether testosterone deficiency and supplementation impact urethral reconstruction outcomes.

\section*{1. Introduction}

Urethral stricture disease was described as early as the sixth century BC in ancient India and was treated with dilation from a reed catheter at that time [1]. Although it is one of the oldest described pathologies in urology and medicine, the etiology remains poorly understood in a significant number of patients. The most common etiologies for anterior urethral strictures are iatrogenic, infectious, traumatic, and lichen sclerosus (LS) disease (formerly known as balanitis xerotica obliterans). In developed countries, an idiopathic or unknown etiology accounts for $34 \%-41 \%$ of anterior urethral strictures [2-5]. Some idiopathic strictures may be the result of unrecognized perineal trauma; however, a lot remains poorly understood about the etiology of many strictures. Iatrogenic strictures are typically the result of transurethral instrumentation/catheterization, hypospadias surgery, or prostate cancer treatment. These insults typically result in an ischemic injury to the urethra leading to stricture formation.

Angiogenesis mediates wound healing following an ischemic insult. Multiple models have demonstrated the role of androgens in the regulation of ischemia induced angiogenesis $[6,7]$. Androgens have been shown to modulate angiogenesis through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-1 $\alpha$ (HIF-1 $\alpha$ ) pathways [7]. In animal models, testosterone deficiency (TD) impairs cytokine expression and homing of the stem cells that induce neovascularization within cardiac tissue following ischemic damage from myocardial infarction [8]. Further, it was suggested that testosterone replacement could restore neovascularization in TD mice [8].
Sex hormones have long been considered in the pathogenesis and treatment of urethral disorders, namely hypospadias. Exposure to estrogens has been shown to result in arrested urethral development. Alternatively, testosterone exposure to male mice in utero resulted in a more robust peri-urethral spongiosal tissue [9]. Androgen stimulation prior to hypospadias surgery was first used in 1971 [10]. Preoperative testosterone has several theoretical advantages including increased penile and glanular size as well as an increase in prepucial vascularity [11-15]. Theoretically, improved tissue quality and vascularity would result in better wound healing and outcomes. Results of hormonal stimulation on hypospadias outcomes are conflicting [16,17] and the use of preoperative testosterone remains controversial.

As the understanding of the role of testosterone in urethral development and angiogenesis has grown, it has spurred an interest beyond hypospadias and into other urethral pathologies including urethral stricture disease. The objectives of this review are to discuss the roles of (1) testosterone in urethral vascularity, (2) TD and urethral stricture disease, (3) testosterone supplementation on urethral vascularity, and (4) future directions of testosterone and stricture disease

\section*{2. Testosterone and AUS Urethral Erosion}

Over the last several years there has been a growing interest in testosterone and adult urethral pathologies. The first series that spurred this interest evaluated testosterone and urethral erosion following artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) placement [18]. The authors had noticed an increase
