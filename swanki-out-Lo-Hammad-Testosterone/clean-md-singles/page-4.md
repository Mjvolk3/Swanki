*TD defined by serum testosterone $<280 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{dL}$; TD, testosterone deficiency; AUS, artificial urinary sphincter; FSH, follicle stimulating hormone; $\mathrm{LH}$, luteinizing hormone.

ized controlled trial comparing excision and primary anastomosis (EPA) and buccal mucosa graft urethroplasty found a higher rate of reduced glans filling in the EPA group [29]. As we learn more about the impact of testosterone on urethroplasty outcomes, it will be interesting to see if testosterone not only changes outcomes but also approaches to urethral reconstruction.

\section*{7. Conclusions}

Vascularity within the urethra and corpus spongiosum is mediated through androgen pathways. Further, it appears a large number of men with urethral stricture disease have TD. Supplementation with testosterone appears to improve urethral vascularity within animal models. As this area of study continues to emerge, we will hopefully learn more about urethral stricture etiologies and the impact of testosterone on surgical outcomes.
