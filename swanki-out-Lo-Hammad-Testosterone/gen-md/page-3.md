## What were the significant findings regarding serum testosterone levels in men with urethral stricture disease compared to controls?

Mean serum testosterone levels were significantly lower in men with urethral strictures ($391$ ng/dL vs $495$ ng/dL, $p < 0.01$) although the mean was above $300$ ng/dL in both groups. Men with urethral stricture disease also had a significantly higher incidence of serum testosterone < $300$ ng/dL (35.8% vs 14.6%, $p < 0.007$; OR $3.2$, CI $1.27-8.33$).

## Can you describe the hormonal differences found in men with urethral stricture disease compared to controls?

Men with urethral stricture disease had significantly higher levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The values were $10.7$ mIU/mL vs $5.01$ mIU/mL for FSH and $6.2$ mIU/mL vs $4.2$ mIU/mL for LH, both with $p < 0.01$.

## What was the impact of testosterone supplementation on periurethral vascularity in Yura and colleagues' rat model?

Testosterone supplementation restored periurethral vascularity in castrated rats. CD31, AR, and TIE-2 expression increased significantly with testosterone supplementation, surpassing levels observed in the non-castrate control group.

## What relationship did postoperative CD31 expression have with TIE-2 and AR in rats that received testosterone supplementation?

Postoperative CD31 expression was correlated with TIE-2 ($r = 0.454, p < 0.001$) and AR ($r = 0.561, p < 0.001$) expression, suggesting a mechanistic relationship in the rats that received testosterone supplementation post-urethroplasty.

## What future directions are suggested for understanding the role of testosterone in urethral stricture disease?

Further research is needed to understand:

1. The direct pathogenesis between low serum testosterone and urethral strictures.
2. The impact of testosterone deficiency on surgical outcomes.
3. Whether testosterone supplementation can protect against urethral stricture disease and improve wound healing post-operatively.
