## What is the association between testosterone deficiency (TD) and artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) erosion according to Hofer et al. [18]?

Hofer et al. [18] found that AUS erosion is independently associated with testosterone deficiency (TD). Specifically, $90\%$ of men with AUS erosion had TD.

## What was the main finding of Wolfe et al. [19] regarding AUS erosion and TD?

Wolfe et al. [19] found that TD is associated with AUS erosion on multivariate analysis. The odds ratio (OR) for AUS erosion with TD was $ \mathrm{OR}=2.519$.

## What was found about AR expression and VEGF in Levy et al. [24]?

Levy et al. [24] observed AR loss in $43\%$ of all strictures and upregulated VEGF in $66\%$ of strictures.

## How did Bonilla et al. [26] connect testosterone deficiency (TD) with urethral stricture prevalence?

According to Bonilla et al. [26], TD was more common in men with urethral stricture, with a prevalence of $35.8\%$ compared to $14.5\%$. They also found higher levels of FSH ($\mathrm{FSH} = 10.7$ vs $\mathrm{5.01 \mathrm{mIU} / \mathrm{mL}, p<0.01}$) and LH ($\mathrm{LH}=6.2$ vs $4.2 \mathrm{mIU} / \mathrm{mL}, p<0.01)$ in stricture patients.
