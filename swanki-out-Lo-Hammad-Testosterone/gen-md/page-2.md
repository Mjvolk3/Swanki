## In the context of the study by Hofer et al., define Testosterone Deficiency (TD).

Testosterone Deficiency (TD) is defined as serum testosterone levels less than $280 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{dL}$.

## What was the association between testosterone deficiency (TD) and AUS erosion found by Hofer et al.?

Hofer et al. found that 90% of men with AUS erosion had testosterone deficiency (TD). The multivariate analysis showed that TD was independently associated with AUS erosion.

## Consider the study findings about serum testosterone levels and urethral erosion. What was the odds ratio of urethral erosion in men with testosterone deficiency?

The odds ratio (OR) of urethral erosion in men with testosterone deficiency was found to be 2.519 with a $p$-value of 0.021.

$$ \text{OR} = 2.519, \, p = 0.021 $$

## According to Hofer et al.'s study on androgen mediated vascularity, what were the angiopoietin-1 receptor (TIE-2) expression levels in men with low serum testosterone compared to normal levels?

The angiopoietin-1 receptor (TIE-2) expression levels in men with low serum testosterone were found to be $1.84 \%$ HPF versus $3.08 \%$ HPF in men with normal serum testosterone levels.

$$1.84\% \, \text{HPF vs} \, 3.08\% \, \text{HPF} \, (p = 0.006)$$

## Discuss the relation between serum testosterone levels and stricture length as found by Spencer et al.

Spencer et al. found that men with low serum testosterone levels had significantly longer stricture lengths compared to men with normal serum testosterone levels. Specifically, the average stricture length was $7.2 \mathrm{~cm}$ versus $4.8 \mathrm{~cm}$ with $p=0.02$.

$$ 7.2 \, \text{cm vs} \, 4.8 \, \text{cm} \, (p = 0.02) $$
