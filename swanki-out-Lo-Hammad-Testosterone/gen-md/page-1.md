## Explain the relationship between testosterone and vasculogenesis in the urethra.

Testosterone mediates vasculogenesis in the urethra through the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-1 $\alpha$ (HIF-1 $\alpha$) pathways.

## What effect does testosterone deficiency (TD) have on urethral vascularity and how can it be counteracted?

Testosterone deficiency (TD) impairs cytokine expression and homing of stem cells that induce neovascularization, resulting in reduced urethral vascularity. Androgen supplementation, or testosterone replacement, can restore neovascularization.

## {{c1::Testosterone deficiency is common in men with urethral strictures.}}

## Describe the role of androgens in the regulation of ischemia-induced angiogenesis.

Androgens regulate ischemia-induced angiogenesis by modulating the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-1 $\alpha$ (HIF-1 $\alpha$), which promote neovascularization and cytokine expression.

## What are the theoretical advantages of preoperative testosterone in hypospadias surgery?

Preoperative testosterone theoretically offers several advantages in hypospadias surgery, including increased penile and glanular size and improved prepucial vascularity, potentially leading to better wound healing and surgical outcomes.
