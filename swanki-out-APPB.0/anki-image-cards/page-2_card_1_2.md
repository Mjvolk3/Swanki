## What is the functional derivative and how is it defined in terms of the perturbation $\epsilon \eta(x)$?

The functional derivative of $F[y]$ with respect to $y(x)$, denoted as $\frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)}$, is defined by how $F[y]$ changes when the function $y(x)$ is perturbed to $y(x) + \epsilon \eta(x)$, where $\eta(x)$ is an arbitrary function. Mathematically, this definition is given by:

$$
F[y(x) + \epsilon \eta(x)] = F[y(x)] + \epsilon \int \frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} \eta(x) \, \mathrm{d} x + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)

## Under what condition does the functional derivative need to vanish, and how can one visualize this?

The functional derivative $\frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)}$ must vanish when the functional $F[y]$ is stationary with respect to small variations in the function $y(x)$. This is concluded from the integral condition:

$$
\int \frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} \eta(x) \, \mathrm{d} x = 0
$$

Since this must hold for any arbitrary function $\eta(x)$, the integrand itself must be zero, implying $\frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} = 0$. Visualization involves choosing a perturbation $\eta(x)$ that is non-zero only in a small neighborhood around a point $\widehat{x}$, revealing that the functional derivative must be zero at $x = \widehat{x}$.
