How is the functional derivative of a functional $F[y]$ with respect to $y(x)$ defined?

%

The functional derivative of $F[y]$ with respect to $y(x)$, denoted as $\delta F / \delta y(x)$, is defined by the relation:

$$
F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)]=F[y(x)]+\epsilon \int \frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} \eta(x) \mathrm{d} x+\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)
$$

## Stationarity Condition for Functionals

What condition must be satisfied for a functional $F[y]$ to be stationary with respect to small variations in the function $y(x)$?

%

The condition that must be satisfied is:

$$
\int \frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} \eta(x) \mathrm{d} x=0
$$

Since this must hold for any arbitrary function $\eta(x)$, the functional derivative $\frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)}$ must be zero.
