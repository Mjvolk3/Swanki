## Appendix B of the paper discusses the calculus of variations. What is a functional?

A functional $F[y]$ is an operator that takes a function $y(x)$ and returns a scalar value $F$. 

For example, the entropy $\mathrm{H}[x]$ for a continuous variable $x$ is a functional since it returns the entropy value of $x$ under a given probability density function $p(x)$.

## Define $$y(x+\epsilon)$$ in terms of its expansion.

Given the function $y(x)$, when we make a small change $\epsilon$ to the variable $x$, we can expand $y(x)$ as:

$$
y(x+\epsilon)=y(x)+\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} \epsilon+\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)
$$

Here, $\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)$ represents higher-order terms that become negligible as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$.

## How do functional derivatives in the calculus of variations analogously arise compared to partial derivatives?

Functional derivatives arise in the context of variations of a functional $F[y]$, similar to how partial derivatives arise in functions of several variables.

For a function $y\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{D}\right)$, we have:

$$
y\left(x_{1}+\epsilon_{1}, \ldots, x_{D}+\epsilon_{D}\right)=y\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{D}\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{D} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_{i}} \epsilon_{i}+\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)
$$

For a functional $F[y]$, we consider a small change $\epsilon \eta(x)$ to the function $y(x)$ to define its variation.

## How would one evaluate a conventional derivative $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ using an expansion method without ordinary calculus' rules?

One could evaluate $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ by making a small change $\epsilon$ to $x$ and expanding $y(x+\epsilon)$ as follows:

$$
y(x+\epsilon)=y(x)+\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} \epsilon+\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)
$$

Finally, take the limit as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ to isolate the term involving $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$.

## What is the main goal in the calculus of variations?

In the calculus of variations, the primary objective is to find a function $y(x)$ that maximizes or minimizes a functional $F[y]$. 

This is analogous to finding the value of $x$ that maximizes or minimizes a function $y(x)$ in conventional calculus.

## How is the concept of a functional useful in machine learning?

In machine learning, a functional can represent various objectives, such as the entropy functional $\mathrm{H}[x]$. For a continuous variable $x$ with a probability density function $p(x)$, the entropy functional $\mathrm{H}[p]$ returns the entropy of $x$ under the given density.

Thus, functional forms are critical for defining objectives and constraints in optimization problems in machine learning.

## What is the definition of the functional derivative and how is it represented in an equation?

A functional derivative can be defined by considering how the value of a functional $F[y]$ changes when the function $y(x)$ is changed to $y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)$ where $\eta(x)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$. The functional derivative of $F[y]$ with respect to $y(x)$ is denoted by $\delta F / \delta y(x)$ and is defined by the relation:

$$
F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)]=F[y(x)]+\epsilon \int \frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} \eta(x) \mathrm{d} x+\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)
$$

The functional derivative $\frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)}$ is a measure of how the functional $F[y]$ changes with small variations $\eta(x)$ in the function $y(x)$.

- #calculus.functional-derivative, #functional.analysis

## What condition must hold for a functional to be stationary with respect to small variations in the function $y(x)$?

For a functional to be stationary with respect to small variations in the function $y(x)$, the following condition must hold:

$$
\int \frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} \eta(x) \mathrm{d} x = 0
$$

Because this must be true for any arbitrary function $\eta(x)$, it implies that the functional derivative $\frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)}$ must vanish for all values of $x$. This condition ensures that $F[y]$ is stationary under the perturbation.

- #calculus.functional-derivative, #functional.analysis

## How is a functional defined when it depends on both a function and its derivative, and what is the integral representation?

A functional that depends on a function $y(x)$, its derivative $y'(x)$, and has a direct dependence on $x$ can be defined as an integral over a function $G\left(y(x), y'(x), x\right)$:

$$
F[y]=\int G\left(y(x), y'(x), x\right) \mathrm{d} x
$$

In this definition, $G\left(y(x), y'(x), x\right)$ can be any function that captures the dependencies on $y$, its derivative, and $x$. The boundaries of integration are assumed to be fixed.

- #functional.analysis, #functional-dependency.integration

## How do you cast the variation of the functional \(F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)]\) into the form of (B.3), and what do the terms represent?

To cast the variation of the functional \(F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)]\) into the form of equation (B.3), we consider:

$$
F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)]=F[y(x)]+\epsilon \int \left\{\frac{\partial G}{\partial y} \eta(x) + \frac{\partial G}{\partial y'} \eta'(x)\right\} \mathrm{d} x + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)
$$

By integrating the second term by parts and noting that $\eta(x)$ must vanish at the boundary, we get:

$$
F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)] = F[y(x)] + \epsilon \int \left\{\frac{\partial G}{\partial y} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x}\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial y'}\right)\right\} \eta(x) \mathrm{d} x + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)
$$

Here, $\frac{\partial G}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial G}{\partial y'}$ represent the partial derivatives of the function $G$ with respect to $y$ and $y'$ respectively, capturing how the functional $F$ changes with variations in $y$ and its derivative $y'$.

- #functional-analysis, #partial-derivative.integration

## In the context of functionals, what does it mean for the functional derivative to vanish for all values of $x$?

For the functional derivative to vanish for all values of $x$, 

$$
\frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} = 0
$$

This condition must hold since the functional

$$
\int \frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} \eta(x) \mathrm{d} x = 0
$$

must equal zero for any arbitrary function $\eta(x)$. This vanishing condition ensures that the functional $F[y]$ is stationary, meaning that it has no first-order change under infinitesimal variations in the function $y(x)$. This principle is widely used in variational calculus and functional analysis, often leading to differential equations known as Euler-Lagrange equations.

- #calculus.functional-derivative, #variational.calculus

## When considering variations in the function $y(x)$, what integral expression do we obtain for $F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)]$?

Considering variations in the function $y(x)$, we obtain the expression:

$$ 
F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)] = F[y(x)] + \epsilon \int \left\{\frac{\partial G}{\partial y} \eta(x) + \frac{\partial G}{\partial y'} \eta'(x)\right\} \mathrm{d} x + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)
$$

This expression comes from expanding the functional $F$ around $y(x)$ under the perturbation $\epsilon \eta(x)$ and includes terms representing the partial derivatives of $G$ with respect to $y$ and its derivative $y'$, capturing how $F$ changes under such variations.

How is the functional derivative of a functional $F[y]$ with respect to $y(x)$ defined?

The functional derivative of $F[y]$ with respect to $y(x)$, denoted as $\delta F / \delta y(x)$, is defined by the relation:

What condition must be satisfied for a functional $F[y]$ to be stationary with respect to small variations in the function $y(x)$?

%

The condition that must be satisfied is:

$$
\int \frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} \eta(x) \mathrm{d} x=0
$$

Since this must hold for any arbitrary function $\eta(x)$, the functional derivative $\frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)}$ must be zero.

## What is the functional derivative and how is it defined in terms of the perturbation $\epsilon \eta(x)$? 

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_af52565e380fe828a6d7g-1.jpg?height=254&width=500&top_left_y=291&top_left_x=1069)

%

The functional derivative of $F[y]$ with respect to $y(x)$, denoted as $\frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)}$, is defined by how $F[y]$ changes when the function $y(x)$ is perturbed to $y(x) + \epsilon \eta(x)$, where $\eta(x)$ is an arbitrary function. Mathematically, this definition is given by:

$$
F[y(x) + \epsilon \eta(x)] = F[y(x)] + \epsilon \int \frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} \eta(x) \, \mathrm{d} x + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)

## Under what condition does the functional derivative need to vanish, and how can one visualize this?

%

The functional derivative $\frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)}$ must vanish when the functional $F[y]$ is stationary with respect to small variations in the function $y(x)$. This is concluded from the integral condition:

$$
\int \frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} \eta(x) \, \mathrm{d} x = 0
$$

Since this must hold for any arbitrary function $\eta(x)$, the integrand itself must be zero, implying $\frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} = 0$. Visualization involves choosing a perturbation $\eta(x)$ that is non-zero only in a small neighborhood around a point $\widehat{x}$, revealing that the functional derivative must be zero at $x = \widehat{x}$.

## What is the Euler-Lagrange equation derived from the requirement that the functional derivative vanishes?

The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived from the requirement that the functional derivative vanishes:

$$
\frac{\partial G}{\partial y}-\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x}\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial y^{\prime}}\right)=0
$$

This equation is fundamental in the calculus of variations to determine the stationary points of functionals.

## What is the Euler-Lagrange equation for functionals that do not depend on the derivatives of $y(x)$?

For functionals whose integrands take the form $G(y, x)$ and do not depend on the derivatives of $y(x)$, the stationarity condition requires:

$$
\frac{\partial G}{\partial y(x)} = 0
