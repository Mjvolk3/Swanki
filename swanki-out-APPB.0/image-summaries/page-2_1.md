ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows two curves plotted on a two-dimensional plane. The first curve, represented by the red line, is labeled as \( y(x) \), which indicates that it depicts a function \( y \) as a function of the variable \( x \). The second curve, depicted by the blue line and labeled as \( y(x) + \epsilon \eta(x) \), represents the original function \( y(x) \) being perturbed by an additional term \( \epsilon \eta(x) \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small parameter and \( \eta(x) \) is an arbitrary function of \( x \).

This illustration likely serves to visually demonstrate the concept of a functional and its change when the input function is varied by a small amount, a concept important in the calculus of variations. The idea here is that the functional will respond to the change in the input function, as described in the text accompanying the figure.
