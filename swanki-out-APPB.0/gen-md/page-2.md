## What is the definition of the functional derivative and how is it represented in an equation?

A functional derivative can be defined by considering how the value of a functional $F[y]$ changes when the function $y(x)$ is changed to $y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)$ where $\eta(x)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$. The functional derivative of $F[y]$ with respect to $y(x)$ is denoted by $\delta F / \delta y(x)$ and is defined by the relation:

$$
F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)]=F[y(x)]+\epsilon \int \frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} \eta(x) \mathrm{d} x+\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)
$$

The functional derivative $\frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)}$ is a measure of how the functional $F[y]$ changes with small variations $\eta(x)$ in the function $y(x)$.

## What condition must hold for a functional to be stationary with respect to small variations in the function $y(x)$?

For a functional to be stationary with respect to small variations in the function $y(x)$, the following condition must hold:

$$
\int \frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} \eta(x) \mathrm{d} x = 0
$$

Because this must be true for any arbitrary function $\eta(x)$, it implies that the functional derivative $\frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)}$ must vanish for all values of $x$. This condition ensures that $F[y]$ is stationary under the perturbation.

## How is a functional defined when it depends on both a function and its derivative, and what is the integral representation?

A functional that depends on a function $y(x)$, its derivative $y'(x)$, and has a direct dependence on $x$ can be defined as an integral over a function $G\left(y(x), y'(x), x\right)$:

$$
F[y]=\int G\left(y(x), y'(x), x\right) \mathrm{d} x
$$

In this definition, $G\left(y(x), y'(x), x\right)$ can be any function that captures the dependencies on $y$, its derivative, and $x$. The boundaries of integration are assumed to be fixed.

## How do you cast the variation of the functional \(F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)]\) into the form of (B.3), and what do the terms represent?

To cast the variation of the functional \(F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)]\) into the form of equation (B.3), we consider:

$$
F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)]=F[y(x)]+\epsilon \int \left\{\frac{\partial G}{\partial y} \eta(x) + \frac{\partial G}{\partial y'} \eta'(x)\right\} \mathrm{d} x + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)
$$

By integrating the second term by parts and noting that $\eta(x)$ must vanish at the boundary, we get:

$$
F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)] = F[y(x)] + \epsilon \int \left\{\frac{\partial G}{\partial y} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x}\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial y'}\right)\right\} \eta(x) \mathrm{d} x + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)
$$

Here, $\frac{\partial G}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial G}{\partial y'}$ represent the partial derivatives of the function $G$ with respect to $y$ and $y'$ respectively, capturing how the functional $F$ changes with variations in $y$ and its derivative $y'$.

## In the context of functionals, what does it mean for the functional derivative to vanish for all values of $x$?

For the functional derivative to vanish for all values of $x$, 

$$
\frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} = 0
$$

This condition must hold since the functional

$$
\int \frac{\delta F}{\delta y(x)} \eta(x) \mathrm{d} x = 0
$$

must equal zero for any arbitrary function $\eta(x)$. This vanishing condition ensures that the functional $F[y]$ is stationary, meaning that it has no first-order change under infinitesimal variations in the function $y(x)$. This principle is widely used in variational calculus and functional analysis, often leading to differential equations known as Euler-Lagrange equations.

## When considering variations in the function $y(x)$, what integral expression do we obtain for $F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)]$?

Considering variations in the function $y(x)$, we obtain the expression:

$$ 
F[y(x)+\epsilon \eta(x)] = F[y(x)] + \epsilon \int \left\{\frac{\partial G}{\partial y} \eta(x) + \frac{\partial G}{\partial y'} \eta'(x)\right\} \mathrm{d} x + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)
$$

This expression comes from expanding the functional $F$ around $y(x)$ under the perturbation $\epsilon \eta(x)$ and includes terms representing the partial derivatives of $G$ with respect to $y$ and its derivative $y'$, capturing how $F$ changes under such variations.
