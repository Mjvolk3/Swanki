## What is the Euler-Lagrange equation derived from the requirement that the functional derivative vanishes?

The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived from the requirement that the functional derivative vanishes:

$$
\frac{\partial G}{\partial y}-\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x}\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial y^{\prime}}\right)=0
$$

This equation is fundamental in the calculus of variations to determine the stationary points of functionals.

## Given that $G = y(x)^2 + (y'(x))^2$, derive the specific form of the Euler-Lagrange equation. 

Given the functional:

$$
G = y(x)^2 + (y'(x))^2,
$$

the Euler-Lagrange equation becomes:

$$
y(x) - \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 y}{\mathrm{~d} x^2} = 0
$$

Here, $y(x)$ is the function to be solved subject to boundary conditions.

## What is the Euler-Lagrange equation for functionals that do not depend on the derivatives of $y(x)$?

For functionals whose integrands take the form $G(y, x)$ and do not depend on the derivatives of $y(x)$, the stationarity condition requires:

$$
\frac{\partial G}{\partial y(x)} = 0
$$

This implies that the functional is optimized when $\partial G / \partial y(x) = 0$ for all values of $x$.

## How is the normalization constraint maintained when optimizing a functional with respect to a probability distribution?

When optimizing a functional with respect to a probability distribution, the normalization constraint on the probabilities can be maintained using a Lagrange multiplier. This approach allows an unconstrained optimization to be performed.

## How does the Euler-Lagrange equation change when extended to a multi-dimensional variable?

The extension of the Euler-Lagrange equation to a multi-dimensional variable $\mathbf{x}$ is straightforward. The functional derivative and resulting equations can be generalized to handle multi-dimensional cases, involving partial derivatives with respect to each dimension.

## What form does the Euler-Lagrange equation take for the given $G = y(x)^2 + (y'(x))^2$ example?

For the given:

$$
G = y(x)^2 + (y'(x))^2,
$$

the Euler-Lagrange equation simplifies to:

$$
y(x) - \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 y}{\mathrm{~d} x^2} = 0
$$

The solution $y(x)$ can be found using appropriate boundary conditions.
