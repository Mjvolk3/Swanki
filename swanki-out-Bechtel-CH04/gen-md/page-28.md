## What technique did Claude and Fullam explore for preparing biological specimens for electron microscopy in 1944-5?

Claude and Fullam explored mounting a cutting blade on a disc and rotating it at 50,000 r.p.m. to create sections less than $1 \mu$ in thickness for electron microscopy. They modified the usual techniques for preparing tissues, using a dilute solution of osmic acid for fixation and a new type of embedding material that would sublime at reduced pressure.

## What issues did Claude and Fullam face with their technique for creating thin sections for electron microscopy in 1945?

Claude and Fullam faced issues with their technique as the sections produced were still too thick for electron microscopy. Furthermore, they noted that an entirely satisfactory blade had not yet been found, and further investigation into methods of fixation and embedding of tissues was required to render them suitable for thinner sections.

## What advancements did Claude and Joseph Blum make in microtome design?

Claude and Joseph Blum developed a low-speed microtome where the specimen passed the knife only once as it revolved on a disc or wheel. This design aimed to reduce the potential for tearing the specimen. The microtome also included a liquid-filled trough next to the knife to collect the newly cut sections.

## What were the embedding and fixation problems encountered by Claude and how were they addressed?

Claude encountered problems with embedment and fixation, which were largely resolved by Sanford Newman, Emil Borysko, and Max (names unfinished). The unresolved problems were an insufficiently sharp blade for cutting and the correct embedding agent, which was critical for successful thin sectioning. Fixation techniques involved bringing a dilute solution of osmic acid rapidly into contact with the cell by perfusion.
