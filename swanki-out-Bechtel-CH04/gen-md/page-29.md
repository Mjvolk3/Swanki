## Describe the key advancement made by Harrison Latta and Frank Hartmann in 1950 regarding microtomes.

Latta and Hartmann solved the sharpness problem in microtomes by introducing glass knives, which allowed for the cutting of very thin sections necessary for biological material.

## Discuss how Robertson and Pease reminisced about glass knives in their respective quotes.

Robertson (1987) and Pease (1987) recalled the development and mystique surrounding glass knives. Robertson described the initial skepticism and success of using glass from a milk bottle, while Pease spoke about the search for the ideal "perfect" stain-free glass, including the belief that older glass might be superior.

## Explain the contribution of Keith Porter and Blum (1953) to the development of microtomes and their commercial production.

Porter and Blum developed a microtome that not only cut reliably thin sections but was also user-friendly. Its commercial production by Ivan Sorvall, Inc. in 1955 established its dominance over other designs, including a European competitor by Sj√∂strand (1953a).

## Compare the microtome developed by Porter and Blum to the Cambridge Rocking Microtome and Bennett's experimental instrument.

The microtome by Porter and Blum was said to be similar to the Cambridge Rocking Microtome and an experimental instrument by H. S. Bennett. The key difference was the addition of a gimbal for universal motion and a mechanical advance, credited to Joseph Blum.
