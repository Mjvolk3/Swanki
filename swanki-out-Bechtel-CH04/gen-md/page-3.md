## How did Camillo Golgi's silver nitrate stain contribute to the study of neuron structure?

Camillo Golgi's silver nitrate stain was pivotal as it selectively stained only certain neurons in a preparation, making it evident that the dendrites and axons of one neuron are distinct from those of another. This helped establish the concept that neurons are discrete cells.

## Why is the understanding of scientific instruments not always necessary for their effective use in experimental science?

Ian Hacking pointed out that scientists' confidence in what they are seeing is often robust even when the underlying theory about how the instrument works changes. For instance, a visual display's interpretation remains consistent despite changes in the theoretical understanding of the microscope.

## What challenge did cell biology face before 1940 in linking cytological structures to biochemical functions, and how was it addressed?

Before 1940, cell biology struggled to link cytoplasmic structures to biochemical functions due to a lack of detailed imaging tools and techniques. This challenge was addressed by adopting new instruments and developing specialized techniques, enabling detailed imaging and functional correlation.

## Explain the concept of the "epistemology of evidence" as it relates to the use of scientific instruments.

The "epistemology of evidence" refers to how scientists assess whether their instruments and techniques provide genuine information about the phenomena under study or merely artifacts. This is crucial in determining the reliability and validity of experimental outcomes.
