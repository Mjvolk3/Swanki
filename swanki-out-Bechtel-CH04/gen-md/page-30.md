## What was the significance of developing thin sections for electron microscopy in cell studies?

The development of thin sections was essential because it allowed researchers to study the internal structures of cells with higher resolution using electron microscopy. Thin sections reduced distortions and provided more precise visualizations, crucial for accurate interpretation of cellular components.

## Why were light microscopy techniques using microtomes not an epistemic concern?

The use of microtomes for light microscopy did not generate significant epistemic concerns because the distortions caused by the knife edge (such as tearing) could usually be readily recognized in the resulting micrograph, thus ensuring reliability of the observations.

## Describe the technique for tissue culturing of cells and its importance.

Tissue culturing involves taking small pieces of an embryo and placing them in a medium of plasma and embryonic juice. Specimens are deposited on a coverglass, inverted onto a slide, and sealed with paraffin. This environment allows cells to grow, facilitating observation of their development, and provided sufficiently thin specimens for electron microscopy.

## Explain the observations made by Porter regarding the suitability of tissue-cultured cells for electron microscopy.

Porter noted that cells grown in culture were sufficiently thin, especially at their margins, making them suitable for electron microscopy. This insight came from Porter's experience and ability to recognize the potential of diaphanous (thin and transparent) cells for high-resolution imaging.
