## Describe the composition and purpose of Palade's buffered solution known as "Palade's Pickle."

Palade's buffered solution, commonly referred to as "Palade's Pickle," consists of $1-2\% \mathrm{OsO}_4$ in a neutral Michaelis buffer. This solution is used for staining cells to preserve their fine structure for observation under an electron microscope.

## What was Sjöstrand's main criticism of Palade's technique regarding the $\mathrm{pH}$ of the osmium tetroxide solution?

Sjöstrand criticized Palade's emphasis on maintaining the $\mathrm{pH}$ of the osmium tetroxide fixative, arguing that varying $\mathrm{pH}$ within a wide range (from $\mathrm{pH}$ 4 to $\mathrm{pH}$ 8) does not substantially affect fixation results in many tissues like the kidney, intestinal epithelium, and sensory epithelium of the inner ear. He claimed most differences Palade described were due to post-mortem changes.

## Explain the importance of tonicity according to Sjöstrand's critique of Palade's technique.

Sjöstrand argued that the tonicity of the fixative is crucial. He pointed out that Palade's osmium tetroxide solution is strongly hypotonic, which can cause swelling of the cells. He emphasized the use of isotonic solutions to prevent this swelling and claimed that isotonic non-buffered solutions of osmium tetroxide can preserve cell structure as well as isotonic sodium chloride solutions.

## What was the primary difference in the use of electron micrographs between Palade and Sjöstrand, according to Rasmussen?

According to Rasmussen, the primary difference in the use of electron micrographs between Palade and Sjöstrand stemmed from their objectives. For Palade, the use was primarily qualitative—aimed at providing a morphological perspective on biochemical information from fractionation and functional analysis of cellular components like mitochondria. Sjöstrand, on the other hand, appeared to focus more on the precision and preservation of cell structure in the micrographs.
