## Explain the process by which Palade and Claude identified myelin figures from lipid droplets and linked this identification to their morphology and intracellular distribution.

Palade and Claude (1949b) observed that myelin figures developed from lipid droplets with high phospholipid content. They noted that these figures exhibited certain morphological features such as polymorphism and specific intracellular distribution.

## What conclusion did Palade and Claude reach regarding the role of acidity in the formation of myelin figures?

Palade and Claude concluded that a wave of acidity moving through the preparation corresponded to the formation of myelin figures. They proposed that the acid facilitated the hydrolysis of phospholipid molecules, turning them into more soluble substances that could then form into myelin figures.

## Describe the method used by Palade and Claude to distinguish the role of lipid droplets and their specific gravity in the function of the Golgi apparatus.

Palade and Claude employed high-speed centrifugation to segregate the Golgi apparatus. They inferred that lipid droplets, owing to their specific gravity being less than that of the cytoplasm, could be displaced within the cell through centrifugation.

## Summarize the evidence Palade and Claude provided to support their hypothesis that the Golgi apparatus might be an artifact.

Palade and Claude noted that by using common fixation and staining procedures, they could produce images resembling the Golgi apparatus. They traced the development of these images from phospholipid inclusions and offered theoretical explanations, showing that myelin figures could result from the rearrangement of hydrolyzed phospholipids facilitated by an acidic environment and stabilized by electrolytes.
