## What technical problems arise during centrifugation and what empirical method helps to mitigate these issues?

During centrifugation, particles may sediment along with others of different masses, adhere to the centrifugation tube's walls, agglutinate, and set up convection currents, entrapping smaller particles. 

Repeated resolubilization and recentrifugation can help overcome these difficulties.

## Why did some researchers suspect there were more than four distinct constituents of cells that could be separated by fractionation?

They suspected more than four distinct constituents because there were known organelles not distinguished in the four basic fractions. Researchers such as Hubert Chantrenne and Novikoff et al. developed methods to isolate additional fractions, revealing a chemical composition that blended into each other with no precise demarcation lines between particle groups.

## What was Hubert Chantrenneâ€™s conclusion regarding the partitioning of granules in a centrifuge?

Hubert Chantrenne concluded that one could partition the granules into as many groups as desired without clear experimental or observational evidence indicating precise demarcation lines between different groups of particles.

## Despite evidence for additional cell fractions, why did the four-fraction approach remain dominant in cell fractionation studies?

The four-fraction approach remained dominant because these fractions were identified with cell structures for which functions were already suspected. Moreover, the Golgi apparatus, which the scheme did not account for, was still considered by some researchers to be an artifact until clear evidence of its function emerged in the 1960s.
