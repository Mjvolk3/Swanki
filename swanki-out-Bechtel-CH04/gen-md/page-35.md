## Explain the risk associated with forming ice crystals during the freeze-drying of cells.

During freeze-drying, ice crystals can form, which could dislocate cell structures. However, this artifact is generally identifiable as it is usually gross.

## Describe the comparative findings of Fern치ndez-Mor치n (1952) on nerve fibers using freeze-drying versus osmium fixation.

Fern치ndez-Mor치n (1952) concluded that both freeze-drying and osmium fixation revealed nearly identical structures in nerve fibers, but better preservation and contrast were achieved with osmium fixation. Thus, osmium fixation was recommended for routine examinations.

## What was one disadvantage of freeze-drying according to the paper?

One disadvantage of freeze-drying mentioned in the paper is that it is more difficult to perform and produces specimens that are extremely fragile.

## What conclusion did some researchers reach about the accuracy of freeze-drying in electron microscope studies?

Some researchers concluded that freeze-drying provides an incorrect picture of protoplasm structure, noting shrinkage and distortion of certain microorganisms like Bacillus megatherium, even more than with air-drying.
