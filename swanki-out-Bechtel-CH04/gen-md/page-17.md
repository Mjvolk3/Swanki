## Explain the effect of sucrose concentration on mitochondria in fractionation studies as described in the text.

Different sucrose concentrations have varying effects on the functional and morphological integrity of mitochondria during fractionation studies. For instance, using $0.88 \,\mathrm{M}$ sucrose helps to preserve the rod-like appearance of mitochondria but results in the loss of ATP synthesis capability. Conversely, $0.25 \,\mathrm{M}$ sucrose allows the mitochondrial fraction to carry out oxidative phosphorylation, though this compromises the resemblance of the particles to intact mitochondria.

## Summarize the findings of Hogeboom et al. (1948) regarding the preservation of mitochondrial morphology using different sucrose concentrations.

Hogeboom et al. (1948) found that a hypertonic $0.88 \,\mathrm{M}$ sucrose medium preserved the rod-like appearance of mitochondria in fractionation studies. However, this medium failed to maintain ATP synthesis, suggesting a form/function tradeoff.

## Compare the functional activities of isolated thymus nuclei in different sucrose solutions as discussed in the text.

Functional activity of isolated thymus nuclei varies with sucrose concentration. Nuclei isolated in $0.25 \,\mathrm{M}$ sucrose can synthesize protein and RNA, whereas those prepared in $0.4\,\mathrm{M}$ sucrose lose this capacity.

## What effects do pH and ionic strength have on the appearance and function of isolated nuclei according to the text?

Allfrey (1959) discussed that, along with sucrose concentration, other factors like $\mathrm{pH}$ and ionic strength affect the appearance and functionality of isolated nuclei. For instance, calf thymocyte nuclei isolated in $0.25\,\mathrm{M}$ sucrose and $0.003\,\mathrm{M} \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$ are granular in appearance but remain active in many synthetic systems. In contrast, nuclei isolated in a hypertonic medium that preserves optical homogeneity lose their synthetic capacity.
