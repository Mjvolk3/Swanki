## Explain the significance of calibration in vindicating a new scientific technique, as discussed in the paper.

Calibration is essential for determining whether a new technique captures the same underlying phenomenon as an older, established technique. It may involve using the older technique as a reference point and adjusting the new technique to align with the previously procured evidence.

Calibration can indicate that both techniques are reflecting an objective phenomenon, even if they are not independent.

## What is the critical assumption when appealing to the consilience of different inductions?

The critical assumption is that the different inductions are independent of each other. If they are not independent, significant manipulation might be required to align new techniques with older ones, which affects the consilience and reliability.

## Under what circumstances might you become suspicious of results produced by a new scientific technique?

You might become suspicious if the new results do not fit into any plausible theoretical account or model of the phenomenon under investigation. If you cannot generate such an account, it raises doubts about the reliability of the new technique.

## Why is it necessary to compare the artifacts created by different scientific techniques, such as electron microscopy vs. optical methods?

It is necessary because each technique has its own limitations and potential for artifact creation. Comparing across methods helps in critically correlating all clues to provide a coherent understanding of the specimen's structure and constitution.
