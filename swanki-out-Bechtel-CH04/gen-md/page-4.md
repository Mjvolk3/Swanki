## What were two techniques especially successful in opening up the territory between biochemistry and cytology in the 1940s and 1950s?

The two techniques were:
1. Obtaining micrographs showing the fine structure of cells using the electron microscope.
2. Chemical analysis of cell fractions separated by means of the ultracentrifuge.

## Describe the process and goal of cell fractionation.

The goal of cell fractionation is to pinpoint the particular organelle in which each enzyme is found and determine the biochemical reaction associated with the organelle. The process involves the following steps:
1. Force is applied to break the plasma membrane of the cell, dispersing its contents.
2. The contents are centrifuged at forces several thousand times that of gravity, causing different cell constituents to settle according to their mass.
3. Multiple iterations are conducted, where the contents may be resolubilized and subjected to centrifugation again.

## What underlying assumption is made in the process of cell fractionation?

The underlying assumption in cell fractionation is that different cell constituents will settle in order of their mass when subjected to centrifugation, with the components of greatest mass settling first.

## Explain the role of the ultracentrifuge in the chemical analysis of cell fractions.

The ultracentrifuge is used in the chemical analysis of cell fractions to separate various components of a cell based on their mass. When cells are broken down, their contents are subjected to the high centrifugal forces generated by the ultracentrifuge. This separation allows for biochemical analysis of each fraction to identify which enzymes are present and the reactions they support.
