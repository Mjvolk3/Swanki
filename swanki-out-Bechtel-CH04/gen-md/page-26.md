## Describe why it was necessary to obtain sufficiently thin specimens in early electron microscopy.

Electron beams in early electron microscopes, which operated with relatively low power, could only penetrate up to $0.1 \mathrm{~mm}$ of biological tissue. This penetration depth is less than the thickness of a typical cell, necessitating the alteration of tissue to produce an image.

## Why did researchers choose to study already thin biological materials initially in electron microscopy?

Early researchers like Thomas Anderson and Francis O. Schmitt's group chose already thin materials like bacterial and viral specimens because they were naturally thin enough to be imaged by the electron microscope without additional processing.

## Three strategies were pursued to produce sufficiently thin specimens for electron microscopy. Describe these strategies.

The three strategies were:
(a) Use naturally thin biological materials.
(b) Section the specimens into thin slices.
(c) Induce the specimens to spread thinly to create an image.

## What is shadow casting and how was it used in electron microscopy?

Shadow casting involves depositing a heavy metal (e.g., gold or chromium) on the surface of a specimen at an oblique angle. This generates a shadow in the micrograph, with the length of the shadow corresponding to the height of the material on the specimen. This method was sometimes employed to successfully image viruses and bacteria (Williams \& Wyckoff, 1946).
