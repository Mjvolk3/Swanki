## Why was there controversy regarding the use of buffered osmium as a fixative?

Investigators had different evaluations of techniques based on their results and conformance to theoretical expectations. For example, Palade preferred buffered osmium because it produced results aligning with biochemistry and cell fractionation methods. However, other researchers, like Jean Brachet, doubted the reliability of micrographs produced with buffered osmium, worrying about possible artifacts.

According to Jean Brachet (1957), what were his critiques on the reliability of osmium-fixed tissues in electron microscopy?

Jean Brachet expressed concerns that the beautiful micrographs produced by osmium-fixed tissues might contain artifacts. He noted that certain structures like reticulum, which he didn't observe in living cells using an 'anoptral' microscope, became conspicuous only after osmium fixation. He suggested that some structures might be fixation artifacts and that others, which do not fix osmium well, might be invisible using electron microscopy.

What were the two new structures that appeared in the micrographs made with the new osmium fixative according to the text?

The two new structures that appeared in the micrographs made with the new osmium fixative were the cristae of the mitochondria and the ribosomes on the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings were significant because they aligned with biochemical data and cell fractionation results.

What concerns might arise when relying on a single fixative, such as buffered osmium, for definitive cell structure analysis?

The primary concern is that a single fixative might generate fixation artifacts, resulting in misleading representations of cell structures. Techniques that rely solely on one fixative might fail to visualize structures that do not bind well to the fixative, potentially overlooking critical cellular components.
