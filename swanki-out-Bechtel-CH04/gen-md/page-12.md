## What innovation did Theodor Svedberg introduce with his centrifuge in 1924?

In 1924, Theodor Svedberg, along with Herman Rinde, introduced an electrically driven centrifuge that generated higher rotational speeds. This innovation allowed for greater centrifugal forces and incorporated a window through which sedimentation could be observed.

## Why is the term 'ultracentrifuge' significant and how did its meaning evolve over time?

Initially, Theodor Svedberg referred to his centrifuge as an ultracentrifuge because it allowed for direct observation of sedimentation during the centrifugation process. Later, the term evolved to denote any centrifuge that operated at high speeds in a vacuum or near a vacuum.

## What advancements did Jesse Beams and Edward Pickels contribute to centrifuge technology in the early 20th century?

Jesse Beams, together with graduate student Edward Pickels, modified Henriot's design by introducing a larger rotor enclosed in a vacuum chamber and suspended by a steel wire. Subsequently, Pickels designed an electrically driven ultracentrifuge that was user-friendly and practical for investigators.

## What were the significant results achieved by Robert Bensley and Normand L. Hoerr using the centrifuge in cellular studies during the early 1930s?

Robert Bensley and Normand L. Hoerr used the centrifuge to isolate cell structures and were able to reliably produce a fraction they identified as mitochondrial based on particle size. Their work in the early 1930s significantly advanced the study of cell biology.
