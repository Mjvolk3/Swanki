## What two main tools helped establish new evidence about cellular components in the 1940s and 1950s?

Cell fractionation and electron microscopy were the two main tools that helped establish new evidence about cellular components and their operations during the 1940s and 1950s.

## What criteria were used to establish the credibility of cell fractionation and electron microscopy?

The criteria used to establish the credibility of cell fractionation and electron microscopy included:
1. Determinacy and repeatability of results.
2. Consilience with results obtained in other ways and especially with each other.
3. Coherence with emerging mechanistic models accounting for various cellular phenomena.

## Explain the significance of consilience in establishing the credibility of scientific techniques.

Consilience refers to the agreement or alignment of results obtained from different methods or approaches. In the context of cell fractionation and electron microscopy:
1. Consilience ensured that the results from these techniques agreed with each other.
2. It also ensured that these results aligned with those obtained from other scientific methods.

Such alignment strengthened the credibility of these techniques in investigating cellular components.

## How did the mechanistic model for the Golgi apparatus contribute to changing opinions about its existence?

Once the Golgi apparatus was shown to have a specific mechanism—namely, packaging proteins for secretion—doubts about its existence quickly vanished. This mechanistic understanding provided a clear functional role within the cell, making it easier for scientists to accept the Golgi apparatus as a real and vital component of cellular operation.
