## Discuss the benefits of using osmium tetroxide ($\mathrm{OsO}_{4}$) as a fixative in electron microscopy compared to other fixatives.

Osmium tetroxide ($\mathrm{OsO}_{4}$) is highly favored as a fixative because it yields the clearest and most detailed images. Unlike formaldehyde, which fails to show cytoplasmic structures, or chromic acid, which shrinks the cytoplasm, osmium tetroxide does not cause severe structural distortions. It has a long history of successful use dating back to Max Shultze's studies in 1865.

## What was the main reason formaldehyde was not suitable as a fixative in early electron microscopy studies?

Formaldehyde was found to be unsuitable as a fixative in early electron microscopy because it failed to show cytoplasmic structures. This resulted in a lack of detailed and clear images of the cells and cellular components.

## Explain the freeze-drying preparation technique and its advantages over chemical fixation in microscopy. Include temperature details in your answer.

Freeze-drying involves freezing small tissue pieces and keeping them over sulfuric acid in vacuo at a temperature of $-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. This method avoids the liquid phase that could distort the cell, leading to a more accurate dehydration of tissue. The freeze-drying process introduced by Altmann and later improved by Bensley and Gersh involves even colder temperatures, down to $-40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

## Why is freeze-drying preferred in some cases over chemical fixation? Mention pioneering researchers in your answer.

Freeze-drying is preferred over chemical fixation because it prevents the liquid phase from distorting the cell structures. This technique results in more accurate tissue dehydration. Altmann pioneered this method in 1890, and Bensley and Gersh later revived and enhanced it by utilizing even lower temperatures.
