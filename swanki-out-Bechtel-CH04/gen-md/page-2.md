## What are the similarities and differences between our visual system and scientific instruments in terms of generating artifact evidence?

The visual system, although prone to illusions, has been finely tuned by natural selection, making dramatic errors relatively rare. Scientific instruments, on the other hand, are at a high risk of generating artifacts because they lack such evolutionary refinement. These artifacts are contested until the instruments are refined and standardized within the scientific community.

## Why is evidence generated using new scientific instruments and techniques often vigorously contested by competing scientists?

New instruments and techniques are prone to generating artifacts, leading to questions about whether the evidence truly reflects natural phenomena. The controversy is intense until the instruments and techniques are refined and standardized within the scientific community.

## Why is it important to distinguish between scientific instruments and the techniques for using them?

The reliability of the evidence produced often depends as much on the techniques used as on the instruments themselves. This is highlighted by the fact that, unlike our natural senses, scientific instruments require trained techniques for accurate operation.

## How did the series "Methods in Enzymology" and "Methods in Cell Physiology" contribute to the standardization of scientific techniques?

The series "Methods in Enzymology" (begun in 1955) and "Methods in Cell Physiology" (renamed "Methods in Cell Biology" in 1973) published volumes that helped standardize procedures and techniques, contributing to the refinement and reliability of scientific instruments and methods within the community.
