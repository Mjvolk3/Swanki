## What were the major limitations of the RCA EM-A electron microscope and why was it not suited for commercial development?

The RCA EM-A microscope, designed by Vladimir K. Zworykin and Ladislaus Marton, had serious limitations in maintaining a vacuum, making it unsuitable for commercial development.

## Who was hired to replace Ladislaus Marton at RCA in 1940, and what was his major contribution to electron microscopy?

In early 1940, James Hillier was hired to replace Ladislaus Marton at RCA. Hillier designed the RCA EM-B, which became a commercially viable electron microscope.

## What were the two primary challenges faced by biologists when using the new electron microscope to study cell structures during WWII?

The two primary challenges were:

1. Preparing specimens sufficiently thin to be penetrated by the electron beam.
2. Transforming specimens to survive conditions within the electron microscope and produce useful images.
