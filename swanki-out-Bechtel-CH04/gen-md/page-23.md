## What is the theoretical resolution limit of a 50 kV electron microscope compared to a light microscope in terms of Angstrom units ($\AA$)?

The theoretical resolution limit of a 50 kV electron microscope is between 5-10 $\AA$. In contrast, light microscopes using white light have a resolution limit of approximately 2,500 $\AA$. This means that electron microscopes offer significantly better resolution compared to light microscopes.

## What are the main differences between light microscopes and electron microscopes?

The main differences between light microscopes and electron microscopes are as follows:
1. Source of Illumination: Electron microscopes use an electron beam, while light microscopes use a light beam.
2. Viewing Mechanism: In electron microscopes, the image is viewed on a fluorescent screen or photograph, not directly through the microscope.
3. Image Formation: Electron microscope images result from the scattering of electrons, not the absorption of light of various wavelengths.

These factors lead to electron microscopes having generally higher resolution capabilities compared to light microscopes.

## With respect to the principles of microscopy, what lens types are common to both electron and light microscopes?

The lens types common to both electron and light microscopes are:
1. Source of Illumination
2. Condenser Lens: For controlling the illumination.
3. Objective Lens: For focusing the image.
4. Additional Lenses: For providing high magnification.

## Explain the significance of phase contrast microscopy in biological studies.

Phase contrast microscopy converts phase differences in light refracted from cell structures into differences in amplitude, seen as image contrast. This method is particularly useful for in vivo studies, allowing for the observation of live cells without staining.
