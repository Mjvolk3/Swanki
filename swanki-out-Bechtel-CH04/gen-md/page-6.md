## What was one of the major concerns during the introduction of electron microscopy in the 1940s and 1950s?
 
During the introduction of electron microscopy in the 1940s and 1950s, one of the major concerns was whether the micrograph could be interpreted in such a way as to obtain good information about cell structure. The fear was that it might be a mere artifact, making it impossible to recover the original cell structure.

## What kind of critiques did Alex Novikoff refer to as "essentially destructive comments" by "gloomy critics" in the 1950s?

Alex Novikoff referred to various critiques about artifacts as "essentially destructive comments" by "gloomy critics." These critiques included concerns about losing significant information concerning in vivo functions when a cell was homogenized, the use of aqueous media yielding misleading particles, and oxidative phosphorylation retention.

## Describe the potential issues with staining methods for demonstrating the intracellular in situ localization of enzymes, according to Novikoff's 1959 critique.

Potential issues with staining methods for demonstrating the intracellular in situ localization of enzymes included enzyme destruction by fixative and diffusion of the reaction product during incubation. These factors were considered to make staining methods worthless for accurate localization of important enzymes.

## What structures were often challenged in cytology as potential artifacts produced by fixation, as mentioned in the passage?

Structures that were often challenged in cytology as potential artifacts produced by fixation included mitochondria, Nissl bodies of nerve cells, myofibrils of smooth and striated muscle, and chromatin granules of the resting nuclei. These were sometimes incorrectly attributed to chemical processes during sample preparation.
