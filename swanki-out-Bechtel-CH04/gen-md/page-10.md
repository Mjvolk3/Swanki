## What are the three criteria proposed for assessing a new research instrument or technique based on the results it generates?

The three criteria proposed for evaluating a new research instrument or technique are:
1. The degree to which the results exhibit a determinate structure or pattern and are repeatable.
2. The agreement of the results with those generated by other techniques or if they can be calibrated against them.
3. The coherence of the putative evidence with theoretical accounts that are taken to be plausible.

## Why might some researchers worry that evaluating evidence based on its coherence with plausible accounts is circular reasoning?

Researchers might worry that evaluating evidence based on its coherence with plausible accounts could be circular reasoning because it would imply that one is assessing the evidence by an account (or model) which is itself evaluated by relying on the same evidence. However, such reasoning is only circular if the sole basis for evaluating the account is the results of the experimental techniques, ignoring other ways an account could be evaluated.

## How does the evidential coherence with theoretical accounts play a role in the acceptance of new cell organelles and instruments?

In the context of cell biology, new cell organelles were often suggested by new research instruments and techniques. The acceptance of these organelles (and thereby the instruments and techniques) depended on whether they could be identified as having a role in the emerging mechanistic model of cell function. If they fit within the model, researchers were more likely to accept both the organelles and the instruments that indicated their existence.

## How do the criteria for evaluating new instruments or techniques help in addressing charges of artifacts in scientific research?

The criteria help in addressing charges of artifacts by:
1. Ensuring results that exhibit a structured, repeatable pattern, indicating they are not random artifacts.
2. Cross-verifying results with those from other techniques or calibrated methods to establish reliability.
3. Checking if the results align with existing plausible theoretical accounts, reinforcing their validity beyond potential artifacts.
