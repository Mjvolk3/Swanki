## What is the functional decomposition in cell study and why is it important?
Functional decomposition is the process of breaking down a complex system into smaller, more manageable functionalities to understand each component's specific role. In the study of cells, this method helps researchers determine the function of individual cell components and how they contribute to the cell's overall operations. For example, identifying specific enzymes in organelles may indicate their roles.

## What is the principle behind using centripetal force in a centrifuge and what challenges arise when using it for cell fractionation?

A centrifuge employs centrifugal force $F_c = m \cdot \omega^2 \cdot r$ to separate particles based on their size and weight, where $m$ is the mass of the particle, $\omega$ is the angular velocity, and $r$ is the radius of the rotation. However, challenges include breaking the cell membranes without disrupting the natural assembly of components and combining multiple cells' contents in one solution. 

$$F_c = m \cdot \omega^2 \cdot r$$

## Who was Johann Friedrich Miescher and what significant contribution did he make using a centrifuge?

Johann Friedrich Miescher was a Swiss biologist who, in 1869, used chemical agents such as warm alcohol and pepsin to strip cell membranes and then utilized centrifugation to isolate cell nuclei. This led him to identify a new group of cellular substances called nucleins, which were later recognized as nucleic acids by his student Richard Altmann.

## Why was there skepticism around the use of centrifugation for cell fractionation in early twentieth-century research?

During the early twentieth century, many researchers were skeptical of centrifugation because it involved disrupting the cell's internal structure, which they assumed to be critical for maintaining its functions. This skepticism hindered the widespread use of centrifugation for isolating cell structures despite attempts by researchers like Otto Warburg.
