## What techniques were considered sufficient to demonstrate unique cellular loci in the 1950s, according to the text?

Cytochemical techniques, such as the Feulgen stain, were considered sufficient to demonstrate unique cellular loci in the 1950s.

## According to the text, what was the general perspective on cell fractionation in the 1950s, and what were two sources of skepticism regarding its results?

By the 1950s, cell fractionation was generally regarded as providing reliable evidence of the enzyme composition of cell organelles and thus of their function. However, skepticism remained due to:

1. Doubts that the isolated fractions reflected activities in living cells (expressed by James Danielli).
2. Concerns that isolated enzymatic components might not be present in the same locations within living cells (expressed by F.K. Sanders).

## What was the viewpoint of de Duve and Berthet regarding the limitations of differential centrifugation for studying tissue enzymes, based on the text?

De Duve and Berthet acknowledged that while differential centrifugation offered tremendous possibilities, it had significant limitations, particularly when applied to studying tissue enzymes. They emphasized that the technique provided only the roughest information concerning the true intracellular distributions of enzymes and stressed the necessity for additional experiments to derive real significance from these results.

## Why did researchers continue to rely on cell fractionation despite the skepticism and lack of theoretical understanding, according to the text?

Researchers continued to rely on cell fractionation because:
(a) It produced determinate results.
(b) These results to some extent corresponded to results from other techniques.
(c) The results fit into a developing mechanistic model of the cell.
