## What issue did de Duve and Berthet identify with using different types of homogenizers for cell fractionation?

de Duve and Berthet identified that simple rubbing in a mortar only disrupts a fraction of the cells, and mechanical choppers cause excessive damage to the particulate components of the cells.

## What are the drawbacks of the Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer according to de Duve and Berthet, and what precaution should be taken while using it?

The Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer is not entirely free of drawbacks such as causing some damage to the cells, and it should be used with discrimination.

## What critical role does the choice of aqueous medium play in cell fractionation once cell membranes are broken?

Once the cell membranes are broken, the properties of the aqueous medium into which the cell contents disperse become critical for the ensuing biochemical processes and component isolation.

## What recommendation did de Duve and Berthet make regarding the preferred choice of homogenizers for cell fractionation, and what are the alternatives?

de Duve and Berthet recommended the homogenizers described by Potter and Elvehjem (1936) as the preferred choice due to lesser cell damage compared to simple rubbing in a mortar (Claude, 1946) or mechanical choppers (Waring Blender).
