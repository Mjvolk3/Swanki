## What criterion did the developers of cell fractionation techniques aim to satisfy, and how did early fractionation studies fail this test?

The developers of cell fractionation techniques aimed to satisfy the criterion of correspondence with evidence from other procedures. Early fractionation studies failed this test because the isolated, centrifuged organelles did not resemble their appearance under the light microscope.

## Explain the concept of "black box" as used by Latour in the context of cell fractionation.

Latour characterized a technique as a "black box" when the steps involved are taken for granted as part of established practice. By the late 1950s and 1960s, cell fractionation had achieved this status, with recipes for performing it widely available in experimental manuals.

## Describe the aqueous approach to preparing materials for cell fractionation.

In the aqueous approach, the material is placed in an aqueous medium, such as a $0.88 \mathrm{M}$ sucrose solution when targeting mitochondria, and shearing forces are used to break the cell membranes. The resulting material is called a homogenate because the cells are broken and their contents blended.

$$
\text{Aqueous Medium: } 0.88 \mathrm{M} \text{ sucrose solution}
$$

## How did Hogeboom, Schneider, and Palade attempt to address the issue of isolated mitochondria not retaining their typical shape in early fractionation studies?

Hogeboom, Schneider, and Palade (1948) explored alternative media to make isolated mitochondria retain their typical elongated shape and stain appropriately with Janus Green B, a traditional mitochondrial stain, in response to the isolated mitochondria not retaining their typical shape as observed under the light microscope.
