## Explain the role of independent techniques in resolving concerns about chemical fixation.

The correspondence of results produced by two independent techniques resolved chief worries about chemical fixation. This was because the results from the other technique provided confidence in the chemical fixation.

## What was Fernandez-Morán's conclusion about osmium tetroxide and its effect on preservation based on? 

Fernandez-Morán concluded that osmium yields better preservation based not merely on image correspondence but on independent expectations of what the image should look like. This indicates that he had preexisting criteria for assessing image quality.

## Why did osmium tetroxide become the preferred fixative for electron microscopy?

Osmium tetroxide won favor as the fixative of choice for electron microscopy because:
1. It produced micrographs with greater detail.
2. The images were consistent with those produced by light microscopy and freeze-drying.

## According to Bretschneider, what mixtures produced the highest degree of coagulation in the radicular cells of a plant?

According to Bretschneider, mixtures of formalin and osmium tetroxide, especially when combined with chromic acid or potassium dichromate, produced the highest degree of coagulation.
