## Describe the significance of Louis de Broglie's discovery in 1924 for electron microscopy.

Louis de Broglie's discovery that electrons have wave properties with wavelength inversely proportional to electron velocity provided the theoretical foundation for electron microscopy. This concept is expressed by the de Broglie wavelength equation:

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}$$

where:
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength,
- $h$ is Planck's constant (approximately $6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ Js),
- $p$ is the momentum of the electron,
- $m$ is the mass of the electron,
- $v$ is the velocity of the electron.

This foundational concept allowed scientists to understand and harness the wave properties of electrons for imaging at much smaller scales than possible with light microscopy.

## Explain how Hans Busch's contribution in 1926 aided the development of electron microscopes.

Hans Busch showed how to focus the electron beam by means of magnetic lenses in 1926. Magnetic lenses are used to bend and focus the paths of electrons in the same way that optical lenses bend and focus light waves. This achievement was crucial for the development of electron microscopes.

A magnetic lens uses the Lorentz force to alter the trajectory of electrons:

$$\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})$$

where:
- $\mathbf{F}$ is the force on the electron,
- $q$ is the charge of the electron,
- $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field,
- $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of the electron,
- $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field.

The focusing action enables electrons to be directed precisely, leading to clearer and more resolved images.

## What was Ernst Ruska's major contribution to electron microscopy in 1933?

Ernst Ruska introduced the first true compound electron microscope in 1933, which significantly increased the resolving power of electron microscopes. The compound electron microscope utilizes multiple magnetic lenses to focus and magnify the electron beam, allowing for higher resolution images than those achievable with light microscopes.

The resolution $d$ of an electron microscope can be approximated using:

$$d = \frac{0.61 \lambda}{n \sin \theta}$$

where:
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the electrons,
- $n$ is the refractive index,
- $\theta$ is the half-angle of the lens aperture.

Ruska's advancement enabled the observation of much finer structural details in biological and material samples.

## Detail the relationship between electron velocity and wavelength as discovered by Louis de Broglie. How did this contribute to electron microscopy?

According to Louis de Broglie's theory, electrons exhibit wave properties with a wavelength inversely proportional to their velocity. The de Broglie wavelength equation:

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$$

illustrates this relationship, where:
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength,
- $h$ is Planck's constant,
- $m$ is the mass of the electron,
- $v$ is the velocity of the electron.

In electron microscopy, this principle allows control over the resolving power by adjusting the electron velocity. Higher velocities translate to shorter wavelengths and thus higher resolution imaging. This understanding was pivotal in utilizing electrons for microscopy, as theorized by de Broglie and later practicalized by other scientists.
