### Card 1

## What was significant about the micrographs of tissue-cultured cells developed by Porter, Claude, and Fullam in 1945?
%
The micrographs of tissue-cultured cells taken by Porter, Claude, and Fullam in 1945 were significant because they provided an image of the cytoplasm eight years before comparable images were available using thin slicing techniques. This discovery initiated a line of research on a new structure identified first in these micrographs as a lace-like reticulum. The technique of creating these micrographs was delicate and not widely adopted, but it dramatically improved the understanding of cellular structures.

### Card 2

## Explain the primary challenge and success rate Porter mentioned regarding the preparation of specimens for electron microscopy.
%
Porter noted that the preparation of adequate specimens was initially a discouraging process held up by the need for precision and steadiness. He found only about $50\%$ of the specimens to be satisfactory. This was based on his experience observing cultures grown on Formvar-coated coverslips, which were then transferred to EM grids. Despite this, the first successfully prepared specimen yielded an unexpectedly high amount of structural information, which was more than anticipated.

### Card 3

## What was the main concern regarding the micrographs of tissue-cultured cells being subject to artifacts according to the excerpt?
%
The main concern was that the spreading of tissue-cultured cells, which made them suitable for electron microscopy, might introduce artifacts. Specifically, the concern was that these cultured cells were grown in unnatural conditions that could distort their normal reality. For example, the specialized milieu in culture does not reflect the actual environments of cells within an organism under neural, hormonal, and neurohumoral influences.

### Card 4

## Describe the differences between the environments of cultured cells and cells in an actual multicellular organism, as noted by Novikoff.
%
Novikoff highlighted that cultured cells are grown in highly controlled conditions that may reveal their capacities but not their actual behavior in a multicellular organism. In vivo, cells experience a complex environment embedded in tissue mucopolysaccharide or tightly wedged among neighboring cells (e.g., in epithelial layers). They are continuously subjected to controlling influences such as neural, hormonal, and neurohumoral signals, which are absent in cultured conditions.
