## Based on the provided text, I will create four Anki flashcards focusing on scientific details and potential math equations. Here are the cards:

## What is one method mentioned for validating the reliability of a new scientific technique?

- One method for validating the reliability of a new scientific technique is to examine whether there is a distinguishable structure or pattern in the results. If the results show a consistent pattern rather than randomness, it suggests that the technique may be picking up a legitimate signal rather than generating noise.

## How can scientists address the claim that a technique's results are artifacts rather than true representations of phenomena?

- Scientists can address the claim that a technique's results are artifacts by requiring the burden of proof to be on the person alleging artifact. If a plausible account of how the technique itself could generate the structure is provided, it can raise suspicion of artifactual findings. However, in the absence of such an account, scientists are inclined to interpret structure in their results as reflective of the phenomenon itself.

## In the context of enzyme distribution via cell fractionation studies, what kind of pattern in the results might increase scientists' confidence in the technique?

- In cell fractionation studies, finding a pattern where particular enzymes appear in high concentrations in one fraction and low concentrations in others, and other enzymes having higher concentrations in another fraction, suggests that the distribution of enzymes is indicative of their original distribution within the cell's organelles. Such a pattern would increase scientists' confidence in the technique.

## What was Keith Porter's reaction to his first micrograph of a cell, and what was the significance of this reaction?

- Keith Porter, upon examining his first micrograph of a cell, had no doubt that it was revealing something about the cell due to the impressive structure observed. This reaction underscores the importance of visual structure in determining the validity of scientific findings, as a clear and consistent structure suggests that the observations are revealing real phenomena and not artifacts.
