## What was Sjöstrand's reason for focusing on the quantitative size of cellular components at the Third International Conference on Electron Microscopy?

Sjöstrand emphasized the importance of quantitative measurements to identify and classify different cellular components accurately. He believed that the electron microscope, if mastered to provide high resolution, could serve as an efficient measuring device to give an exact quantitative description of cellular structures.

## Explain Palade's argument against the reliability of electron microscopy for quantitative conclusions. Cite the specific statement he made.

Palade argued that the dimensions and spacings shown by the electron microscope in fixed material could not be considered sufficiently true to nature. Therefore, they weren't reliable for deducing the chemical composition and molecular architecture.

"It seems, therefore, that the dimensions and spacings shown in fixed material by the electron microscope cannot be considered sufficiently true to nature to permit us to deduce the chemical composition and molecular architecture of a certain structure by finding out, as recently proposed (Sjöstrand, 1953a, b), which particular kind of molecule would best fit a given spacing." (1956c, p. 132)

## Discuss the critical criterion that Palade used to evaluate the accuracy of micrographs, contrasting it with Sjöstrand's approach.

Palade emphasized consilience with results from other techniques, including other forms of microscopy and fractionation studies, as the critical criterion for evaluating micrograph accuracy. This meant aligning electron microscopy results with biochemical results to avoid conflicts. On the other hand, Sjöstrand focused on the detail within the micrograph itself.

## According to Rasmussen, how did Palade's strategy impact the relationship between electron microscopy and biochemistry? 

Rasmussen maintained that Palade's strategy minimized potential conflicts between electron microscopy and biochemistry by having the former focus on questions of arrangement and the latter on molecular structure and function. This approach garnered support from biochemists and led to greater success for Palade's methods over Sjöstrand's.

"Palade removed virtually all potential for conflict between the evidence from electron microscopy and that from biochemistry. The two experimental approaches spoke to separate domains: the former to questions of arrangement; the latter to questions of molecular structure and function" (p. 400).
