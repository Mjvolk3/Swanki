## How did the Elvehjem-Potter homogenizer function to break cell membranes?

The Elvehjem-Potter homogenizer worked by placing finely cut or minced tissue in a tube with a buffered salt solution and rotating a closely-fitting pestle up and down in the tube. This rotation created a shearing force as the faster-moving material near the pestle rubbed against the slower-moving material near the tube wall, breaking the cell membranes.

## Describe the fundamental assumption made by de Duve in estimating the damage caused by the Elvehjem-Potter homogenizer.

de Duve's fundamental assumption was that a given enzyme originated in a single organelle. Thus, he inferred that the fraction with the greatest enzyme concentration was the enzyme's locus in living cells, and any enzyme found in other fractions represented contamination.

## What does a clearance between tube and pestle affect in the function of the Elvehjem-Potter homogenizer?

The clearance between the tube and pestle affects the degree of disintegration of cells. Smaller clearance results in greater shearing force which aids better cell membrane disruption.

## What factors did Campbell and Epstein (1966) identify as influences on the effectiveness of cell disintegration in the Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer?

Campbell and Epstein identified several factors influencing cell disintegration: the clearance between the tube and pestle, the speed of rotation, and the number of times the pestle is moved up and down.
