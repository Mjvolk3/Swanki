## According to the paper, what should be done if results are not repeatable after replication attempts?

If results are not repeatable after replication attempts, it's highly likely that the observed pattern was a result of some unnoticed feature of the procedure, not the underlying phenomenon. It suggests that any determinacy in the pattern is procedural rather than phenomenological.

## What is the importance of comparing new technique results with already established techniques?

Comparing new technique results with those obtained through older, established techniques helps establish the credibility of the new method. This comparison is an application of the consilience of induction, where agreement between different sources of evidence supports the truth of a theory.

## What did John Baker insist on for validating results with cell fixation?

John Baker emphasized comparing results with cell fixation to those obtained from unfixed cells to validate accuracy. According to Baker, subjective ideas of what is good or bad should only be formed based on comparison with what is visible in the living, unaffected cell.
