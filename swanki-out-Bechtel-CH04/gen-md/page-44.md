## How does electron microscopy enhance the identification of cell components? 

Electron microscopy enhances the identificationof cell components by allowing scientists to identify parts of the cell that are much smaller than those identifiable by light microscopy. This offers a higher resolution and more detailed imagery.

## What is the primary advantage of cell fractionation over homogenates in biochemistry?

The primary advantage of cell fractionation is that it allows examination of units of a larger scale that can survive the homogenation process. This ensures structural and operational integrity during experiments.

## How can electron microscopy and cell fractionation be used together in research?

Electron microscopy and cell fractionation can be used together by examining fractions in the electron microscope. This allows researchers to relate the operational units identified by fractionation with component parts identified in the electron microscopy of whole cells.

## Explain how new scientific instruments can elevate cell-biology research. 

New scientific instruments like electron microscopy and cell fractionation elevate cell-biology research by revealing mechanisms responsible for cell phenomena. They enable the identification of small cell components and larger operational units, bridging the gap left by classical cytology and biochemistry.
