## Why is it necessary to remove water from a cell before placing it in an electron microscope?

In an electron microscope, cells need to be placed in a vacuum, which would cause water in the cells to vaporize and disrupt cell structures. Removing water stabilizes the specimen so that its shape is preserved during imaging.

## Explain the role of fixation in the preparation of specimens for electron microscopy.

Fixation involves the displacement of water and the formation of new chemical bonds, which stabilize the cell structures. This prevents disruption from both the removal of water and ongoing metabolic processes, preserving the morphology of the specimen.

## Discuss the problem caused by fixatives in terms of artifact generation, and relate it to Fischer's findings.

Fixatives can cause artifacts, which are misleading structures in cells due to the chemical treatments. Fischer found that different fixatives could generate structures in protein solutions that mimicked those observed in fixed cells, fueling concerns about the accuracy of such microscopy results.

## Why is staining necessary in electron microscopy, and how do fixatives contribute to this process?

Staining is necessary because cellular materials scatter electrons similarly due to their similar densities. Stains enhance electron scattering to create a distinct image. Many fixatives not only stabilize the cell but also enhance electron scattering, serving dual roles as fixatives and stains.
