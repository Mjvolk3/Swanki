## In the context of cell fractionation, what is the primary goal?

The primary goal of cell fractionation is to determine the chemical, especially enzymatic, composition of different cell organelles. This supports claims about the functions performed by those organelles.

## How can investigators use enzymatic composition to support claims about organelle functions?

Investigators analyze the enzymatic composition of different cell fractions to support claims about the functions performed by those organelles. Specific enzymes may indicate the presence of certain metabolic pathways or activities.

## A variable related to the proportion of a certain enzyme in a given organelle fraction can be denoted as $E$. If $C$ is the concentration of this enzyme and $V$ is the volume of the fraction, define a general equation representing the amount of enzyme present in the fraction.

The amount of enzyme present in the fraction, $E$, can be defined as:

$$
E = C \times V
$$

where:
- $C$ is the concentration of the enzyme
- $V$ is the volume of the fraction

This equation helps in calculating the total enzymatic content in the fraction.

## Describe a typical procedure used to create fractions by multiple centrifugations at increasing speeds.

A typical procedure for creating fractions involves multiple centrifugations at increasing speeds. Each step isolates different cellular components based on their size and density. Smaller, lighter components require higher centrifugal forces to be separated from the solution.
