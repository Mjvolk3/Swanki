## What challenge do scientists face when using fixatives in cell microscopy?

There is uncertainty in determining whether the structures observed in a fixed cell are representative of original cellular structures or artifacts introduced during the fixation process.

## How did Porter and Kallman (1953) propose to judge whether a cell had been well-fixed in a micrograph?

Porter and Kallman suggested that a well-fixed cell should not change shape detectably under the action of the fixative, and its cytoplasm should not show discontinuities and lacunae of irregular size and angular form under high resolution microscopy.

## What kind of empirical approach did Baker criticize regarding the development of fixative mixtures?

Baker commented that empirical approaches in cytological techniques, particularly in the invention of fixative mixtures, have been highly unregulated or run riot freely, implying a lack of systematic theoretical understanding.

## Describe one known mechanism of how osmium tetroxide functions as a fixative based on Gersh's explanation.

Osmium tetroxide operates as a fixative by oxidizing aliphatic and aromatic double bonds, sulfhydryl groups, alcoholic hydroxyl groups, and some amines. It also shows an affinity for certain nitrogenous groups. Bridging occurs at the sites of oxidation of adjacent hydroxyl or ethylenic groups by reduced osmium.
