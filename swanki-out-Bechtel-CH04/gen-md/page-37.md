## What did Porter and Kallman discover about the effect of extending the time of osmium fixation from ten minutes to sixteen hours?

Porter and Kallman discovered that with longer osmium fixation times, "the formed bodies (the majority limited by membranes) become more sharply defined, while the diffuse and frequently fibrous components of the ground substance are removed." This suggests that the materials of the matrix are decomposed to a state that allows them to diffuse out of the cell.

## What hypothesis did Porter and Kallman propose in 1953 regarding the effect of osmium fixation?

In 1953, Porter and Kallman proposed that the removal of diffuse and fibrous components during osmium fixation is due to the decomposition of matrix materials to a state that allows them to diffuse out of the cell.

## What were the findings of Palade's 1952b study on osmium fixation at different $\mathrm{pH}$ values?

Palade (1952b) found that unbuffered osmium resulted in acidity upon first contact with cell tissue. However, it was observed that osmium buffered with an appropriate solution maintained a more stable $\mathrm{pH}$ during the fixation process.

## According to Porter and Kallman, what was the effect of osmium tetroxide treatment on albumin and fibrinogen?

Porter and Kallman reported that osmium tetroxide treatment initially caused the formation of a gel in both albumin and fibrinogen, which subsequently returned to a liquid state. They argued this corresponded to the initial staining of various materials followed by the removal of the fibrous components in osmium-fixed cells.
