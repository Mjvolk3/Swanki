## How thick could microtomes designed for light microscopy generally cut sections, and why was this problematic for electron microscopy?

Microtomes designed for light microscopy could generally cut sections that were $1-2 \, \mathrm{mm}$ thick. This thickness was problematic for electron microscopy because it was nearly an order of magnitude too thick.

## What technological innovation did Fullam and Albert Gessler develop to address the issue of cutting thin sections for electron microscopy?

Fullam and Albert Gessler developed a microtome that worked at $57{,}000 \, \mathrm{rpm}$ and produced a cutting speed of $1{,}100 \, \mathrm{feet}$ per second.

## What specific physical process occurring at the cutting edge of the knife introduces large shearing stresses in both the section and the face of the block during microtomy?

The knife edge with a large included angle introduces large shearing stresses in both the section and the face of the block as it rakes across the surface. This is partly reversed as the section spreads out on the surface of the aqueous acetone or dioxane, but the uniformity of the spreading, especially on a micro-scale, is not well understood.

## What are some alternative approaches to traditional microtomes for preparing thin sections suitable for electron microscopy?

Alternative approaches to traditional microtomes included:
1. Cutting wedge-shaped sections that would be sufficiently thin on one edge for electron microscopy.
2. Reducing the transmission ratio on standard microtomes.
