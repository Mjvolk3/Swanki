## Please explain the significance of de Duve's postulate: "a given enzyme belongs to a single intracellular component in the living cell" in relation to cell fractionation.

This postulate by de Duve implies that any specific enzyme is restricted to one type of organelle within the cell. As a result, this assumption allows researchers to identify and characterize subcellular components through tissue fractionation. When an enzyme marker is found predominantly in a specific fraction, that fraction is considered to contain the organelle where this enzyme resides.

## Describe the implications de Duve's postulates have on the methodology of tissue fractionation experiments.

Granting de Duve's postulates, especially that of biological homogeneity, essentially means using enzymes as markers for their host particles. Researchers can treat suspensions of ground cells or tissues as mixtures of different populations of physical entities to be identified, characterized, resolved, and purified, driven solely by the presence of marker enzymes. Morphological examination after sufficient purification verifies the validity of these assumptions.

## Why did some investigators object to the assumptions of de Duve's postulates in cell fractionation studies?

Not every investigator accepted de Duve's assumptions about the organization of cells. The major objections were that these postulates assume a specific design principle without independent verification, making them seem overly reliant on fractionation as a method. Critics argued for confirmation from other methods, such as histochemical staining, to validate the localization of cellular components.

## Explain Glick's approach to validating the results of cell fractionation studies.

David Glick advocated using quantitative histochemical methods as an independent means to validate the localization of enzymes found through cell fractionation. By staining and observing tissues directly, researchers could attain confirmation beyond the reliance on centrifugal separation, thereby providing additional evidence for the specific localization of chemical constituents within cell structures.
