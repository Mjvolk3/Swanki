## Explain the disadvantages of the nonaqueous method in the context of cell fractionation.

The nonaqueous method for cell fractionation, although having the advantage of being able to study certain structures like the nucleus, had notable disadvantages. The primary disadvantage was that the drying process used chemical agents that could inactivate many enzymes researchers were targeting. This made the nonaqueous method less suitable for studying cytoplasmic structures where enzyme activity plays a critical role.

## Define the role of lysosomes in cell fractionation and explain why their membranes must remain intact during cell homogenization.

Lysosomes are cellular organelles that contain hydrolytic enzymes, such as acid phosphatase, which are capable of breaking down other cell organelles. If the lysosome membranes are breached during cell homogenization, these enzymes could rapidly destroy the cell organelles under investigation, leading to inaccurate results in cell fractionation studies.

## Why was the Waring blender ruled out for breaking cell membranes in cell fractionation?

The Waring blender was ruled out in cell fractionation because it was too aggressive and could potentially destroy both cell membranes and the membranes of internal organelles. This was problematic since internal organelles need to remain intact to prevent the redistribution of enzymes and maintain the structural and functional integrity of the samples being studied.

## Describe the primary objective and challenge of breaking cell membranes in cell fractionation.

The primary objective in cell fractionation is to quickly and efficiently break cell membranes without damaging the membranes of internal organelles. This is crucial because breaking internal organelle membranes can lead to enzyme redistribution and the potential destruction of sensitive structures such as lysosomes, which contain hydrolytic enzymes.
