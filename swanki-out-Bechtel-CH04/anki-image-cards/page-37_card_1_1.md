Explain the role of osmium fixation in preparing cellular structures for electron microscopy.

%

Osmium fixation is used to stain cellular structures by reacting with the lipids in cell membranes, enhancing the contrast and making structures like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes more visible under electron microscopy.

What is the primary difference in visualizing cell structures between permanganate staining and freeze-drying?

%

Permanganate staining provides a high-contrast image by oxidizing and staining cellular components, whereas freeze-drying preserves the cellular architecture without the artifacts that staining might introduce, often resulting in a clearer but less detailed image.
