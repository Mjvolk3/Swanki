The following cellular components can be seen in greater detail with electron microscopy:
- Secretion vesicles
- Chromatin within a nucleus
- Nuclear sap
- Nucleolus
- Mitochondria
- Lipid molecules
- Cell membrane
- Basophil substance
- Golgi complex
- Cell center (potentially referring to the centrosome)

Electron microscopy reveals intricate subcellular organelles and molecular complexes with much higher resolution compared to light microscopy.
