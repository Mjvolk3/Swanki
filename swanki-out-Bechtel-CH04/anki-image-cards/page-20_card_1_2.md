1. Homogenization: Suspending cells in an isotonic sucrose solution to preserve organelles.
2. First centrifugation (700 x g, 10 minutes): Separates larger cellular debris from the rest of the cellular components forming Sediment I.
3. Second centrifugation (5000 x g, 10 minutes): Separates mitochondria resulting in Sediment II.
4. Redispersion: Washing and removing contaminants from Sediment II.
5. Third centrifugation (24,000 x g, 10 minutes): Purification of mitochondria.
6. Fourth centrifugation (54,000 x g, 60 minutes): Separates microsomes in Sediment III, with remaining supernatant containing soluble materials.

## What is the purpose of increasing centrifugation speeds during cell fractionation?

Increasing centrifugation speeds separates cellular components based on their size and density. Larger and heavier particles sediment out first at lower speeds, while smaller and lighter components require higher speeds to sediment.
