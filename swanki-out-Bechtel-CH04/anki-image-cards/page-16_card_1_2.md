Different homogenizers vary in design to create unique shearing forces. Examples include:
- A: Pestle with a cross-shaped end and flared tube opening.
- B: Pestle and tube with a constriction in the middle.
- C: Thin pestle with a textured end, in a straight tube.
- D: Various lengths and diameters without additional features.
- E: Pestle with a helical base to increase shearing forces.
- F: Straight pestles and tubes with no additional features.
- G: Pestle and tube with a bulb in the middle.
- H: T-shaped handle pestle and conical tube.
- I: Mechanically turned pestle with a coiled base and tube with a side arm.

### How is a pestle with a helical or coiled structure at its base (type E) advantageous in cell fractionation?

A pestle with a helical or coiled structure increases the shearing forces which are more effective in disrupting cell walls and membranes, facilitating better cell fractionation.
