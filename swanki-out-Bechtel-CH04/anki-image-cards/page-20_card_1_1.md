1. **Homogenization**: Cells are broken open in an isotonic sucrose solution using a device like a homogenizer.
2. **First centrifugation (700 x g, 10 minutes)**: Larger cellular debris, such as intact cells and nuclei, sediment at the bottom, forming Sediment I, while other components remain in the supernatant.
3. **Second centrifugation (5000 x g, 10 minutes)**: Supernatant from the first centrifugation is spun at a higher speed, resulting in sedimentation of mitochondria into Sediment II.

##What components are typically found after the third and fourth centrifugation steps in the cell fractionation process depicted in Figure 4.3?

1. **Third centrifugation (24,000 x g, 10 minutes)**: After this step, the pellet contains purified mitochondria previously redispersed from Sediment II.
2. **Fourth centrifugation (54,000 x g, 60 minutes)**: This high-speed step results in microsomes found in Sediment III, and the remaining supernatant contains soluble materials from the homogenate.
