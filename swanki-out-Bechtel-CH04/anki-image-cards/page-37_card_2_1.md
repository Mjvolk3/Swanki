Osmium fixation, as shown in the schematic diagram, preserves cellular structures such as mitochondria (M), endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and ribosomes (r) with high definition and clarity. Percmanate staining offers varying levels of contrast and preservation, while freeze-drying typically presents less detail or a different structural pattern compared to the chemical fixatives.

## What does the third image in the comparison suggest about the effects of freeze-drying on cellular structures?

The third image suggests that freeze-drying results in a different pattern of visualization for cellular components such as mitochondria (M), endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and ribosomes (r), likely presenting less detail or altered structural integrity in comparison to osmium fixation and permanganate staining.
