The image is a schematic representation of a cell and its various organelles and structures, as seen through electron microscopy. It includes labels for cellular components such as secretion vesicles, chromatin, nuclear sap, nucleolus, mitochondria, lipid molecules, cell membrane, basophil substance, Golgi complex, and the cell center (centrosome). It illustrates the superior level of detail that electron microscopy provides compared to light microscopy, enabling visualization of intricate subcellular organelles and molecular complexes.
