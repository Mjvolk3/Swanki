The different staining and preparation techniques, including osmium fixation, permanganate staining, and freeze-drying, affect cellular structures such as mitochondria (M), endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and ribosomes (r) in various ways:
- **Osmium Fixation:** Provides high contrast for lipid-containing structures, preserving cellular membranes well.
- **Permanganate Staining:** Generally used for enhancing contrast in polysaccharide-containing structures.
- **Freeze-Drying:** Preserves ultrasensitive structural details but may offer lower contrast compared to heavy metal stains.

The cellular structures affected by the staining techniques illustrated in the schematic comparison are:
- **Mitochondria (M)**
- **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)**
- **Ribosomes (r)**

These structures show varying appearances depending on whether they have undergone osmium fixation, permanganate staining, or freeze-drying.
