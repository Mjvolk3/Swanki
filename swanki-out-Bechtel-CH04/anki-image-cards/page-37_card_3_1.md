The image illustrates the effects of three different preparation techniques—osmium fixation, permanganate staining, and freeze-drying—on cellular components like mitochondria (M), endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and ribosomes (r), as observed in electron microscopy. The comparison helps in understanding how each technique differently preserves or highlights various cellular structures.
