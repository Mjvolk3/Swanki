Homogenizers are used for lysing cells and disrupting their membranes to isolate subcellular components. They function by using a pestle inserted into a tube, which is then moved up and down to create shearing forces that break cell walls and membranes.

The image displays various homogenizers, each with unique designs:
- **A**: Pestle with a cross-shaped end, fitting into a flared tube.
- **B**: Classical pestle and tube with a mid-constriction.
- **C**: Thin pestle with a textured end inserted into a straight tube.
- **D**: Different lengths and diameters without additional features.
- **E**: Pestle with a helical structure at its base.
- **F**: Simple straight pestles and tubes.
- **G**: Pestle and tube with a bulb in the middle of the tube.
- **H**: Pestle with T-shaped handle and conical tube.
- **I**: Complex design with a mechanical gear, coiled pestle base, and tube with a side arm.
