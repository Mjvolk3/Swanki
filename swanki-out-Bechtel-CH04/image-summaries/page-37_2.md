ChatGPT figure/image summary: The first image is a schematic diagram showing the effects of staining with osmium fixation on cellular structures such as mitochondria (M), endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and ribosomes (r). The structures appear well-defined and preserved.

The second image represents the effects of staining with permanganate on similar cellular structures. The contrast or preservation levels may be different compared to the osmium fixation.

The third image depicts the effects of freeze-drying on the same cellular components. The visualization might present less detail or a different pattern in comparison to the chemical fixatives.

The images are likely simplifications intended to demonstrate the differences in structural details that are visible when cells are prepared using each of these three methods.
