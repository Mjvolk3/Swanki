ChatGPT figure/image summary: The first image (Figure 4.1) is an optical illusion created by Roger N. Shepard to illustrate how our visual perception can be tricked. The image appears to show two table-like shapes, and the reader is asked to consider whether the shaded surfaces of these shapes are identical. Although they may appear to be different due to the perspective and context of the drawing, the shaded surfaces are typically designed to be the same shape in such illusionsâ€”this effect is used to demonstrate how context and perspective can influence perception.

The second image (Figure 4.3) is a schematic representation of a typical procedure for creating fractions by multiple centrifugations at increasing speeds. The graph might indicate sequential steps in centrifugation, where after each step, a specific fraction is obtained, and the remaining suspension is subjected to further centrifugation at a higher speed to separate more components based on their densities. This type of fractionation is commonly used in biochemistry and cell biology to isolate different organelles and molecular complexes from cells.
