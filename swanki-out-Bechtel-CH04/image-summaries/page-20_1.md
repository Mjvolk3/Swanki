ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image you've provided is a schematic representation of a typical procedure for cell fractionation by successive differential centrifugations. The process is used to separate and purify the different components of a cell. Here's what is depicted in the steps of the diagram:

1. Homogenization: This step involves breaking open the cells in a solution, typically isotonic sucrose, to preserve the organelles. The device shown could be a homogenizer which is used to physically break up the cells.

2. First centrifugation (700 x g, 10 minutes): The initial centrifugation step separates larger cellular debris, like intact cells and nuclei, from the rest of the cellular components by spinning at relatively low speed. These large components sediment at the bottom of the tube, forming Sediment I, while the other components remain in the supernatant.

3. Second centrifugation (5000 x g, 10 minutes): The supernatant from the first centrifugation is further centrifuged at a higher speed. This results in the sedimentation of the mitochondria, which are then found in Sediment II.

4. Redispersion: The mitochondria from Sediment II are then redispersed, likely to wash them and remove any remaining contaminants.

5. Third centrifugation (24,000 x g, 10 minutes): Upon spinning at an even higher speed, further separation occurs. After this step, the pellet (Sediment II after washing) contains purified mitochondria.

6. Fourth centrifugation (54,000 x g, 60 minutes): Finally, an even higher speed centrifugation is performed. This step results in a separation where microsomes are found in Sediment III, and the remaining supernatant contains soluble materials from the homogenate.

Each step involves centrifuging the substance at a certain speed (measured in times gravity [x g]) for a certain duration (measured in minutes). The different speeds allow for separation of components based on their size and density, with heavier and larger particles sedimenting out of the suspension first. This diagram is used to illustrate a standard lab procedure for fractionating cells' organelles for further study of their structure and function.
