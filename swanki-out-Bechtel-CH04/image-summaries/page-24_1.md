ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided appears to be a schematic representation of a cell and its various organelles and structures, as seen through electron microscopy. The diagram includes labels for the following cellular components:

- Secretion vesicles
- Chromatin within a nucleus
- Nuclear sap
- Nucleolus
- Mitochondria
- Lipid molecules
- Cell membrane
- Basophil substance
- Golgi complex
- Cell center (possibly referring to the centrosome)

The image illustrates the greater level of detail about cell structures that can be observed using electron microscopy compared to light microscopy. With electron microscopy, the internal composition of the cell can be visualized with much higher resolution, revealing intricate subcellular organelles and molecular complexes. This type of imaging has been especially significant in the field of cell biology and has greatly advanced our understanding of cell structure and function.
