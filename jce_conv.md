\begin{abstract}
The Journal of Chemical Education announces a call for papers for an upcoming special issue on Teaching Innovation in Materials Science and Engineering Design．This issue aims to highlight innovative approaches in teaching materials science and engineering，with a focus on integrating design principles，sustainability，and artificial intelligence into educational programs．
\end{abstract}

KEYWORDS：Materials Education，Design Engineering，Sustainability，Artificial Intelligence in Education，Innovative Teaching Methods， Industry－Academia Collaboration

\section*{－INTRODUCTION}

The field of materials science and engineering is rapidly evolving，driven by technological advancements，environmental concerns，and the need for sustainable practices．As such， education in this field must adapt to prepare the next generation of scientists and engineers to meet these challenges． The Asian Materials and Design Education Symposium （AMDES）has been at the forefront of promoting innovative methods in materials education at the university level， complementing its counterparts：\({ }^{1}\) the International Materials Education Symposium（IMES）\({ }^{2}\) at the University of Cam－ bridge and the North American Materials Education Symposium（NAMES）．\({ }^{3}\)

AMDES distinguishes itself by incorporating elements of engineering design alongside materials education，providing a unique platform for educators，researchers，and industry professionals．This approach recognizes the increasing importance of integrating design thinking and problem－solving skills into materials education，preparing students for the complexities of real－world applications．

Despite the significant progress made in materials education， there remains a gap between traditional teaching methods and the rapidly changing needs of industry and society．This special issue aims to bridge this gap by showcasing cutting－edge research and innovative teaching methods that address current and future challenges in materials science and engineering education．For example，many materials science programs struggle to balance foundational science with hands－on， industry－relevant skills，particularly in rapidly advancing fields． Another common challenge is integrating fast－evolving technologies，such as machine learning and sustainable materials，often hindered by resource limitations．Additionally， many programs face difficulties in assessing critical skills such as design thinking and interdisciplinary problem－solving．

\section*{－SPECIAL ISSUE SCOPE AND CONTENT}

This special issue on Teaching Innovation in Materials Science and Engineering Design invites contributions from both the academic and industrial sectors of the materials community．

We seek to highlight novel teaching approaches and research in materials education and design education while offering a platform to exchange best practices for incorporating sustainability and artificial intelligence（AI）into educational programs．This would very likely lead to greater employability of students in both the materials and engineering design spaces as these innovations translate to better student career readiness．

We encourage authors to present their innovative teaching strategies and discuss the impact these approaches have had on students＇attitudes toward learning materials chemistry，their views on laboratory work，or their understanding of new concepts．Potential topics for manuscripts may include，but are not limited to，one or more of the following key areas that will shape the future of materials and design for education：

1．AI in Teaching and Learning
－Implementation of AI tools for personalized learning in materials science
－Machine learning applications in materials discov－ ery and their integration into curriculum
－AI－assisted laboratory experiments and data analysis
2．Integrating Sustainability into the Curriculum
－Case studies on incorporating life cycle assess－ ment in materials selection courses
－Teaching methodologies for sustainable materials design
－Integration of circular economy principles in materials engineering education
3．Innovative Assessment Design
－Project－based learning approaches in materials education

\section*{SUBMISSION, REVIEW, AND PUBLICATION PROCESS}

Manuscripts should align with the principles outlined in the Author Guidelines for the Journal of Chemical Education \({ }^{4}\) and can be submitted using any of the manuscript types listed. Authors are strongly encouraged to use the JCE-specific manuscript template, which contains prompts for required manuscript components; using the manuscript template aids in creating documents that are easier to review and publish. Authors considering submission of manuscripts to be considered chemical education research should take note of the content requirements outlined by the Journal. \({ }^{6}\)

Manuscripts should be submitted to the Journal of Chemical Education through the online manuscript submission portal ACS Paragon Plus \({ }^{7}\) by June 1, 2025, to receive full consideration for publication in the special issue anticipated to post in late 2025. When submitting your manuscript in the Paragon system, select "Teaching Innovation in Materials Science and Engineering Design" under the Special Issue Selection during "Step 1: Type, Title, \& Abstract". Authors should also indicate in the cover letter during "Step 6: Details \& Comments" that the manuscript is submitted for publication in the Special Issue: Teaching Innovation in Materials Science and Engineering Design.

As with all ACS journals, papers intended for the special issue will be available ASAP (as soon as publishable) online as soon as they are accepted and proofs have been checked. After appearing as an ASAP article, the paper will be published on a rolling basis in the next available regular issue of the Journal of Chemical Education. Once all invited articles have appeared online, they will be assembled into a single online Special Issue, which will provide the work of each author additional exposure.

\section*{GUEST EDITORS}

The themed issue will be curated by ZhiLi Dong, Arlindo Silva, Teik-Cheng Lim, Leonard W. T. Ng, and Rui A. Gonçalves.
