## What is the nature of the classes $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ in classification problems?

In the most common scenario, the classes $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ are taken to be disjoint, so that each input is assigned to one and only one class.

## What is the probability of a mistake occurring when classifying $\mathbf{x}$ into classes $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$?

The probability of a mistake is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p(\text{mistake}) & = p\left(\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{R}_{1}, \mathcal{C}_{2}\right) + p\left(\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{R}_{2}, \mathcal{C}_{1}\right) \\
& = \int_{\mathcal{R}_{1}} p\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{C}_{2}\right) \, d\mathbf{x} + \int_{\mathcal{R}_{2}} p\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{C}_{1}\right) \, d\mathbf{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

This equation represents the sum of the probabilities of $\mathbf{x}$ being in region $\mathcal{R}_{1}$ but actually belonging to $\mathcal{C}_{2}$, and $\mathbf{x}$ being in region $\mathcal{R}_{2}$ but actually belonging to $\mathcal{C}_{1}$.

- #probability, #classification-errors

---

## How can we minimize the probability of making a mistake in classification between two classes?

We should assign $\mathbf{x}$ to the class where the posterior probability is larger. Specifically, for $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{2}$:

$$
\text{Assign } \mathbf{x} \text{ to } \mathcal{C}_{1} \text{ if } p\left(\mathcal{C}_{1} \mid \mathbf{x}\right) > p\left(\mathcal{C}_{2} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)
$$

Using the product rule of probability:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) = p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right) p(\mathbf{x})
$$

Because $p(\mathbf{x})$ is common to both terms, the minimum probability of making a mistake is obtained if each $\mathbf{x}$ is assigned to the class for which $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$ is largest.

- #probability, #classification, #minimization

---

## What is the method to maximize the probability of being correct in classification for $K$ classes?

The probability of being correct is given by:

$$
p(\text{correct}) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} p\left(\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{R}_{k}, \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \int_{\mathcal{R}_{k}} p\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) \, d\mathbf{x}
$$

This is maximized when each $\mathbf{x}$ is assigned to the class having the largest posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$.

- #probability, #classification, #maximization

---

## What is a loss function in the context of decision theory, and why is it important?

A loss function, also called a cost function, is a measure of the loss incurred in making a decision. It allows us to formalize and quantify different consequences of decisions, helping us to minimize the total loss incurred. It is particularly important in applications where different types of mistakes have different consequences, such as in medical diagnosis.

For instance, misclassifying a healthy patient as having cancer poses less risk than misclassifying a cancer patient as healthy.

- #decision-theory, #loss-function, #cost

---

## Why might minimizing the number of misclassifications not always be the best objective?

Minimizing the number of misclassifications does not account for the different consequences of different types of mistakes. For example, in medical diagnosis, diagnosing a patient with cancer as healthy has far more severe consequences than diagnosing a healthy patient as having cancer. Therefore, we need to consider a loss function that takes these different impacts into account.

- #decision-theory, #misclassification, #loss

---

## How can we use the posterior probability in classification to devise an optimal decision rule?

Using the product rule $p\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) = p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right) p(\mathbf{x})$ and noting that $p(\mathbf{x})$ is common to all terms, the decision rule is:

Assign $\mathbf{x}$ to the class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ for which the posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$ is largest.

This minimizes the probability of making a mistake and maximizes the probability of being correct.

- #decision-theory, #classification, #posterior-probability

## What are the joint probabilities $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{k})$ used for in the context of decision boundary illustration?

The joint probabilities $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{k})$ for each class are plotted against $x$ to determine the optimal decision boundary denoted by $\widehat{x}$. The goal is to minimize the misclassification rate by varying $\widehat{x}$ such that the posterior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid x)$ are maximized for each class. 

- #probability, #classification.boundary, #misclassification.rate

## Describe the error contributions in regions $x<\widehat{x}$ and $x\geqslant \widehat{x}$ for the decision boundary $\widehat{x}$.

For $x<\widehat{x}$, the errors arise from points belonging to class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ being misclassified as $\mathcal{C}_{1}$, which is represented by the sum of the red and green regions. Conversely, for $x\geqslant \widehat{x}$, the errors arise from points belonging to class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ being misclassified as $\mathcal{C}_{2}$, represented by the blue region.

- #classification, #errors.regions, #misclassifications.boundary

## How does the combined area of the blue and green regions behave with varying $\widehat{x}$?

As $\widehat{x}$ varies (indicated by the red double-headed arrow), the combined area of the blue and green regions remains constant, while the size of the red region varies. This reflects the trade-off between different types of misclassifications.

- #probability, #classification.trade-off, #constant.area

## What is the significance of the decision boundary $\widehat{x}=x_{0}$?

The decision boundary $\widehat{x}=x_{0}$ is significant as it is the point where the curves for $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{1})$ and $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{2})$ cross, eliminating the red region and thus achieving the minimum misclassification rate. This boundary ensures that each value of $x$ is assigned to the class with the higher posterior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid x)$.

- #classification, #optimal.boundary, #misclassification.minimization

## What decision rule minimizes the misclassification rate?

The minimum misclassification rate decision rule assigns each value of $x$ to the class with the higher posterior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid x)$. This optimal choice for boundary, $\widehat{x}$, occurs where the joint probabilities $p\left(x, \mathcal{C}_{1}\right)$ and $p\left(x, \mathcal{C}_{2}\right)$ intersect.

- #decision.rule, #misclassification.rate, #posterior.probabilities

## What happens to the red region at the optimal decision boundary $\widehat{x}=x_{0}$?

At the optimal decision boundary $\widehat{x}=x_{0}$, where the curves for $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{1})$ and $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{2})$ intersect, the red region, which represents the misclassification of class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ as $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ for $x<\widehat{x}$, disappears, thereby reducing the misclassification rate to its minimum.

## Anki Card 1

What are the joint probabilities \( p(x, \mathcal{C}_{k}) \) and how do they define the decision region in the context of two-class classification?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_7631da1ff57256b30effg-1.jpg?height=645&width=1258&top_left_y=227&top_left_x=270)

%

Joint probabilities \( p(x, \mathcal{C}_{k}) \) are used to define decision regions for two-class classification by plotting them against the input variable \( x \). The decision boundary \( x = \widehat{x} \) separates the two regions: 
- \( x \geq \widehat{x} \): classified as class \( \mathcal{C}_{2} \) (decision region \( \mathcal{R}_{2} \))
- \( x < \widehat{x} \): classified as class \( \mathcal{C}_{1} \) (decision region \( \mathcal{R}_{1} \))

Classification errors arise from overlapping distributions:
- For \( x < \widehat{x} \), errors occur when class \( \mathcal{C}_{2} \) is misclassified as \( \mathcal{C}_{1} \) (red and green areas).
- For \( x \geq \widehat{x} \), errors occur when class \( \mathcal{C}_{1} \) is misclassified as \( \mathcal{C}_{2} \) (blue area).

## Anki Card 2

Explain the impact and optimization of the decision boundary \( x = \widehat{x} \) in minimizing classification errors in a two-class problem.

%

The decision boundary \( x = \widehat{x} \) is critical in minimizing classification errors in a two-class problem. The boundary is optimized at the point where the two class probability distributions intersect. This intersection, denoted \( x = x_{0} \), achieves the most accurate classification by ensuring values of \( x \geq x_{0} \) are assigned to class \( \mathcal{C}_{2} \) and values of \( x < x_{0} \) are assigned to class \( \mathcal{C}_{1} \).

Optimization results:
- Minimized overlapping region (red region disappears).
- The decision rule ensures classification corresponds to the highest posterior probability \( p(\mathcal{C}_{k} | x) \) for each \( x \).

## What does the schematic illustration of joint probabilities p(x, \mathcal{C}_k) for two classes tell us about the decision boundary and classification errors?

%

Figure 5.5 illustrates the joint probabilities $p(x, \mathcal{C}_1)$ and $p(x, \mathcal{C}_k)$ for two classes plotted against input variable $x$, showing two decision regions $\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\mathcal{R}_2$, separated by a boundary at $x=\widehat{x}$. Errors occur in the blue, green, and red regions. For $x<\widehat{x}$, errors are due to class $\mathcal{C}_2$ being misclassified as $\mathcal{C}_1$ (red and green regions). For $x\geqslant\widehat{x}$, errors are due to class $\mathcal{C}_1$ being misclassified as $\mathcal{C}_2$ (blue region).

## What impact does optimizing the decision boundary have on classification errors according to the schematic illustration?

%

Optimizing the decision boundary to $x = x_0$ (where the two probability distributions cross) minimizes classification errors. Post-optimization (Figure 5.5b), values of $x \geqslant x_0$ are assigned to class $\mathcal{C}_2$ and values of $x < x_0$ to class $\mathcal{C}_1$, corresponding to the highest posterior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_k|x)$ for each $x$.

## What is illustrated in Figure 5.5 regarding the classification and errors of two classes against the input variable $x$?

% 

Figure 5.5 illustrates the joint probabilities $p\left(x, \mathcal{C}_{k}\right)$ for each of two classes plotted against $x$, and highlights the decision boundary $x=\widehat{x}$. The figure shows that:
- Values of $x \geqslant \widehat{x}$ are classified as class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$, belonging to decision region $\mathcal{R}_{2}$.
- Values of $x < \widehat{x}$ are classified as class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$, belonging to decision region $\mathcal{R}_{1}$.

Errors, represented by shaded regions under the curves, arise:
- For $x < \widehat{x}$, errors are due to class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ instances misclassified as $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ (sum of the red and green regions).
- For $x \geqslant \widehat{x}$, errors are due to class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ instances misclassified as $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ (blue region).

The goal is to choose $\widehat{x}$ to minimize classification errors.

## Where do classification errors occur in the decision boundary illustration of Figure 5.5?

%

Classification errors in Figure 5.5 occur in the shaded regions:
- For $x < \widehat{x}$, errors are due to points from class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ being misclassified as $\mathcal{C}_{1}$, represented by the red and green areas.
- For $x \geqslant \widehat{x}$, errors are due to points from class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ being misclassified as $\mathcal{C}_{2}$, represented by the blue area.

The optimal decision boundary $\widehat{x}$ aims to minimize these errors.

What is the significance of the decision boundary $x = \widehat{x}$ in the context of the joint probabilities $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{k})$ for two classes?

%

The decision boundary $x = \widehat{x}$ is the point that divides the input variable space into two decision regions: $\mathcal{R}_{1}$ for class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ (for values of $x < \widehat{x}$) and $\mathcal{R}_{2}$ for class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ (for values of $x \geqslant \widehat{x}$). This boundary is chosen to minimize the classification errors, with the errors for $x < \widehat{x}$ due to class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ instances being misclassified as class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ (represented by the sum of the red and green regions), and for $x \geqslant \widehat{x}$ due to class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ instances being misclassified as $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ (represented by the blue region).

What do the colored regions under the curves $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{1})$ and $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{2})$ represent in the joint probability graph?

%

The colored regions under the curves represent classification errors:

- The green shaded area represents errors due to instances from class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ being misclassified as $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ when $x < \widehat{x}$.
- The red shaded area also represents errors from class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ misclassified as $\mathcal{C}_{1}$.
- The blue shaded area represents errors due to instances from class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ being misclassified as $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ when $x \geqslant \widehat{x}$.

These regions illustrate the trade-offs made in setting the decision boundary $x = \widehat{x}$ to minimize the overall classification errors.

- #machine-learning, #error-analysis, #classification

## What does the loss matrix represent in a classification problem, such as the cancer treatment problem?

The loss matrix, denoted as $L_{kj}$, represents the penalty or "loss" we incur when assigning a sample $\mathbf{x}$ belonging to the true class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ to a predicted class $\mathcal{C}_{j}$.

In the context of a cancer treatment problem:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\text{  } & \text{ Diagnosed Normal} & \text{ Diagnosed Cancer} \\
\text{True Normal} & 0 & 1 \\
\text{True Cancer} & 100 & 0 \\
\end{array} \right)
$$

This matrix captures the cost of misclassification, with $L_{kj}$ indicating the loss when the true class is $k$ and it is classified as $j$.

- #machine-learning, #classification, #loss-matrix

## What is the goal in minimizing the loss function in a classification problem?

The objective is to minimize the expected loss $\mathbb{E}[L]$, considering the true class is unknown. The expected loss is calculated by averaging with respect to the joint probability distribution $p\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{C}_{k}\right)$:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L] = \sum_{k} \sum_{j} \int_{\mathcal{R}_{j}} L_{kj} p\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}
$$

This involves selecting decision regions $\mathcal{R}_{j}$ for each input vector $\mathbf{x}$ to minimize this expected loss.

- #machine-learning, #loss-optimization, #probability

## How can the product rule be used to simplify the decision rule that minimizes expected loss in classification?

Using the product rule for a joint probability distribution $p(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{C}_{k}) = p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}) p(\mathbf{x})$, we can eliminate the common factor $p(\mathbf{x})$ when minimizing the expected loss.

Thus, the decision rule assigns each new $\mathbf{x}$ to the class $j$ for which:

$$
\sum_{k} L_{kj} p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x})
$$

is minimized. This transforms the problem into minimizing a weighted sum of the posterior probabilities for the classes, weighted by the loss values.

- #machine-learning, #decision-rules, #probability

## What is the purpose of the reject option in classification tasks?

The reject option aims to reduce error by avoiding decisions in regions of high uncertainty, where the largest posterior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x})$ is not significantly large. This option improves accuracy by focusing on cases with higher certainty in classification.

For instance, in a cancer screening example, an automatic system might abstain from making uncertain diagnoses, thus potentially lowering the overall error rate.

- #machine-learning, #classification, #reject-option

## How is the reject option implemented in practice?

By defining a threshold $\theta$, below which we consider the decision uncertain, the reject option is implemented. If the largest posterior probability $\max_k p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}) < \theta$, we reject making a decision for $\mathbf{x}$.

This can be set up as:

$$
\text{Reject } \mathbf{x} \text{ if } \max_k p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}) < \theta
$$

This method is useful in scenarios where high accuracy is desirable by prioritizing certainty over coverage.

- #machine-learning, #classification, #thresholding

## Explain the trade-off involved in implementing the reject option.

The trade-off in using the reject option lies between reducing classification errors and the coverage of decisions. By rejecting uncertain cases, we can achieve lower error rates on accepted decisions, but at the cost of processing fewer instances.

This may be analytically expressed as:

$$
\text{Error rate reduction} \ \propto \ 1 - \ \text{Coverage} 
$$

Thus, the reject option must balance the need for accurate classification and the requirement to cover as many instances as possible while remaining reliable.

- #machine-learning, #classification, #tradeoffs

## How does introducing a threshold $\theta$ help in classification problems?

Introducing a threshold $\theta$ helps in classification problems by rejecting inputs $\mathbf{x}$ for which the largest posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$ is less than or equal to $\theta$. This allows the system to classify images with high confidence and reject ambiguous cases.

$$
\max_k \{ p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right) \} \leq \theta
$$

- #classification, #threshold, #decision-making

## Explain how the value of $\theta$ affects the fraction of examples rejected in a classification system.

Setting $\theta = 1$ will ensure that **all** examples are rejected, while setting $\theta < \frac{1}{K}$ (where $K$ is the number of classes) will ensure that **no** examples are rejected. Thus, the fraction of examples that are rejected is controlled by the value of $\theta$.

$$
\theta = \frac{1}{K} \quad \text{will ensure} \quad \text{no examples are rejected}
$$

- #classification, #threshold-control, #data-handling

## Describe the inference and decision stages in a classification problem.

In classification problems, the **inference stage** uses training data to learn a model for the posterior probabilities $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$. The **decision stage** uses these posterior probabilities to make optimal class assignments by comparing probabilities.

$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)
$$

- #classification, #inference, #decision-making

## What are the three distinct approaches to solving decision problems in classification, ranked by complexity?

The three approaches to solving decision problems are:

1. **Inference problem**: Determine the class-conditional densities $p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right)$. Infer prior probabilities $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)$. Use Bayes' theorem.

$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right) = \frac{p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)}{p(\mathbf{x})}
$$

2. **Direct mapping**: Learn a function that maps inputs $\mathbf{x}$ directly into decisions (discriminant function).
3. **Optimize expected loss**: Minimize expected loss using a loss matrix.

- #classification, #decision-approaches, #complexity

## What is a discriminant function in the context of classification?

A discriminant function is a function that maps inputs $\mathbf{x}$ directly into decisions. It bypasses the two-stage process of inferring posterior probabilities and then making a decision based on those probabilities.

$$
f(\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \text{Decision}
$$

- #classification, #discriminant-function, #decision-making

## How does Bayes' theorem apply to the classification decision stage?

In the decision stage, Bayes' theorem is used to find the posterior class probabilities from the class-conditional densities and prior probabilities:

$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right) = \frac{p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)}{p(\mathbf{x})}
$$

## Explain the reject option in the context of classification and posterior probability in Figure 5.7.

%

The reject option in classification is used to defer decisions for inputs $x$ where the largest posterior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_k \mid x)$ is less than or equal to a threshold $\theta$. This means that if neither class's posterior probability exceeds $\theta$, the classifier opts to reject the decision rather than risking an incorrect classification. This is visually represented in Figure 5.7, where the region below $\theta$ is marked as the "reject region".

What does the graph in Figure 5.7 illustrate regarding the reject option in classification?

%

The graph illustrates the use of a reject option in classification systems, where inputs $x$ are rejected if the larger of the two posterior probabilities $p(C_k \mid x)$ is less than or equal to a threshold $\theta$. This is shown by the "reject region" below the threshold $\theta$, indicating that values of $x$ within this region do not allow for a confident classification.

Explain the effect of setting different values for the threshold $\theta$ in the context of the reject option in classification.

%

Setting $\theta=1$ ensures that all examples are rejected because no posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$ can be greater than 1. Conversely, if there are $K$ classes, setting $\theta<1/K$ ensures that no examples are rejected since the largest posterior probability will always be greater than this threshold.

## Discuss Bayes' theorem in terms of the numerator's quantities.

Bayes' theorem can be found in terms of the quantities in the numerator using:
$$

$$

## Explain Approach (a) for solving classification problems.

Approach (a) involves finding the joint distribution over both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{k}$.

It includes the following steps:
1. Estimating class priors $p(\mathcal{C}_{k})$ 
2. Estimating class-conditional densities $p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k})$
3. Using these estimates to compute the marginal density $p(\mathbf{x})$

This allows for:
- Outlier or novelty detection
- Detection of new data points with low probabilities under the model

- #statistics, #machine-learning, #classification

## Explain Approach (b) and its computational advantages.

Approach (b) directly models the posterior class probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x})$.

Steps:
1. Solve the inference problem to determine $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x})$
2. Use decision theory to assign each new $\mathbf{x}$ to one of the classes

Advantages:
- Avoids estimating high-dimensional joint distributions
- Reduces computational resource requirements
- Focused directly on making classification decisions

- #machine-learning, #classification, #decision-theory

## Explain Approach (c) and its simplicity compared to (a) and (b).

Approach (c) finds a discriminant function $f(\mathbf{x})$ that maps each input $\mathbf{x}$ directly onto a class label.

Steps:
1. Train a model to find $f(\mathbf{x})$
2. Use $f(\mathbf{x})$ to directly get class labels for new inputs

Advantages:
- Integrates the inference and decision stages into a single step
- Simplifies the learning problem

Example:
For two-class problems, $f(\cdot)$ is binary-valued, where $f=0$ represents class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $f=1$ represents class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$.

## Discuss the relative merits of generative vs. discriminative approaches in machine learning.

Generative approaches (e.g., (a)):
- Model the input-output distribution
- Useful for tasks like outlier detection
- May require large training sets for high-dimensional $\mathbf{x}$

Discriminative approaches (e.g., (b)):
- Directly model posterior probabilities
- More efficient for classification tasks
- Avoid the complexity of modeling high-dimensional inputs

Many studies explore combining both approaches for robust machine learning solutions (e.g., Jebara, 2004; Lasserre, Bishop, Minka, 2006).

- #machine-learning, #generative-models, #discriminative-models

## Discuss how class priors $p(\mathcal{C}_{k})$ can be estimated and their role.

Class priors $p(\mathcal{C}_{k})$ often estimated from the fractions of the training set data points in each class.

Role:
- In generative models (e.g., (a)), combined with class-conditional densities to compute marginal density.
- Affect posterior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x})$ computed in Approach (b).

Example:
If class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ appears 30% of the time in training data, then $p(\mathcal{C}_{k}) = 0.3$.

- #statistics, #bayes-theorem, #machine-learning

## Discuss novelty detection and marginal density $p(\mathbf{x})$ in Approach (a).

Approach (a) allows for the determination of marginal density $p(\mathbf{x})$ using:
$$
p(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{k} p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)
$$

Applications:
- Detect new data points having low probability densities under the model.
- Useful for novelty or outlier detection.

## What is the loss matrix and how is it used in minimizing risk?

The loss matrix in decision theory contains elements representing the cost or penalty for making incorrect decisions. To minimize risk, we must often revise elements in the loss matrix. 

Equation (5.23) allows one to modify the minimum risk decision criterion if we have access to posterior probabilities. 

- #machine-learning, #classification.loss-matrix

---

## Describe the decision boundary in the context of class-conditional densities.

The decision boundary in $x$ that minimizes the misclassification rate assuming equal prior class probabilities is represented by a vertical green line.

- #machine-learning, #classification.decision-boundary

---

## Explain the importance we gain by having access to posterior probabilities even if we use them to make decisions later.

Having access to posterior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_k \mid \mathbf{x})$ allows revising the minimum risk decision easily by modifying the loss matrix. It helps in determining a rejection criterion and compensating for class priors to minimize misclassification rates or expected loss.

- #machine-learning, #probability.posterior-probabilities

---

## How can posterior probabilities aid in determining a rejection criterion?

Posterior probabilities allow determining a rejection criterion that minimizes the misclassification rate or, more generally, the expected loss for a given fraction of rejected data points. 

- #machine-learning, #probability.rejection-criterion

---

## Why is it important to compensate for class priors?

In scenarios like cancer screening where the class priors are heavily imbalanced, compensating for class priors ensures a more accurate system performance. E.g., if only $1$ in $1000$ examples corresponds to cancer, training data collected from the general population must be balanced to avoid high false-negative rates.

- #machine-learning, #classification.class-priors

---

## What happens if we only use a discriminant function without posterior probabilities?

If we rely only on a discriminant function and the loss matrix elements are revised, we must re-train the model. However, using posterior probabilities makes it straightforward to adjust the decision boundary without re-training on the data.

## How are class-conditional densities and posterior probabilities represented in the given figure?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_3a79e15ed1a634320c5fg-1.jpg?height=702&width=1494&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=147)

%

The figure represents class-conditional densities and posterior probabilities as follows:

- **Left Plot**: Displays the class-conditional densities $p(x|\mathcal{C}_1)$ (blue) and $p(x|\mathcal{C}_2)$ (red) for classes $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ across a single input variable \( x \). The density for $\mathcal{C}_1$ has two modes, while the density for $\mathcal{C}_2$ has one mode.
- **Right Plot**: Shows the posterior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_1|x)$ (blue curve) and $p(\mathcal{C}_2|x)$ (red curve) as functions of \( x \), with the vertical green line indicating the decision boundary. This decision boundary minimizes the misclassification rate, assuming equal prior probabilities for both classes.

- #machine-learning, #probability, #decision-boundary

## What role does the decision boundary play in minimizing misclassification rate in the context of equal prior class probabilities?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_3a79e15ed1a634320c5fg-1.jpg?height=702&width=1494&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=147)

%

The decision boundary, shown as a vertical green line in the right plot, represents the value of \( x \) that minimizes the misclassification rate. It separates the input space such that:

- If \( x \) is to the left of the line, the decision favors class $\mathcal{C}_1$.
- If \( x \) is to the right of the line, the decision favors class $\mathcal{C}_2$.

This boundary is chosen based on the assumption that the prior probabilities of both classes, $p(\mathcal{C}_1)$ and $p(\mathcal{C}_2)$, are equal, ensuring the minimum probability of misclassification.

- #machine-learning, #classification, #decision-boundary

## What do the left and right plots in the figure illustrate in the context of probabilistic models for machine learning?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_3a79e15ed1a634320c5fg-1.jpg?height=702&width=1494&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=147)

%

The left plot shows the class-conditional densities $p(x|\mathcal{C}_1)$ and $p(x|\mathcal{C}_2)$ for two classes, $\mathcal{C}_1$ (blue) and $\mathcal{C}_2$ (red), with respect to a single input variable $x$. The right plot displays the corresponding posterior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_1|x)$ and $p(\mathcal{C}_2|x)$. The right plot also shows the decision boundary (green vertical line), which minimizes the misclassification rate under the assumption that the prior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_1)$ and $p(\mathcal{C}_2)$ are equal.

## How is the decision boundary determined based on the class-conditional densities and posterior probabilities?

%

The decision boundary is determined by the point $x$ where the posterior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_1|x)$ and $p(\mathcal{C}_2|x)$ are equal, which minimizes the probability of misclassification. It is shown as the green vertical line in the right plot. It assumes equal prior probabilities for the classes $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$.

### Flashcard 1

## Why is it problematic to train an adaptive model on a highly imbalanced data set in a cancer classification problem?

Training on a highly imbalanced data set can be problematic because the classifier might simply assign every point to the majority class (normal class in this case), achieving a high accuracy (e.g., 99.9%) but failing to identify cancer cases.

- #machine-learning, #data-imbalance

---

### Flashcard 2

## How can we adjust the posterior probabilities obtained from a balanced data set to reflect the actual class fractions in a population?

The posterior probabilities from a balanced data set can be adjusted by dividing by the class fractions in the balanced data set and then multiplying by the class fractions in the target population, followed by normalization.

$$
p(\mathcal{C}_k \mid \mathbf{x}) = \frac{p_{\text{balanced}}(\mathcal{C}_k \mid \mathbf{x})}{p_{\text{balanced}}(\mathcal{C}_k)} \cdot p_{\text{population}}(\mathcal{C}_k)
$$

### Flashcard 3

## Derive the posterior probability for a class $\mathcal{C}_k$ given image and blood data, assuming conditional independence.

We start with the conditional independence assumption for distributions $p(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}}, \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}} \mid \mathcal{C}_k)$:
$$
p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}}, \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) = p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right)
$$

Applying Bayes' theorem:
$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}}, \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}\right) \propto p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}}, \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)
$$

Substituting the conditional independence:
$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}}, \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}\right) \propto p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)
$$

Rewriting with marginal likelihoods:
$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}}\right) = \frac{p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)}{p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}}\right)}
$$

Thus:
$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}}, \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}\right) \propto \frac{p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}}\right) p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}\right)}{p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)}
$$

## What is the significance of normalizing posterior probabilities in a classification problem?

Normalization is crucial to ensure that the posterior probabilities sum to one, maintaining them as valid probabilities.

---

### Flashcard 5

## Explain the concept of conditional independence in the context of combining image and blood data for classification.

Conditional independence implies that given a class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$, the distributions of the image data $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}}$ and blood data $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}$ are independent:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}}, \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right)=p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{I}} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right)
$$

This allows for simplified calculations of joint probabilities, benefiting from Bayes' theorem’s application.

## Why might we prefer to build separate models for different data types (e.g., images and blood tests) rather than a single model?

$$

where $N_{\mathrm{TP}}$ is the number of true positives, $N_{\mathrm{FP}}$ is the number of false positives, $N_{\mathrm{TN}}$ is the number of true negatives, and $N_{\mathrm{FN}}$ is the number of false negatives.

## What is a confusion matrix and what performance metrics can be derived from it in the context of a cancer treatment problem?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_fc1c9f1146b37661bb76g-1.jpg?height=141&width=435&top_left_y=230&top_left_x=1050)

A confusion matrix is a table used to describe the performance of a classification algorithm. It outlines the following key components:

- **True Negatives (TN)**: Instances correctly identified as 'normal' (no cancer).
- **False Positives (FP)**: Instances incorrectly classified as 'cancer' when they are 'normal'.
- **False Negatives (FN)**: Instances incorrectly classified as 'normal' when they are 'cancer'.
- **True Positives (TP)**: Instances correctly identified as 'cancer'.

From this matrix, various performance metrics can be derived:

- **Accuracy**: $(\text{TP} + \text{TN}) / (\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN})$
- **Precision (Positive Predictive Value)**: $\text{TP} / (\text{TP} + \text{FP})$
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: $\text{TP} / (\text{TP} + \text{FN})$
- **Specificity**: $\text{TN} / (\text{TN} + \text{FP})$
- **F1 Score**: $2 \times (\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}) / (\text{Precision} + \text{Recall})$

These metrics help in understanding both the overall accuracy of the classifier and the types of errors it makes (type 1 or type 2 errors).

- **False Positives (FP)**: The number of instances incorrectly classified as positive (cancer) when they are negative (no cancer).
- **False Negatives (FN)**: The number of instances incorrectly classified as negative (no cancer) when they are positive (cancer).
- **True Positives (TP)**: The number of instances correctly classified as positive (cancer).

These values are instrumental in evaluating the performance of a classifier, specifically in terms of its ability to correctly identify and misclassify instances.

%

The confusion matrix can be utilized to compute the following key performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.
\[
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + FN + TN}
\]

- **Precision** (also called Positive Predictive Value): The proportion of positive test outcomes that are true positives.
\[
\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
\]

- **Recall** (also called Sensitivity or True Positive Rate): The proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.
\[
\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
\]

- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
\[
F1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
\]

- **ROC Curve and AUC**: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots the true positive rate (Recall) against the false positive rate (1 - Specificity) at various threshold settings, and its Area Under the Curve (AUC) gives an aggregate measure of performance across all thresholds.

## Explain why accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced class scenarios, using the cancer screening example from the paper.
  
Accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced class scenarios because it does not account for the distribution of class labels. For example, in a cancer screening setting where only 1 person in 1,000 has cancer, a classifier that predicts no one has cancer will achieve $99.9\%$ accuracy, but is completely useless as it fails to detect any actual cancer cases.

- .classification-problems, .performance-metrics

## Define the precision and recall metrics and explain their importance in the context of the cancer screening example.

Precision and recall can be defined as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Precision} &= \frac{N_{\mathrm{TP}}}{N_{\mathrm{TP}} + N_{\mathrm{FP}}} \\
\text{Recall} &= \frac{N_{\mathrm{TP}}}{N_{\mathrm{TP}} + N_{\mathrm{FN}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

In the cancer screening example, precision indicates the probability that a person who has a positive test actually has cancer, while recall indicates the probability that the test correctly identifies individuals who have cancer.

- .classification-problems, .metrics.precision-recall
  
## What does the false positive rate indicate in the context of a cancer screening test? Provide its mathematical definition.

The false positive rate indicates the probability that a person who is actually normal will be classified as having cancer. Mathematically, it is defined as:

$$
\text{False positive rate} = \frac{N_{\mathrm{FP}}}{N_{\mathrm{FP}} + N_{\mathrm{TN}}}
$$

- .classification-problems, .metrics.false-positive-rate

## {{c1::Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves}} are useful for understanding the trade-off between type 1 and type 2 errors. 

## How can you alter the trade-off between type 1 and type 2 errors for a probabilistic classifier?

To alter the trade-off between type 1 and type 2 errors for a probabilistic classifier, you can change the threshold value at which the classifier decides a positive or negative outcome. By varying this threshold, you can reduce type 1 errors (false positives) at the expense of increasing type 2 errors (false negatives), and vice versa.

- .classification-problems, .threshold-adjustment

## Define False Discovery Rate (FDR) and explain its implication in the context of a cancer screening test.

False Discovery Rate (FDR) is defined as:

$$
\text{False Discovery Rate} = \frac{N_{\mathrm{FP}}}{N_{\mathrm{FP}} + N_{\mathrm{TP}}}
$$

In the context of a cancer screening test, FDR represents the fraction of those testing positive who do not actually have cancer. It gives an estimate of the incorrect positive diagnoses.

- .classification-problems, .metrics.false-discovery-rate
  
## Explain how the regions $A, B, C, D, E$ in the decision boundary of a classifier relate to $N_{\mathrm{TP}}, N_{\mathrm{FP}}, N_{\mathrm{FN}}, N_{\mathrm{TN}}$.

The regions are related to the various true and false rates as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& N_{\mathrm{FP}} / N = E \\
& N_{\mathrm{TP}} / N = D + E \\
& N_{\mathrm{FN}} / N = B + C \\
& N_{\mathrm{TN}} / N = A + C
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $N$ represents the total number of observations, and $N_{\mathrm{TP}}, N_{\mathrm{FP}}, N_{\mathrm{FN}}, N_{\mathrm{TN}}$ represent the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives, respectively.

- .classification-problems, .decision-boundary
```

## What is the ROC curve, and what does its diagonal line represent in the context of a classifier?

The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve plots the true positive rate ($y$-axis) versus the false positive rate ($x$-axis). The diagonal line in the ROC curve represents the performance of a random classifier, which assigns each data point to the cancer class with probability $\rho$ and to the normal class with probability $1-\rho$. This baseline ROC curve is a straight line from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$.

$$
\text{Diagonal ROC curve for random classifier:} \quad y = x
$$

- #machine-learning, #statistics.roc-curve

## Explain the significance of a classifier's position on the ROC curve. Where does the best possible classifier lie?

A classifier's position on the ROC curve indicates its performance. The best possible classifier would be represented by a point at the top left corner of the ROC diagram, which corresponds to a true positive rate of 1 and a false positive rate of 0.

$$
\text{Best classifier:} \; (0, 1)
$$

- #machine-learning, #statistics.roc-curve

## What does the area under the ROC curve (AUC) represent, and what is its significance?

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) represents the overall performance of a classifier. An AUC value of 0.5 corresponds to random guessing, whereas an AUC value of 1.0 corresponds to a perfect classifier.

$$
\text{AUC} = \int_0^1 TPR(FPR) \, d(FPR)
$$

where $TPR$ is the true positive rate and $FPR$ is the false positive rate.

- #machine-learning, #statistics.auc
  
## Define the $F$-score and explain what it measures in the context of classification problems.

The $F$-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that balances both precision and recall.

$$
F_\beta = \left(1 + \beta^2\right) \cdot \frac{{\text{precision} \cdot \text{recall}}}{{\left(\beta^2 \cdot \text{precision}\right) + \text{recall}}}
$$

Typically, $\beta=1$ is used, which is called the $F_1$ score.

$$
F_1 = \frac{2 \cdot \text{precision} \cdot \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}}
$$

- #machine-learning, #statistics.f-score

## In ROC analysis, explain the significance of the top right corner and bottom left corner for classifiers.

The top right corner of the ROC curve represents a classifier that assigns every data point to the cancer class, resulting in all true positives and false positives. Conversely, the bottom left corner represents a classifier that assigns every data point to the normal class, resulting in no false or true positives.

- #machine-learning, #statistics.roc-corner

## What happens to the ROC curve when two classifier curves cross each other, and how should we interpret it?

When two ROC curves cross each other, the choice of the better classifier depends on the operating point. This implies that at different thresholds, one classifier may perform better than the other. The best classifier should be chosen based on the specific false positive rate or true positive rate important for the application.

Describe the significance of the decision boundary \( x_0 \) in the given classification task.

%

The decision boundary \( x_0 \) separates the classification regions \( \mathcal{R}_1 \) assigned to class C1 (normal) and \( \mathcal{R}_2 \) assigned to class C2 (cancer). The placement of \( x_0 \) determines which values of the measurement x will be classified as C1 or C2, thus influencing the trade-off between false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN). Adjusting \( x_0 \) changes the sizes and shapes of the regions, affecting the classification outcomes and the performance measures like sensitivity and specificity.

## Define linear classification models and the concept of linearly separable data sets.

Linear classification models are models where the decision surfaces are linear functions of the input vector $\mathbf{x}$ and, hence, are defined by $(D-1)$-dimensional hyperplanes within the $D$-dimensional input space. Data sets whose classes can be separated exactly by linear decision surfaces are said to be linearly separable.

- #classification, #linear-models

## Explain the three distinct approaches to solving classification problems as mentioned in the paper.

The three distinct approaches to solving classification problems are:
1. Constructing a discriminant function that directly assigns each vector $\mathbf{x}$ to a specific class.
2. Modeling the conditional probability distributions $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x})$ in an inference stage and subsequently using these distributions to make optimal decisions. This can be further divided into:
   - Discriminative probabilistic models
   - Generative probabilistic models

- #classification, #modeling-approaches

## Given Bayes' theorem for generative probabilistic models, derive how the posterior probabilities are computed.

In generative probabilistic models, we model the class-conditional densities $p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k})$ and the prior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_{k})$ for the classes, then compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

$$
p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}) = \frac{p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}) p(\mathcal{C}_{k})}{p(\mathbf{x})}
$$

Here $p(\mathbf{x})$ is the evidence, which can be computed as:

$$
p(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{j} p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{j}) p(\mathcal{C}_{j})
$$

## What is a discriminant function in the context of classification problems, and how is it related to the input vector $\mathbf{x}$?

A discriminant function is a function that takes an input vector $\mathbf{x}$ and assigns it to one of $K$ classes, denoted $\mathcal{C}_{k}$. In linear discriminants, the decision surfaces are hyperplanes.

- #classification, #discriminant-functions, #linear-discriminants

## Derive the simplest representation of a linear discriminant function for two classes, and explain the decision boundary.

The simplest representation of a linear discriminant function for two classes is:

$$
y(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + w_{0}
$$

where $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector and $w_{0}$ is a bias. An input vector $\mathbf{x}$ is assigned to class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ if $y(\mathbf{x}) \geq 0$ and to class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ otherwise. The decision boundary is defined by $y(\mathbf{x}) = 0$, which corresponds to a $(D-1)$-dimensional hyperplane.

- #classification, #discriminant-functions, #linear-discriminants

## Explain the significance of the terms $\mathbf{w}$ and $w_{0}$ in the linear discriminant function for two classes.

In the linear discriminant function 

$$y(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + w_{0},$$ 

$\mathbf{w}$ represents the weight vector, which determines the orientation of the decision boundary, and $w_{0}$ is the bias term, which shifts the decision boundary. It's important to note that $w_{0}$ is not the statistical bias.

## What does the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve represent, and how is it used to evaluate classifiers?

The ROC curve is a plot of true positive rate (TPR) against false positive rate (FPR) that characterizes the trade-off between type 1 errors (false positives) and type 2 errors (false negatives) in a classification problem. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is often used to evaluate the overall performance of classifiers. A classifier with a higher ROC curve is generally better.

- #machine-learning, #classification.roc-curve

## Derive the $F_1$ score from precision and recall. 

The $F_1$ score is a measure of a test's accuracy and is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_1 &= \frac{2 \times \text{precision} \times \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}} \\
    &= \frac{2N_{\text{TP}}}{2N_{\text{TP}} + N_{\text{FP}} + N_{\text{FN}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $N_{\text{TP}}$ is the number of true positives, $N_{\text{FP}}$ is the number of false positives, and $N_{\text{FN}}$ is the number of false negatives.

- #metrics, #classification.f1-score
  
## How can the confusion matrix and loss matrix be used together to compute expected loss?

To compute the expected loss, multiply the elements of the confusion matrix and the loss matrix pointwise, and then sum the resulting products. This method allows for calculating the cost associated with classification errors by considering both the type and frequency of errors.

- #metrics, #classification.confusion-matrix, #loss

## Explain the difference between discriminative and generative approaches to classification.

Discriminative approaches to classification directly model the decision boundary between classes by learning $p(\mathcal{C}_k \mid \mathbf{x})$ directly. Generative approaches, on the other hand, model the class-conditional densities $p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_k)$ and class priors $p(\mathcal{C}_k)$, and use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_k \mid \mathbf{x})$.

$$
p(\mathcal{C}_k \mid \mathbf{x}) = \frac{p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_k)p(\mathcal{C}_k)}{\sum_{i} p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_i)p(\mathcal{C}_i)}
$$

- #machine-learning, #classification.generative, #classification.discriminative

## What assumption leads to linear decision boundaries in generative classifiers?

Linear decision boundaries arise from the assumption that the class-conditional densities $p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_k)$ are Gaussian with shared covariance matrices. This leads to the log-likelihood ratio being a linear function of $\mathbf{x}$, resulting in linear decision boundaries.

- #machine-learning, #classification.generative
  
## With regard to the ROC curve and its extension to more than two classes, explain why it becomes cumbersome.

The ROC curve can be extended to multi-class problems, but it becomes cumbersome because the number of pairwise comparisons between classes grows quadratically with the number of classes. This makes it difficult to visualize and interpret the performance of classifiers as the number of classes increases.

## What does the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve illustrate in a classification problem?

%
The ROC curve is a plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier as its discrimination threshold is varied. It represents the trade-off between the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The better the classifier, the larger the area under the ROC curve.

## How do the blue and red curves on the ROC plot compare in terms of classifier performance?

%
The blue curve represents a superior classifier with a higher true positive rate (TPR) for the same false positive rate (FPR) compared to the red curve. The red curve indicates a classifier with performance between random guessing (dashed line) and the better blue curve. The area under the blue curve is greater, indicating better overall performance.

## What does the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve illustrate about classifier performance?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_1cbadc682ee2a0381817g-1.jpg?height=704&width=711&top_left_y=212&top_left_x=934)

%

The ROC curve illustrates the trade-off between the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) for different threshold settings of a binary classifier. It helps to evaluate and compare the performance of classifiers by plotting:

- The TPR on the y-axis.
- The FPR on the x-axis.

Key points:
1. The upper blue curve indicates a superior classifier with higher TPR for the same FPR compared to the lower red curve.
2. The red curve represents a classifier with intermediate performance.
3. The dashed line (slope of 1) represents a random classifier's performance.

Overall, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) quantifies a classifier’s performance, where a higher AUC represents a better classifier.

- #machine-learning, #classification.performance, #roc-curve

## Why is the blue curve considered a better classifier than the red curve in the ROC graph?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_1cbadc682ee2a0381817g-1.jpg?height=704&width=711&top_left_y=212&top_left_x=934)

%

The blue curve in the ROC graph is considered a better classifier than the red curve because it:

1. Maintains a consistently higher true positive rate (TPR) for any given false positive rate (FPR).
2. Results in a greater Area Under the Curve (AUC), indicating better overall performance.

The blue curve shows that the classifier is more accurate at distinguishing between the positive and negative classes across different thresholds.

## Explain the logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$.

The logistic sigmoid function is defined as:

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)}
$$

This function maps the entire real axis to a finite interval between 0 and 1. It is often used in classification algorithms and satisfies the symmetry property $\sigma(-a) = 1 - \sigma(a)$.

- #machine-learning.classification, #mathematics.functions

## What symmetry property does the logistic sigmoid function satisfy?

The logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ satisfies the symmetry property:

$$
\sigma(-a) = 1 - \sigma(a)
$$

This property is easily verified by substituting $-a$ for $a$ in the logistic sigmoid function:

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)}
$$

and

$$
\sigma(-a) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(a)} = 1 - \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)} = 1 - \sigma(a)
$$

- #machine-learning.classification, #mathematics.functions

## Derive the inverse of the logistic sigmoid function.

The inverse of the logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ can be derived as follows. Starting from the definition:

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)}
$$

We set $\sigma$ equal to $\frac{1}{1+\exp(-a)}$ and solve for $a$:

$$
\sigma = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)} \implies 1 + \exp(-a) = \frac{1}{\sigma}
$$

$$
\exp(-a) = \frac{1}{\sigma} - 1 = \frac{1 - \sigma}{\sigma}
$$

Taking the log of both sides:

$$
-a = \ln\left(\frac{1 - \sigma}{\sigma}\right) \implies a = \ln\left(\frac{\sigma}{1 - \sigma}\right)
$$

- #machine-learning.classification, #mathematics.inverses

## How can $p(\mathcal{C}_1 | \mathbf{x})$ be expressed using $\sigma(a)$?

The posterior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_1 | \mathbf{x})$ can be expressed using the logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ as follows:

$$
p(\mathcal{C}_1 | \mathbf{x}) = \frac{p(\mathbf{x} | \mathcal{C}_1) p(\mathcal{C}_1)}{p(\mathbf{x} | \mathcal{C}_1) p(\mathcal{C}_1) + p(\mathbf{x} | \mathcal{C}_2) p(\mathcal{C}_2)} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)} = \sigma(a)
$$

where $a$ is defined as:

$$
a = \ln \frac{p(\mathbf{x} | \mathcal{C}_1) p(\mathcal{C}_1)}{p(\mathbf{x} | \mathcal{C}_2) p(\mathcal{C}_2)}
$$

## What is the scaled probit function and why is it used alongside the logistic sigmoid function?

The scaled probit function $\Phi(\lambda a)$ is defined such that its derivatives are equal to those of the logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ at $a = 0$. For $\lambda^2 = \pi/8$, the scaling factor $\pi/8$ is chosen to match these derivatives. This creates a useful comparison between the probit and logistic sigmoid functions for classification purposes.

- #machine-learning.classification, #statistics.probit

## What is the significance of the logit function in relation to the logistic sigmoid?

The logit function is the inverse of the logistic sigmoid function and is defined as:

$$
a = \ln\left(\frac{\sigma}{1 - \sigma}\right)
$$

It represents the log of the ratio of probabilities, also known as the log odds, for two classes:

$$
\ln \left[ p(\mathcal{C}_1 | \mathbf{x}) / p(\mathcal{C}_2 | \mathbf{x}) \right]
$$

This logit function is crucial for understanding the relationship between the logistic sigmoid and posterior probabilities.

## What are the logistic sigmoid function and the scaled probit function, and how are they related in the given plot?

%

The logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ is defined as:

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)}
$$

The scaled probit function $\Phi(\lambda a)$, with the scaling factor $\lambda^2 = \pi / 8$, is chosen so that the derivatives of both curves are equal for $a = 0$. 

The plot shows:
- The logistic sigmoid function (red solid curve)
- The scaled probit function (blue dashed curve)

The scaling factor ensures that the two curves have the same derivative at $a = 0$.

## How is the probability \( p(\mathcal{C}_1 \mid \mathbf{x}) \) related to the logistic sigmoid function?

%

The probability \( p(\mathcal{C}_1 \mid \mathbf{x}) \) can be written as:

$$
p(\mathcal{C}_1 \mid \mathbf{x}) = \frac{p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_1) p(\mathcal{C}_1)}{p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_1) p(\mathcal{C}_1) + p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_2) p(\mathcal{C}_2)}
$$

This expression simplifies to:

$$
p(\mathcal{C}_1 \mid \mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)} = \sigma(a)
$$

where 

$$
a = \ln \left(\frac{p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_1) p(\mathcal{C}_1)}{p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_2) p(\mathcal{C}_2)}\right)
$$

and $\sigma(a)$ is the logistic sigmoid function.

The logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ is defined as:

In Figure 5.12, the logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$, shown as the solid red curve, and the scaled probit function $\Phi(\lambda a)$, shown as the dashed blue curve, are compared. The scaling factor $\lambda^2 = \frac{\pi}{8}$ ensures that the derivatives of both functions are equal at $a = 0$. Both functions map real-valued inputs into a range between 0 and 1, useful for representing probabilities in classification tasks, with $\sigma(a)$ defined by:

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)}

The quadratic terms in $\mathbf{x}$ from the exponents of the Gaussian densities cancel due to the assumption of common covariance matrices $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$. This cancellation results in a linear function of $\mathbf{x}$ in the argument of the logistic sigmoid function:

Where:

- $\mathbf{w}_{k}$ is a weight vector for class $k$

The decision boundaries are linear in the input space because $a_{k}(\mathbf{x})$ depends linearly on $\mathbf{x}$:

$$
a_{k}(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{w}_{k}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}+w_{k 0}
$$

Additionally, the posterior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x})$ result in linear decision functions due to the shared covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$. The bias term $w_{k 0}$ incorporates prior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_{k})$ causing parallel shifts but not altering the linearity.

Cancellations no longer occur when each class-conditional density $p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k})$ has its own covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{k}$ instead of a shared covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$. In this case, quadratic terms do not cancel out, yielding quadratic functions of $\mathbf{x}$ and resulting in quadratic discriminant boundaries.

And

$$

We have:

$$
\mathbf{w}_{k} = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}
$$

This relation is derived from the quadratic expression in the multivariate normal density when using a shared covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$. The inverse covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}$ weights the mean vector $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}$ to produce the weight vector $\mathbf{w}_{k}$ for class $k$.

## Explain the expression that denotes the joint probability for class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ given a data point $\mathbf{x}_{n}$ and its parameters.

For class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ when $t_{n} = 1$, the joint probability $p(\mathbf{x}_{n}, \mathcal{C}_{1})$ is given by:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}, \mathcal{C}_{1}\right) = p\left(\mathcal{C}_{1}\right) p\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \mathcal{C}_{1}\right)
$$

Given that $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{1}\right) = \pi$ and $\mathbf{x}_{n}$ follows a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)$, we have:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}, \mathcal{C}_{1}\right) = \pi \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)
$$

## Describe the likelihood function for a data set with Gaussian class-conditional densities and shared covariance matrix.

The likelihood function for a data set $\left\{\mathbf{x}_{n}, t_{n}\right\}$ with Gaussian class-conditional densities and shared covariance matrix is:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{X} \mid \pi, \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right) = \prod_{n=1}^{N}\left[\pi \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)\right]^{t_{n}}\left[(1-\pi) \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)\right]^{1-t_{n}}
$$

where $\mathbf{t} = \left(t_{1}, \ldots, t_{N}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}$.

Here, $t_{n}$ indicates the class label of the data point $\mathbf{x}_{n}$.

- #likelihood, #probability, #gaussian-distribution

---

## In the context of maximizing the likelihood function, what is the implication of taking the logarithm of the likelihood function?

Taking the logarithm of the likelihood function simplifies the product of probabilities into a sum of logarithms, which is more convenient for maximization. The likelihood function in this context is:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{X} \mid \pi, \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right) = \prod_{n=1}^{N}\left[\pi \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)\right]^{t_{n}}\left[(1-\pi) \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)\right]^{1-t_{n}}
$$

Maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood but often simplifies the computation.

## How is the boundary between classes $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ with the same covariance matrix described?

The boundary between classes $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ having the same covariance matrix is linear. This is due to the fact that the discriminant function for Gaussian distributions with shared covariance reduces to a linear function.

- #decision-boundaries, #classification, #gaussian-distribution

## Given two classes with different covariance matrices, what shape do the decision boundaries typically take?

For two classes with different covariance matrices, the decision boundaries are typically quadratic. This non-linear nature arises from the different shapes and spreads of the Gaussian distributions.

## Define the prior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_{1})$ and $p(\mathcal{C}_{2})$ in the context of Gaussian class-conditional densities.

The prior probabilities for classes $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ are defined as:

$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{1}\right) = \pi \quad \text{and} \quad p\left(\mathcal{C}_{2}\right) = 1 - \pi
$$

These priors indicate the initial belief about the proportion of each class before observing any data.

Figure 5.14 depicts the class-conditional densities and posterior probabilities for three classes, each following a Gaussian distribution (red, green, and blue). The key points are:

- **Left Plot**: Shows the class-conditional densities with contours representing areas of equal probability density.
  - **Red and Blue Classes**: Identical covariance matrices resulting in linear decision boundary.
  - **Green Class**: Different covariance matrix, leading to quadratic decision boundaries against red and blue classes.
  
- **Right Plot**: Displays posterior probabilities, where each point is colored based on the proportion of posterior probabilities for the three classes. The decision boundaries are explicit, demonstrating linearity between red and blue, and quadratic boundaries for the other class pairs.

%

In Figure 5.14, the shape of the decision boundaries between different classes is determined by the covariance matrices of the Gaussian distributions:

- **Red and Blue Classes**: Shared covariance matrix, resulting in a linear decision boundary.
- **Other Class Pairs (Red-Green, Blue-Green)**: Different covariance matrices, leading to quadratic decision boundaries.

The right-hand plot uses proportional coloring (red, blue, and green ink) to represent the posterior probabilities of the respective three classes. Each point on the image is colored based on the posterior probabilities of the red, blue, and green classes. The decision boundaries between classes are also shown, with the boundary between the red and blue classes being linear due to shared covariance matrices, and the boundaries between the red and green classes, as well as the blue and green classes, being quadratic because of different covariance matrices.

%

The decision boundary between the red and blue classes is linear because they share the same covariance matrix, leading to linear decision boundaries. In contrast, the boundaries between the red and green classes, as well as the blue and green classes, are quadratic due to the different covariance matrices of these classes.

%

The left-hand plot shows the class-conditional densities for three classes, each having a Gaussian distribution and colored red, green, and blue. The red and blue classes share the same covariance matrix, resulting in a linear decision boundary between these two classes. The green class has a different covariance matrix, which results in quadratic decision boundaries between the green class and the other two classes.

The decision boundaries in the right-hand plot delineate the regions for the respective classes based on posterior probabilities.

## Explain the maximization with respect to $\pi$ in the log likelihood function.

The log likelihood function for $\pi$ is given by:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{t_{n} \ln \pi+\left(1-t_{n}\right) \ln (1-\pi)\right\}
$$

To find the maximum likelihood estimate for $\pi$, we set the derivative with respect to $\pi$ to zero and rearrange:

$$
\pi=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} t_{n}=\frac{N_{1}}{N}=\frac{N_{1}}{N_{1}+N_{2}}
$$

where $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ are the counts of data points in classes $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{2}$, respectively. Thus, $\pi$ is the fraction of points in class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$. This can be generalized for multiple classes.

- #probability #statistical-methods.maximum-likelihood-estimate

## What is the generalized form of $\pi$ for multi-class cases in maximum likelihood estimation?

In the multi-class case, the maximum likelihood estimate of the prior probability $\pi_k$ associated with class $\mathcal{C}_k$ is given by the fraction of the training set points assigned to that class. Mathematically,

$$
\pi_k = \frac{N_k}{N}
$$

where $N_k$ is the number of data points in class $\mathcal{C}_k$ and $N$ is the total number of data points.

- #probability #statistical-methods.multi-class

## Derive and explain the maximization with respect to $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}$ in the log likelihood function.

The relevant part of the log likelihood function for $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}$ is:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{N} t_{n} \ln \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right) = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} t_{n}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}-\boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}\right)^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}-\boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}\right) + \text{const.}
$$

Setting the derivative with respect to $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}$ to zero and rearranging, we get:

$$
\boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}=\frac{1}{N_{1}} \sum_{n=1}^{N} t_{n} \mathbf{x}_{n}
$$

This result is the mean of input vectors $\mathbf{x}_{n}$ assigned to class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$.

- #probability #statistical-methods.maximization.mean

## Confirm and explain the corresponding maximization for $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}$.

By similar derivations as for $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}$, the result for $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}$ is:

$$
\boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}=\frac{1}{N_{2}} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(1-t_{n}\right) \mathbf{x}_{n}
$$

This result is the mean of input vectors $\mathbf{x}_{n}$ assigned to class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$.

- #probability #statistical-methods.maximization.mean

## What are the steps to find the maximum likelihood estimate for the shared covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$?

To find the maximum likelihood estimation of $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$, consider the relevant log likelihood parts:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} t_{n} \ln |\boldsymbol{\Sigma}|-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} t_{n}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}-\boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}\right)^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}-\boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}\right) \\
& -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(1-t_{n}\right) \ln |\boldsymbol{\Sigma}|-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(1-t_{n}\right)\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}-\boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}\right)^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}-\boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}\right) \\
& =-\frac{N}{2} \ln |\boldsymbol{\Sigma}|-\frac{N}{2} \operatorname{Tr}\left\{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} \mathbf{S}\right\}
\end{aligned}
$$

Set the derivative with respect to $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ equal to zero and solve for $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$:

$$
\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \frac{\mathbf{S}}{N}
$$

where $\mathbf{S}$ is the scatter matrix.

- #probability #statistical-methods.maximization.covariance

## What is the interpretation of $\mathbf{S}$ in the context of finding $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$?

The scatter matrix $\mathbf{S}$ summarizes the variance-covariance relationships in the data and is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{S} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} t_{n} (\mathbf{x}_{n} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1})(\mathbf{x}_{n} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1})^{\mathrm{T}} + \sum_{n=1}^{N} (1-t_{n}) (\mathbf{x}_{n} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{2})(\mathbf{x}_{n} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{2})^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

Thus, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ captures this overall variability, scaled by $N$.

## Define the variable $\mathbf{S}$ using the given context.

We define $\mathbf{S}$ as a weighted average of the covariance matrices $\mathbf{S}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{S}_{2}$:

$$
\mathbf{S} = \frac{N_{1}}{N} \mathbf{S}_{1} + \frac{N_{2}}{N} \mathbf{S}_{2}
$$

where $N$ is the total number of samples, $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ are the number of samples in Class 1 and Class 2, respectively.

## What is $\mathbf{S}_{1}$ and how is it computed?

$\mathbf{S}_{1}$ is the covariance matrix associated with Class 1, calculated as:

$$
\mathbf{S}_{1} = \frac{1}{N_{1}} \sum_{n \in \mathcal{C}_{1}}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}\right)\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}

where $N_{1}$ is the number of samples in Class 1, $\mathbf{x}_{n}$ are the data points, and $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}$ is the mean vector for Class 1.

## What assumption is made in the naive Bayes model for discrete feature values?

In the naive Bayes model for discrete feature values, we assume that the feature values $x_{i}$ are independent and conditioned on the class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$. This leads to the class-conditional distribution:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) = \prod_{i=1}^{D} \mu_{k i}^{x_{i}}\left(1-\mu_{k i}\right)^{1-x_{i}}
$$

where $D$ is the number of features.

## Extend the weighted average of covariance matrices $\mathbf{S}$ to the general $K$-class problem for maximum likelihood estimation.

In the $K$-class problem, the weighted average of the covariance matrices is similarly computed by extending the definition of $\mathbf{S}$:

$$
\mathbf{S} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{N_{k}}{N} \mathbf{S}_{k}
$$

where $N_{k}$ is the number of samples in Class $k$, and $\mathbf{S}_{k}$ is the covariance matrix for Class $k$. This yields a shared covariance matrix for Gaussian distributions across multiple classes.

## Derive the linear function $a_{k}(\mathbf{x})$ in the context of the naive Bayes assumption for discrete feature values.

Starting with the class-conditional distribution:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) = \prod_{i=1}^{D} \mu_{k i}^{x_{i}}\left(1-\mu_{k i}\right)^{1-x_{i}}
$$

Substituting into equation (5.46) yields:

$$
a_{k}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{D}\left\{x_{i} \ln \mu_{k i} + \left(1-x_{i}\right) \ln \left(1 - \mu_{k i}\right)\right\} + \ln p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)
$$

This formulation shows that $a_{k}(\mathbf{x})$ are linear functions of the input values $x_{i}$.

## For binary discrete feature values $x_{i} \in \{0,1\}$, explain why the general distribution grows exponentially with the number of features.

For $D$ binary inputs, a general distribution requires a table of $2^{D}$ values for each class, leading to $2^{D} - 1$ independent variables because of the summation constraint. This exponential growth with the number of features necessitates a more restricted representation, such as the naive Bayes assumption.

## Explain the form of the class-conditional density function $p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}, s\right)$ given in the context of the exponential family of distributions.

The class-conditional density function is given by:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}, s\right) = \frac{1}{s} h\left(\frac{1}{s} \mathbf{x}\right) g\left(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}\right) \exp \left\{\frac{1}{s} \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}\right\}
$$

where:
- $s$ is a scaling parameter shared across all classes.
- $h\left(\frac{1}{s} \mathbf{x}\right)$ is a function that modulates the input $\mathbf{x}$ scaled by $\frac{1}{s}$.
- $g\left(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}\right)$ is a function of the parameter vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}$.
- $\exp \left\{\frac{1}{s} \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}\right\}$ is an exponential term involving the dot product of $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}$ and $\mathbf{x}$ scaled by $\frac{1}{s}$.

## For a two-class classification problem, derive the linear function $a(\mathbf{x})$ used in the logistic sigmoid transformation.

where:
- $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{1}$ and $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{2}$ are the parameters for classes $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{2}$, respectively.
- $g(\cdot)$ is a function related to the class-conditional densities.
- $p(\mathcal{C}_{i})$ are the class priors for each class $\mathcal{C}_{i}$.

## How does the form of the posterior probability for the multi-class problem differ from the two-class case?

For the $K$-class problem, the posterior probability is given by a softmax transformation of linear functions of $\mathbf{x}$, as opposed to a logistic sigmoid in the two-class case.

The linear function $a_{k}(\mathbf{x})$ for the $K$-class problem is:

$$
a_{k}(\mathbf{x}) = \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + \ln g\left(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}\right) + \ln p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)
$$

where:
- $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}$ are the parameters for each class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$,
- $g(\cdot)$ is a function related to the class-conditional densities,
- $p(\mathcal{C}_{k})$ are the class priors for each class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$.

## Define discriminative probabilistic modelling and compare it with generative modelling.

Discriminative probabilistic modelling focuses on directly modeling the conditional distribution $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$. It involves determining model parameters by maximizing the likelihood of this conditional distribution.

In contrast, generative modelling involves modeling the joint distribution $p\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{C}_{k}\right)$ or the class-conditional densities $p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right)$ and using Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probabilities.

**Advantages of the discriminative approach:**
1. Fewer learnable parameters.
2. Potential for improved predictive performance, especially when the assumed class-conditional densities are not accurate representations of the true distributions.

## Explain the role of the scaling parameter $s$ in the class-conditional density function.

In the exponential family representation of the class-conditional density:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}, s\right) = \frac{1}{s} h\left(\frac{1}{s} \mathbf{x}\right) g\left(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}\right) \exp \left\{\frac{1}{s} \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}\right\}
$$

the scaling parameter $s$:
- Is shared across all classes.
- Scales the input $\mathbf{x}$.
- Factors into the normalization term $\frac{1}{s}$ and the function $h\left(\frac{1}{s} \mathbf{x}\right)$.
- Scales the exponential term $\exp \left\{\frac{1}{s} \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}\right\}$, controlling the influence of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}$ on the density.

## What is the significance of using a logistic sigmoid or a softmax function in discriminative classifiers?

The logistic sigmoid and softmax functions are used to model posterior class probabilities:

- In a two-class problem, the posterior class probability is modeled as a logistic sigmoid function of a linear combination of $\mathbf{x}$: 

$$
\sigma(a(\mathbf{x})) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a(\mathbf{x}))}
$$

where $a(\mathbf{x})$ is a linear function of $\mathbf{x}$.

- In a $K$-class problem, the posterior class probabilities are modeled as a softmax function of linear combinations of $\mathbf{x}$:

$$
p(\mathcal{C}_k \mid \mathbf{x}) = \frac{\exp(a_k(\mathbf{x}))}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(a_j(\mathbf{x}))}
$$

where $a_k(\mathbf{x})$ are linear functions of $\mathbf{x}$.

These functions ensure that the output probabilities range between 0 and 1 and sum to 1, making them appropriate for classification tasks.

## What is the prediction function for linear regression?

The model prediction $y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w})$ for linear regression is given by:

$$
y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + w_0
$$

where $\mathbf{w}$ is the vector of weights, $\mathbf{x}$ is the input vector, and $w_0$ is the bias term. This predicts a continuous value in the range $(-\infty, \infty)$.

- #machine-learning, #linear-regression

## How is the model prediction modified for classification problems?

For classification problems, the linear model is modified by applying a nonlinear activation function $f(\cdot)$ to the linear combination of weights:

$$
y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) = f\left(\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + w_0\right)
$$

This transformation allows the model to output posterior probabilities that lie within $(0,1)$.

- #machine-learning, #classification, #activation-functions

## What is an activation function in machine learning?

In machine learning, an activation function $f(\cdot)$ is used to transform a linear combination of weights and input features:

$$
y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) = f\left(\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + w_0\right)
$$

The purpose of the activation function is to introduce nonlinearity, enabling the model to handle complex tasks like classification.

- #machine-learning, #activation-functions

## How can basis functions transform the input space in classification models?

In classification models, the original input vector $\mathbf{x}$ can be transformed using a vector of basis functions $\phi(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to:

$$
\mathbf{\phi}(\mathbf{x}) = \left[\phi_1(\mathbf{x}), \phi_2(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, \phi_m(\mathbf{x}) \right]^T
$$

The decision boundaries will then be linear in the feature space $\mathbf{\phi}$, corresponding to nonlinear decision boundaries in the original input space $\mathbf{x}$.

## What is the role of the basis function $\phi_0(\mathbf{x})$ in classification models?

In classification models, one of the basis functions $\phi_0(\mathbf{x})$ is typically set to a constant (e.g., 1) so that it acts as a bias term. The corresponding parameter $w_0$ plays the role of bias in the transformed input space:

$$
\phi_0(\mathbf{x}) = 1
$$

## How do nonlinear transformations affect class overlap?

Nonlinear transformations $ \phi(\mathbf{x}) $ can alter class overlap by either increasing it or creating new overlaps. Although they cannot eliminate class overlap completely, suitable choices of nonlinearity can simplify the problem of modelling posterior probabilities. These class overlaps correspond to regions where posterior probabilities are not strictly 0 or 1.

## Describe the role of nonlinear basis functions in linear classification models as illustrated in Figure 5.15.

The role of nonlinear basis functions in linear classification models is to transform the original input space $(x_1, x_2)$ into a feature space $(\phi_1, \phi_2)$ where a linear decision boundary can be applied. For instance:

- Left-hand plot: The original input space $(x_1, x_2)$ with red and blue data points and two 'Gaussian' basis functions $\phi_1(\mathbf{x})$ and $\phi_2(\mathbf{x})$ with green centres and contours.
- Right-hand plot: The feature space $(\phi_1, \phi_2)$ with a linear decision boundary obtained by a logistic regression model.

This approach results in a nonlinear decision boundary in the original input space.

- #machine-learning, #nonlinear-basis-functions, #classification-models

## What is the posterior probability of class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ in logistic regression?

The posterior probability of class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ in logistic regression can be expressed as:

$$
p(\mathcal{C}_1 | \boldsymbol{\phi}) = y(\boldsymbol{\phi}) = \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi})
$$

where $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the logistic sigmoid function, $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector, and $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ is the feature vector.

- #statistics, #logistic-regression, #posterior-probability

## Define the logistic sigmoid function used in logistic regression.

The logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(z)$, often used in logistic regression, is defined by:

$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$

This function maps real-valued numbers into the interval (0, 1), making it suitable for binary classification tasks.

- #statistics, #logistic-regression, #sigmoid-function

## Compare the number of parameters in a logistic regression model to a model fitting Gaussian class-conditional densities.

For an $M$-dimensional feature space $\phi$:

- **Logistic Regression**: Requires $M$ adjustable parameters.
- **Gaussian Class-Conditional Densities**:
  - $2M$ parameters for means.
  - $M(M+1)/2$ parameters for covariance matrix.
  - Together with the class prior $p(\mathcal{C}_1)$, a total of $M(M+5)/2 + 1$ parameters.
  
Logistic regression has a linear dependence on $M$, while Gaussian models grow quadratically with $M$. Thus, logistic regression is more scalable for large $M$.

- #statistics, #logistic-regression, #gaussian-densities

## What simplifies the number of parameters needed in logistic regression compared to Gaussian class-conditional densities?

The logistic regression model reduces the number of parameters by focusing on the linear dependence of the feature vector $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ via the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$. Instead of individually parameterizing class-conditional densities, logistic regression necessitates just $M$ adjustable parameters for an $M$-dimensional feature space $\phi$.

- #statistics, #logistic-regression, #parameter-efficiency

## Why is logistic regression advantageous for a high-dimensional feature space?

Logistic regression is advantageous for a high-dimensional feature space because it scales linearly with the number of dimensions $M$, requiring only $M$ parameters. In contrast, fitting Gaussian class-conditional densities would require $M(M+5)/2 + 1$ parameters, growing quadratically with $M$ and becoming computationally infeasible for large $M$.

Nonlinear basis functions transform the original input space $\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)$ into a feature space $\left(\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}\right)$. In this transformed space, data points from different classes become more separable, allowing for a linear decision boundary, which in logistic regression, leads to a nonlinear decision boundary in the original input space.

## Explain the transformation depicted in Figure 5.15 involving Gaussian basis functions and logistic regression.

%

The transformation involves applying Gaussian basis functions $\phi_{1}(\mathbf{x})$ and $\phi_{2}(\mathbf{x})$, centered at the green crosses in the input space $\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)$. This results in a feature space $\left(\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}\right)$, where logistic regression creates a linear decision boundary, translating into a nonlinear decision boundary in the original input space, as visualized by the separating black curve.

## What is demonstrated by the left-hand and right-hand plots in Figure 5.15 regarding nonlinear basis functions?

The left-hand plot shows the original input space $(x_1, x_2)$ with data points from two classes (red and blue). Two 'Gaussian' basis functions $\phi_1(\mathbf{x})$ and $\phi_2(\mathbf{x})$ have centers indicated by green crosses and contours represented by green circles. The right-hand plot displays the corresponding feature space $(\phi_1, \phi_2)$ and the linear decision boundary (black line) obtained using a logistic regression model. This demonstrates how applying nonlinear basis functions can transform a non-linearly separable dataset in the original input space into a linearly separable one in the feature space.

%

Nonlinear basis functions, such as the 'Gaussian' basis functions shown in the left-hand plot of Figure 5.15, help by transforming the original input space $(x_1, x_2)$ into a feature space $(\phi_1, \phi_2)$. This transformation leads to a scenario where data points become linearly separable, as shown in the feature space plot on the right-hand side. Consequently, a linear decision boundary in the feature space corresponds to a nonlinear decision boundary in the original input space, allowing a logistic regression model to classify the data effectively.

## What controls the orientation of the decision surface in a linear discriminant function?

The orientation of the decision surface is controlled by the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$, which is orthogonal to the decision surface. This is derived from the condition that for any points $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}$ lying on the decision surface:

$$
\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}}(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{A}} - \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}) = 0
$$

This implies that $\mathbf{w}$ is orthogonal to any vector lying within the decision surface.

---

## What role does the bias parameter $w_0$ play in a linear discriminant function?

The bias parameter $w_0$ determines the displacement of the decision surface from the origin. The normal distance from the origin to the decision surface is given by:

$$
\frac{\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|} = -\frac{w_0}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}
$$

- .geometry, .bias-parameter

---

## How do you calculate the perpendicular distance $r$ of a point $\mathbf{x}$ from the decision surface in a linear discriminant function?

The perpendicular distance $r$ of a point $\mathbf{x}$ from the decision surface is given by:

$$
r = \frac{y(\mathbf{x})}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}
$$

where $y(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + w_0$ is the signed measure of the distance.

- .geometry, .distance-calculation

---

## What is the equation for $y(\mathbf{x})$ in terms of compact notation with dummy input?

In compact notation, introducing an additional dummy input $x_0 = 1$, the equation for $y(\mathbf{x})$ is:

$$
y(\mathbf{x}) = \widetilde{\mathbf{w}}^{\mathrm{T}} \widetilde{\mathbf{x}}
$$

where $\widetilde{\mathbf{w}} = (w_0, \mathbf{w})$ and $\widetilde{\mathbf{x}} = (x_0, \mathbf{x})$.

- .geometry, .compact-notation

---

## What condition must be satisfied for points lying on the decision surface in a linear discriminant function?

For points lying on the decision surface, the condition is:

$$
y(\mathbf{x}) = 0
$$

which translates to:

$$
\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + w_0 = 0
$$

- .geometry, #decision-surface

## Explain the process of finding the normal distance from the origin to the decision surface in a linear discriminant function.

To find the normal distance from the origin to the decision surface, consider a point $\mathbf{x}$ on the decision surface where $y(\mathbf{x}) = 0$. The normal distance $d$ is given by:

$$
d = \frac{\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}
$$

For points on the decision surface, $\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}$ is equal to $-w_0$. Thus, the distance is:

$$
d = -\frac{w_0}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}
$$

The image is a two-dimensional representation of a linear discriminant function. It showcases:
- Two input feature axes, $x_1$ and $x_2$.

- The boundary is perpendicular to the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$, indicated by a green arrow.
- The displacements from a point $\mathbf{x}$ to the boundary and the orthogonal projection are highlighted. The distance is given by $\frac{y(\mathbf{x})}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}$.
- The bias term $\frac{-w_{0}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}$ is shown on the $x_1$ axis, indicating the decision boundary's position relative to the origin.

## Explain how the bias term \( w_0 \) influences the decision boundary in a linear discriminant function.

%

The bias parameter \( w_0 \) controls the displacement of the decision boundary from the origin. The normal distance from the origin to the decision surface is given by:

$$
\frac{\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|} = -\frac{w_0}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}
$$

Hence, \( w_0 \) shifts the decision boundary closer or farther from the origin based on its value.

%

The decision surface is perpendicular to the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$ and its displacement from the origin is controlled by the bias parameter $w_{0}$. The signed orthogonal distance of a general point $\mathbf{x}$ from the decision surface is given by $\frac{y(\mathbf{x})}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}$.

%

The normal distance from the origin to the decision surface is given by 

$$
\frac{\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|} = -\frac{w_{0}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}

The derivative of the logistic sigmoid function $\sigma$ can be expressed in terms of the sigmoid function itself as:

## How is the likelihood function for given data in a logistic regression model expressed?

For a data set $\left\{\boldsymbol{\phi}_{n}, t_{n}\right\}$, where $\boldsymbol{\phi}_{n}=\boldsymbol{\phi}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}\right)$ and $t_{n} \in \{0, 1\}$, with $n=1, \ldots, N$, the likelihood function can be written as:

$$
p(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{w}) = \prod_{n=1}^{N} y_{n}^{t_{n}}\left\{1-y_{n}\right\}^{1-t_{n}}
$$

where $\mathbf{t}=(t_{1}, \ldots, t_{N})^{\mathrm{T}}$ and $y_{n}=p(\mathcal{C}_{1} \mid \boldsymbol{\phi}_{n})$.

- #statistical-models, #logistic-regression

---

## What is the crossentropy error function for logistic regression?

The crossentropy error function $E(\mathbf{w})$ for logistic regression is derived by taking the negative logarithm of the likelihood function:

$$
E(\mathbf{w}) = -\ln p(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{w}) = -\sum_{n=1}^{N} \left\{ t_{n} \ln y_{n} + (1 - t_{n}) \ln (1 - y_{n}) \right\}
$$

where $y_{n} = \sigma(a_{n})$ and $a_{n} = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}_{n}$.

- #statistical-models, #error-functions

---

## Derive the gradient of the crossentropy error function with respect to the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$.

The gradient of the error function $E(\mathbf{w})$ with respect to the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$ is:

$$
\nabla E(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_{n} - t_{n}) \boldsymbol{\phi}_{n}
$$

Here, $y_{n} = \sigma(a_{n})$ and $a_{n} = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}_{n}$. This gradient is obtained by differentiating the crossentropy error function.

## What condition does the maximum likelihood solution satisfy in logistic regression?

The maximum likelihood solution corresponds to the condition:

$$
\nabla E(\mathbf{w}) = 0
$$

However, due to the nonlinearity in $y(\cdot)$, this equation no longer corresponds to a set of linear equations and does not have a closed-form solution.

- #statistical-models, #logistic-regression

---

## Describe the iterative approach used to find the maximum likelihood solution in logistic regression.

One approach to finding a maximum likelihood solution is **stochastic gradient descent**. In this method, $\nabla E_{n}$ is the $n$th term on the right-hand side of the gradient equation:

$$
\nabla E(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_{n} - t_{n}) \boldsymbol{\phi}_{n}
$$

This technique is useful for training highly nonlinear models, including deep neural networks.

## Explain why the maximum likelihood equation in logistic regression doesn't have a closed-form solution.

The maximum likelihood equation for logistic regression:

$$
\nabla E(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_{n} - t_{n}) \boldsymbol{\phi}_{n}
$$

does not have a closed-form solution because of the nonlinearity in $y(\cdot)$. The resulting equation is inherently nonlinear and requires iterative methods like stochastic gradient descent or IRLS (Iterative Reweighted Least Squares) for solution.

## Why can maximum likelihood exhibit severe over-fitting for linearly separable data sets?

The over-fitting arises because the hyperplane corresponding to $\sigma=0.5$, equivalent to $\mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \phi=0$, separates the two classes, and the magnitude of $\mathbf{w}$ goes to infinity, making the logistic sigmoid function infinitely steep. 

This corresponds to a Heaviside step function, so that every training point from each class $k$ is assigned a posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)=1$.

Maximum likelihood provides no way to favour one solution over another, which in practice will depend on the optimization algorithm and parameter initialization.

## What is the mathematical expression for the posterior probabilities in multi-class logistic regression?

The posterior probabilities are given by the softmax transformation of the linear functions of the feature variables:

$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \boldsymbol{\phi}\right)=y_{k}(\boldsymbol{\phi})=\frac{\exp \left(a_{k}\right)}{\sum_{j} \exp \left(a_{j}\right)}

where $a_{k}$ is defined as:

## What is the derivative of the posterior probability $y_k$ with respect to the pre-activation $a_j$ in multi-class logistic regression?

## Write down the likelihood function using the 1-of-K coding scheme for multi-class logistic regression.

Using the 1-of-K coding scheme, the likelihood function for a feature vector $\phi_n$ belonging to class $\mathcal{C}_k$ is expressed as:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{T} \mid \mathbf{w}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_{K}\right)=\prod_{n=1}^{N} \prod_{k=1}^{K} p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \boldsymbol{\phi}_{n}\right)^{t_{n k}}=\prod_{n=1}^{N} \prod_{k=1}^{K} y_{n k}^{t_{n k}}

```markdown
## What happens to the logistic sigmoid function in the case of severe over-fitting in maximum likelihood?

In the case of severe over-fitting, the magnitude of $\mathbf{w}$ goes to infinity, making the logistic sigmoid function infinitely steep.

This corresponds to a Heaviside step function, where every training point from each class $k$ is assigned a posterior probability of 1:

$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)=1
$$

- #machine-learning, #maximum-likelihood, #logistic-sigmoid

```markdown
## Why does the issue of severe over-fitting in maximum likelihood not depend on the number of data points relative to the number of parameters?

The problem of severe over-fitting arises even if the number of data points is large compared with the number of parameters in the model, as long as the training data set is linearly separable.

This is because the separating hyperplane leads to a continuum of solutions where any hyperplane will give the same posterior probabilities.

## Negative Log Likelihood for Multi-class Classification

Explain the negative log likelihood function for a multi-class classification problem using the given target variable matrix $\mathbf{T}$ and output $y_{nk}$.

The negative log likelihood function for a multi-class classification problem can be expressed as:

$$
E\left(\mathbf{w}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_{K}\right)=-\ln p\left(\mathbf{T} \mid \mathbf{w}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_{K}\right)
$$

Expanding it further gives:

$$
E\left(\mathbf{w}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_{K}\right) = -\sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} t_{n k} \ln y_{n k}
$$

where:

- $\mathbf{T}$ is an $N \times K$ matrix of target variables.
- $y_{nk} = y_k(\boldsymbol{\phi}_n)$ is the predicted output for the $k$-th class and $n$-th data point.
- $t_{nk}$ is the target variable for the $k$-th class and $n$-th data point.

This formulation represents the cross-entropy error function commonly used for multi-class classification tasks.

- #math.statistics, #machine-learning.cross-entropy-error

## Gradient of Error Function

Derive the gradient of the error function with respect to the parameter vector $\mathbf{w}_j$.

Taking the gradient of the error function with respect to the parameter vector $\mathbf{w}_j$, we utilize the derivative properties of the softmax function:

$$
\nabla_{\mathbf{w}_{j}} E\left(\mathbf{w}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_{K}\right) = \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(y_{n j} - t_{n j}\right) \phi_{n}
$$

where:

- $y_{nj}$ is the predicted output for the $j$-th class and $n$-th data point.
- $t_{nj}$ is the target variable for the $j$-th class and $n$-th data point.
- $\phi_n$ is the activation of the basis function for the $n$-th data point.

This gradient is used to optimize the parameters, often through stochastic gradient descent.

- #math.optimization, #machine-learning.gradient

## Cross-entropy Error Function

What is the significance of the cross-entropy error function in multi-class classification problems?

The cross-entropy error function is significant in multi-class classification problems because it quantifies the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual target classes. It is defined as:

$$
E\left(\mathbf{w}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_{K}\right) = -\sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} t_{n k} \ln y_{n k}
$$

This function penalizes predictions that deviate from the actual target classes, making it a more suitable error function for classification tasks compared to the sum-of-squares error function, which is commonly used for regression problems.

- #machine-learning.cross-entropy-error, #classification

## Gradient for Weight $w_{ij}$

Derive the gradient of the error function with respect to the weight $w_{ij}$.

The gradient of the error function with respect to the weight $w_{ij}$, which links the basis function $\phi_{i}(\mathbf{x})$ to the output unit $t_{k}$, can be obtained from:

$$
\frac{\partial E\left(\mathbf{w}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_{K}\right)}{\partial w_{i j}} = \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(y_{n k} - t_{n k}\right) \phi_{i}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}\right)
$$

This gradient takes the form of the product of the output of the basis function $\phi_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{n})$ and the error $\left(y_{n k} - t_{n k}\right)$.

- #math.optimization, #machine-learning.gradient

## Importance of Basis Function in Gradient

Explain why the basis function $\phi_{n}$ is significant in the gradient of the error function.

The basis function $\phi_{n}$ is significant in the gradient of the error function because it captures the activation at the input end of the weight link and influences how the error signal $\left(y_{n j} - t_{n j}\right)$ propagates back through the network. Specifically, the gradient is formulated as:

$$
\nabla_{\mathbf{w}_{j}} E\left(\mathbf{w}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_{K}\right) = \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(y_{n j} - t_{n j}\right) \phi_{n}
$$

This shows that changes in the basis function activations directly impact the gradient, thus influencing the parameter updates during optimization.

- #machine-learning.neural-networks, #optimization

## Consistency of Gradient Form

Why is the gradient of the error function with respect to parameter vectors $\mathbf{w}_j$ significant in understanding linear classification models?

The gradient of the error function with respect to parameter vectors $\mathbf{w}_j$ is significant in understanding linear classification models because it reveals a consistent form similar to other models, such as logistic regression and sum-of-squares error functions. The form:

$$
\nabla_{\mathbf{w}_{j}} E\left(\mathbf{w}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_{K}\right) = \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(y_{n j} - t_{n j}\right) \phi_{n}
$$

illustrates a general principle where the gradient is a product of the error term $\left(y_{n j} - t_{n j}\right)$ and the basis function activation $\phi_{n}$. This consistent form facilitates understanding and application of gradient-based optimization techniques across different models.

E\left(\mathbf{w}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_{K}\right)=-\ln p\left(\mathbf{T} \mid \mathbf{w}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_{K}\right)=-\sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} t_{n k} \ln y_{n k}
$$

where $y_{n k}=y_{k}(\boldsymbol{\phi}_{n})$, and $\mathbf{T}$ is an $N \times K$ matrix of target variables with elements $t_{n k}$.

## Explain the relationship between the probability density function $p(\theta)$ and the cumulative distribution function $f(a)$ as described in the paper.

The probability density function $p(\theta)$, represented by the blue curve, and the cumulative distribution function $f(a)$, represented by the red curve, have a specific relationship:

- The value of $p(\theta)$ at any point corresponds to the slope of $f(a)$ at the same point.
- Conversely, the value of $f(a)$ at a given point is the area under $p(\theta)$ up to that point.

$$
f(a) = \int_{-\infty}^{a} p(\theta) \, d\theta
$$

## Define the activation function $f(a)$ in terms of the cumulative distribution function and explain its role in the stochastic threshold model.

The activation function $f(a)$ is given by the cumulative distribution function of the probability density $p(\theta)$:

$$
f(a) = \int_{-\infty}^{a} p(\theta) \, d\theta
$$

In the stochastic threshold model, the class label $t$ takes the value 1 if $a = \mathbf{w}^\mathrm{T} \phi$ exceeds a threshold $\theta$, and 0 otherwise. This makes $f(a)$ the activation function that translates the linear combination of the feature variables into a probability.

## What does the expression $a = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}$ represent in the context of generalized linear models?

In generalized linear models, the expression $a = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}$ represents a linear combination of the feature variables $\boldsymbol{\phi}$, with $\mathbf{w}$ being the weight vector. This combination $a$ is then used as the argument for the activation function $f(a)$ to determine the class probabilities.

\[
a = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}
\]

## Derive the cumulative distribution function $\Phi(a)$ for a zero-mean, unit-variance Gaussian distribution.

For a zero-mean, unit-variance Gaussian distribution, the cumulative distribution function $\Phi(a)$ is given by:

$$
\Phi(a) = \int_{-\infty}^{a} \mathcal{N}(\theta \mid 0,1) \, d\theta
$$

where $\mathcal{N}(\theta \mid 0, 1)$ denotes the Gaussian probability density function with mean 0 and variance 1.

---

## What is the role of the threshold $\theta$ in the noisy threshold model, and how is it related to the density $p(\theta)$?

In the noisy threshold model:

$$
\begin{cases}t_{n}=1, & \text{if } a_{n} \geqslant \theta \\ t_{n}=0, & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}
$$

The threshold $\theta$ is drawn from a probability density $p(\theta)$. This randomness in $\theta$ introduces noise into the model, which affects the activation function $f(a)$. The resulting activation function is the cumulative distribution function of $p(\theta)$.

$$
f(a) = \int_{-\infty}^{a} p(\theta) \, \mathrm{d} \theta
$$

## Compare the activation function used in logistic regression to the one used in the noisy threshold model as discussed in the paper.

In logistic regression, the activation function is the logistic (sigmoid) function:

$$
f(a) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-a}}
$$

In the noisy threshold model, the activation function is the cumulative distribution function $f(a)$ derived from the probability density $p(\theta)$. For a zero-mean, unit-variance Gaussian, this is the Gaussian cumulative distribution function $\Phi(a)$:

$$
\Phi(a) = \int_{-\infty}^{a} \mathcal{N}(\theta \mid 0,1) \, d\theta
$$

These cards encapsulate key concepts in the section, translating mathematical relationships and their implications in a probabilistic classification context.

## Explain the relationship between the red curve and the blue curve in the context of the provided image.

%

The red curve represents the cumulative distribution function (CDF), while the blue curve represents the probability density function (PDF). The value of the red curve at any given point corresponds to the area under the blue curve up to that point, indicated by the shaded green region. This illustrates the integral relationship between the PDF and the CDF in probabilistic models.

## What determines the class label $t$ in the provided stochastic threshold model?

%

In the stochastic threshold model, the class label $t$ takes the value $t=1$ if the value of $a=\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \phi$ exceeds a specific threshold; otherwise, it takes the value $t=0$. This is equivalent to using a cumulative distribution function $f(a)$ as the activation function.

%

The red curve represents the cumulative distribution function (CDF), while the blue curve represents the probability density function (PDF). The value of the red curve at a specific point corresponds to the area under the blue curve up to that point. This demonstrates how the CDF is an integral of the PDF.

## What occurs to the class label based on the threshold value in the stochastic threshold model described?

![https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_5640d2959c04ab9cdc5eg-1.jpg?height=503&width=654&top_left_y=230&top_left_x=948](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_5640d2959c04ab9cdc5eg-1.jpg?height=503&width=654&top_left_y=230&top_left_x=948)

%

In the stochastic threshold model, the class label $t$ will be 1 if $a = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}$ exceeds a threshold, otherwise, it will be 0. This is mathematically represented by the activation function given by the cumulative distribution function $f(a)$.

### Card 1

## Define and relate the erf function to the Gaussian distribution.

The erf function, or error function, is defined as follows

$$
\operatorname{erf}(a) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{0}^{a} \exp\left(-\theta^{2}\right) \mathrm{d}\theta
$$

Explain how the erf function relates to the Gaussian distribution and the probit function.

The error function (erf) is primarily used to compute probabilities involving the normal distribution. It is derived from the integral of the Gaussian distribution. Specifically, it is defined as:

$$
\operatorname{erf}(a) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{0}^{a} \exp(-\theta^2) \mathrm{d}\theta
$$

It is closely related to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution (which is defined by the probit function $\Phi$):

$$
\Phi(a) = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right)
$$

- #statistics.gaussian-distribution, #functions.error-function, #probability.probit-function


### Card 2

## Define the probit function and explain its significance in the context of regression models.

The probit function $\Phi(a)$ is defined as

$$
\Phi(a) = \frac{1}{2}\left\{1+\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right\}
$$

How does the probit function relate to probit regression, and why is it significant compared to the logistic sigmoid function?

The probit function $\Phi(a)$ is given by:

$$
\Phi(a) = \frac{1}{2}\left\{1 + \operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right\}
$$

Probit regression is a type of regression model where the activation function is a probit function instead of the more commonly used logistic sigmoid function. Probit regression is significant because, although it shares similarities with logistic regression, it behaves differently with respect to outliers. Specifically, the tails of the probit function decay like $\exp(-x^2)$, making it more sensitive to outliers compared to the logistic sigmoid function which decays like $\exp(-x)$.

- #statistics.probit-regression, #math.probit-function, #math.logistic-regression


### Card 3

## Discuss the impact of outliers on probit regression versus logistic regression.

Explain how the tails of the logistic sigmoid function and the probit function affect their sensitivity to outliers.

The tails of the logistic sigmoid function decay asymptotically like $\exp(-x)$, while the tails of the probit function decay like $\exp(-x^2)$. How does this difference impact the sensitivity of probit regression to outliers compared to logistic regression?

In logistic regression, the tails of the sigmoid function decay asymptotically like $\exp(-x)$. However, for the probit function, the tails decay like $\exp(-x^2)$. This difference means that probit regression tends to be more sensitive to outliers. Specifically, points that lie far from the decision boundary can significantly distort the classifier in probit regression due to the slower decay rate of $\exp(-x^2)$ compared to $\exp(-x)$.

### Card 4

## Derive the form of the error function for a linear regression model with Gaussian noise distribution.

Given the error function for a linear regression model with Gaussian noise distribution as negative $\log$ likelihood, derive its form in terms of the parameter vector $\mathbf{w}$.

The error function in a linear regression model with Gaussian noise distribution can be written as the negative $\log$ likelihood. Define and derive its form with respect to the parameter vector $\mathbf{w}$.

For a linear regression model with Gaussian noise distribution, the error function is given by the negative log-likelihood. This can be expressed as:

$$
E(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_n - t_n)^2
$$

where $y_n = \mathbf{w}^T \phi_n$. Taking the derivative with respect to $\mathbf{w}$:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial \mathbf{w}} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_n - t_n) \phi_n
$$

This results in the form where the 'error' $(y_n - t_n)$ is multiplied by the feature vector $\phi_n$.

### Card 5

## Explain the concept of canonical link functions in the context of generalized linear models (GLMs).

What is a canonical link function and how is it applied in the context of GLMs? Discuss the relationship of conditional distributions from the exponential family.

Define the term canonical link function and describe its application in generalized linear models (GLMs). 

A canonical link function is a specific type of link function that is used in generalized linear models (GLMs) to relate the linear predictor to the mean of the distribution function. The choice of the canonical link function is motivated by mathematical convenience and often leads to simplified computations.

For a target variable $t$ with a conditional distribution from the exponential family, the canonical link function ensures that the derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to the linear predictor $\eta$ results in a form involving the 'error' $(y_n - t_n)$ times the feature vector $\phi_n$. This can be generalized as:

$$
p(t \mid \eta, s) = \frac{1}{s} h\left(\frac{t}{s}\right) g(\eta) \exp \left\{\frac{\eta t}{s}\right\}
$$

- #statistics.glm, #math.canonical-link-function, #probability.exponential-family


### Card 6

## Conditional distribution of the target variable in the exponential family.

Consider the following form for the conditional distribution of the target variable from the exponential family:

$$
p(t \mid \eta, s) = \frac{1}{s} h\left(\frac{t}{s}\right) g(\eta) \exp \left\{\frac{\eta t}{s}\right\}
$$

Describe how this form applies to conditional distributions and how it differs from its application to input vectors.

The conditional distribution of the target variable $t$ from the exponential family can be written as:

$$
p(t \mid \eta, s) = \frac{1}{s} h\left(\frac{t}{s}\right) g(\eta) \exp \left\{\frac{\eta t}{s}\right\}
$$

In this form, conditional distributions are assumed for the target variable based on its exponential family. Here, $\eta$ represents the natural parameter, and $s$ is a scale parameter. This contrasts with its application to input vectors, where the distribution is directly applied to the features or data points. This approach is useful in GLMs where the goal is to model the relationship between predictors and the target variable.

- #statistics.exponential-family, #probability.conditional-distribution, #math.glm

## Explain the mathematical relationship between $y$ and $\eta$.

Using the conditional mean of $t$, denoted $y = \mathbb{E}[t \mid \eta]$, the relationship between $y$ and $\eta$ is given by:

$$
y \equiv \mathbb{E}[t \mid \eta] = -s \frac{d}{d\eta} \ln g(\eta)
$$

Given that $y$ and $\eta$ are related, we denote this relationship through $\eta = \psi(y)$.

- #statistics.generalized-linear-model, #mathematics.conditional-expectation

## Define a generalized linear model in the context of this paper.

A generalized linear model is defined as one where $y$ is a nonlinear function of a linear combination of the input (or feature) variables, represented by:

$$
y = f\left(\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}\right)
$$

Here, $f(\cdot)$ is known as the activation function, and $f^{-1}(\cdot)$ is known as the link function.

- #machine-learning.activation-function, #statistics.link-function

## Show the log likelihood function for the model as a function of $\eta$ and explain its components.

The log likelihood function for the model, as a function of $\eta$, is given by:

$$
\ln p(\mathbf{t} \mid \eta, s) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \ln p\left(t_{n} \mid \eta, s\right) = \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{\ln g\left(\eta_{n}\right) + \frac{\eta_{n} t_{n}}{s}\right\} + \text{const}
$$

where:
- $\mathbf{t}$ is the observed data,
- $\eta$ encapsulates the parameters,
- $s$ is the scale parameter,
- $g(\eta)$ is some function related to the distribution of the data.

The term 'const' indicates a constant that does not depend on the parameters.

- #statistics.log-likelihood, #probability.distribution

## Derive the gradient of the log likelihood function with respect to the model parameters $\mathbf{w}$.

The derivative of the log likelihood with respect to the model parameters $\mathbf{w}$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_{\mathbf{w}} \ln p(\mathbf{t} \mid \eta, s) & = \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} \eta_{n}} \ln g\left(\eta_{n}\right)+\frac{t_{n}}{s}\right\} \frac{\mathrm{d} \eta_{n}}{\mathrm{~d} y_{n}} \frac{\mathrm{d} y_{n}}{\mathrm{~d} a_{n}} \nabla_{\mathbf{w}} a_{n} \\
& = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{s}\left\{t_{n}-y_{n}\right\} \psi^{\prime}\left(y_{n}\right) f^{\prime}\left(a_{n}\right) \phi_{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

where:
- $a_{n} = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}_{n}$,
- $y_{n} = f\left(a_{n}\right)$,
- $\psi'(y_n)$ and $f'(a_n)$ are derivatives of the respective functions.

- #statistics.gradient, #machine-learning.parameter-estimation

## Explain the significance of choosing the link function $f^{-1}(y) = \psi(y)$.

Choosing the link function $f^{-1}(y) = \psi(y)$ simplifies the gradient of the error function substantially. This results in:

$$
f(\psi(y)) = y
$$

thus $f^{\prime}(\psi) \psi^{\prime}(y) = 1$, and for $a = \psi(y)$, we have $f^{\prime}(a) \psi^{\prime}(y) = 1$. Consequently, the gradient of the error function reduces to:

$$
\nabla \ln E(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{s} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{y_{n} - t_{n}\right\} \boldsymbol{\phi}_{n}
$$

- #statistics.link-function, #machine-learning.simplification

## What natural pairing is observed between the choice of error function and the output-unit activation function?

There is a natural pairing between the choice of error function and the choice of output-unit activation function. This implies that the form of the link function and consequently the activation function can simplify the gradient of the error function significantly.

Even though this result is derived in the context of single-layer network models, the same considerations apply to deep neural networks discussed in later chapters.

## Explanation of one-versus-the-rest classifier for multiple classes

Describe the concept of one-versus-the-rest classifier for multiple classes. 

This is known as a one-versus-the-rest classifier, where $K-1$ classifiers are trained, each one solving the problem of separating points in a particular class $\mathcal{C}_k$ from points not in that class. This approach can lead to ambiguously classified regions as shown in the left-hand example of Figure 5.2.

## Ambiguities in one-versus-one and one-versus-the-rest classifiers

What are the ambiguities associated with one-versus-one and one-versus-the-rest classifiers?

Both one-versus-one and one-versus-the-rest classifiers lead to ambiguities. In the one-versus-the-rest classifier (left-hand example in Figure 5.2), some regions of input space are ambiguously classified. In the one-versus-one classifier (right-hand example in Figure 5.2), ambiguous regions also occur since multiple discriminant functions can give conflicting outputs.

## Illustration of linear discriminant functions for $K > 2$ classes

Explain the configuration of linear discriminant functions for $K > 2$ classes as a solution. %

The linear discriminant function for $K > 2$ classes can be defined as:
$$
y_k(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}_k^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + w_{k0}
$$
A point $\mathbf{x}$ is assigned to class $\mathcal{C}_k$ if $y_k(\mathbf{x}) > y_j(\mathbf{x})$ for all $j \neq k$. The decision boundary between class $\mathcal{C}_k$ and class $\mathcal{C}_j$ is given by $y_k(\mathbf{x}) = y_j(\mathbf{x})$.

## Decision boundary for $K$-class linear discriminants

Provide the equation for the decision boundary between class $\mathcal{C}_k$ and class $\mathcal{C}_j$ when using $K$-class linear discriminants.

The decision boundary between class $\mathcal{C}_k$ and class $\mathcal{C}_j$ is given by:
$$
y_k(\mathbf{x}) = y_j(\mathbf{x})
$$

## Equation of linear discriminant function

What is the general form of the linear discriminant function in a $K$-class problem?

The general form of the linear discriminant function in a $K$-class problem is:

$$

## Ambiguity in two-class vs multiple-class discriminant functions

How does ambiguity arise when attempting to extend two-class discriminant functions to $K$ classes?

Ambiguity arises when extending two-class discriminant functions to $K$ classes because regions of input space will be classified ambiguously. This happens because more complex boundary interactions occur that the two-class discriminant functions are not designed to handle, as indicated by the green regions in the Figure 5.2 examples.

Explain the concept of ambiguous regions in multi-class classification as illustrated in the given diagrams.

%

The diagrams illustrate ambiguous regions that arise when attempting to construct multi-class classifiers from two-class discriminants. On the left, we see the one-versus-the-rest approach, where the green shaded area indicates uncertain classification—demonstrating that points falling in this area do not get a clear class assignment through this method. On the right, the one-versus-one approach results in an ambiguous region in the center, marked by the green area, due to the intersection of decision boundaries separating each pair of classes. These ambiguities highlight the challenges in multi-class classification using these methods and the need for more robust strategies.

%

Describe the solutions depicted for multi-class classification in the left and right diagrams and their potential pitfalls.

%

The left diagram uses a one-versus-the-rest (OvR) approach, where each discriminant function (solid and dashed red lines) separates one class (e.g., $\mathcal{C}_1$, $\mathcal{C}_2$) from all other classes. The green shaded area represents an ambiguous region where classification is uncertain as it does not clearly belong to either class.

The right diagram employs a one-versus-one (OvO) approach, where each discriminant function separates a pair of classes (e.g., $\mathcal{C}_1$ vs $\mathcal{C}_2$, $\mathcal{C}_1$ vs $\mathcal{C}_3$, $\mathcal{C}_2$ vs $\mathcal{C}_3$). The green-shaded center area indicates an ambiguous region where none of the class separators can confidently classify a point.

Both approaches encounter difficulties in clearly resolving points in these intersection regions, thereby illustrating potential pitfalls in constructing multi-class classifiers based on two-class discriminant functions.

Explain the problems encountered when creating a multi-class classifier using a one-versus-the-rest approach as shown on the left side of Figure 5.2.

%

The one-versus-the-rest approach in multi-class classification can lead to ambiguous regions where the classification is uncertain. In the left diagram of Figure 5.2, regions \(R1\), \(R2\), and \(R3\) correspond to classes \(C1\), \(C2\), and not \(C1\) or \(C2\) respectively. The green-shaded area marks the intersection where a point is neither \(C1\) nor \(C2\). This illustrates the difficulty in assigning a clear class, indicating potential uncertainty.

Describe the challenges depicted in the right side of Figure 5.2 when using a one-versus-one approach for multi-class classification.

%

The one-versus-one approach can also result in ambiguous regions. The right diagram in Figure 5.2 shows three discriminant functions separating pairs of classes \(C1\), \(C2\), and \(C3\). The green-shaded area in the center, where decision boundaries intersect, represents regions of ambiguity. Here, the overlapping influences of decision boundaries showcase the potential confusion and difficulty in assigning a definitive class label to the points within these regions.

## What does the equation $(\mathbf{w}_{k}-\mathbf{w}_{j})^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + (w_{k0} - w_{j0}) = 0$ represent?

This equation defines a $(D-1)$-dimensional hyperplane, acting as a decision boundary between classes $k$ and $j$.

$$
(\mathbf{w}_{k}-\mathbf{w}_{j})^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + (w_{k0} - w_{j0}) = 0
$$

- $\mathbf{w}_{k}$ and $\mathbf{w}_{j}$ are weight vectors.
- $w_{k0}$ and $w_{j0}$ are biases.
- $\mathbf{x}$ is the input vector.

This form is similar to the two-class decision boundary, highlighting the geometric properties of linear discriminants.

- #mathematics.linear-algebra, #classification.linear-discriminant-analysis

## Explain why the decision regions of a multi-class linear discriminant are always singly connected and convex.

Based on the linearity of discriminant functions, for two points $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}$ in decision region $\mathcal{R}_{k}$, any point $\widehat{\mathbf{x}}$ on the line connecting them lies within $\mathcal{R}_{k}$. This implies:

$$
\widehat{\mathbf{x}} = \lambda \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{A}} + (1 - \lambda) \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}, \quad 0 \leq \lambda \leq 1
$$

The linearity ensures that:

$$
y_{k}(\widehat{\mathbf{x}}) = \lambda y_{k}(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{A}}) + (1 - \lambda) y_{k}(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}})
$$

Since $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}$ belong to $\mathcal{R}_{k}$, $\widehat{\mathbf{x}}$ must also lie in $\mathcal{R}_{k}$, ensuring $\mathcal{R}_{k}$ is singly connected and convex.

- #mathematics.geomery, #classification.linear-discriminant-analysis

## How is 1-of-$K$ coding (or one-hot encoding) used in classification problems for $K > 2$ classes?

In 1-of-$K$ (one-hot) encoding for $K > 2$ class classification, the target variable $\mathbf{t}$ is a vector of length $K$. If the instance belongs to class $\mathcal{C}_{j}$, then $t_{j} = 1$ and all other elements $t_{k}$ are zero:

$$
\mathbf{t} = [0, 0, \ldots, 1, \ldots, 0] \quad \text{(1 at the $j$-th position)}
$$

This method differentiates each class distinctly with a unique vector representation.

- #classification.one-hot-encoding, #data-representation

## How can we interpret the target variable $t$ in a two-class classification problem?

In two-class classification, the target variable $t \in \{0,1\}$ represents class labels:

$$
t = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{for class } \mathcal{C}_1 \\
0 & \text{for class } \mathcal{C}_2 
\end{cases}
$$

This binary encoding implies the probability of being in class $\mathcal{C}_1$ when $t=1$, and $\mathcal{C}_2$ when $t=0$.

- #classification.binary-encoding, #classification.probability-representation

## Derive the expression for a point $\widehat{\mathbf{x}}$ on the line connecting two points $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}$ in the same decision region.

A point $\widehat{\mathbf{x}}$ on the line connecting $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}$ in the decision region $\mathcal{R}_{k}$ can be expressed as a convex combination:

$$
\widehat{\mathbf{x}} = \lambda \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{A}} + (1 - \lambda) \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}, \quad 0 \leq \lambda \leq 1
$$

This ensures $\widehat{\mathbf{x}}$ lies in $\mathcal{R}_{k}$, maintaining the region as singly connected and convex.

- #mathematics.linear-combination, #classification.decision-regions

## What is the form of the linear discriminant function $y_k(\mathbf{x})$ used in multiclass classification?

For multiclass classification, the linear discriminant function for class $k$ is given by:

$$
y_k(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}_k^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + w_{k0}
$$

- $\mathbf{w}_k$ is the weight vector for class $k$.
- $w_{k0}$ is the bias term for class $k$.
- $\mathbf{x}$ is the input vector.

Explain the convexity and single connectedness of the decision regions in a multi-class linear discriminant as illustrated in Figure 5.3.

%

If two points $\mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{B}}$ both lie inside the same decision region $\mathcal{R}_{k}$, then any point $\widehat{\mathrm{x}}$ that lies on the line connecting these two points must also lie in $\mathcal{R}_{k}$, indicating that the decision region is singly connected and convex.

Derive the expression for an intermediate point $\widehat{\mathbf{x}}$ on the line connecting points $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}$ within the same decision region $\mathcal{R}_{k}$.

%

The intermediate point $\widehat{\mathbf{x}}$ on the line connecting $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}$ can be expressed as follows:

$$
\widehat{\mathbf{x}}=\lambda \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{A}}+(1-\lambda) \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{B}}

% 

The decision regions for a multi-class linear discriminant are composed of separate, convex decision regions demarcated by decision boundaries (in red). If two points $\mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{B}}$ lie within the same decision region $\mathcal{R}_{k}$, any point $\widehat{\mathrm{x}}$ on the line connecting these points will also lie in $\mathcal{R}_{k}$, proving the region's convex nature.

## Card 2

Describe the formula defining a $(D-1)$-dimensional hyperplane as a decision boundary in a multi-class discriminant scenario based on the given text and image.

%

The decision boundary for a multi-class linear discriminant is represented by the $(D-1)$-dimensional hyperplane, given by:

$$
\left(\mathbf{w}_{k}-\mathbf{w}_{j}\right)^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}+\left(w_{k 0}-w_{j 0}\right)=0
$$

It shares the same form as the decision boundary in a two-class case, where analogous geometrical properties apply. This hyperplane divides the input space into distinct, convex decision regions.

## What is the target vector for a data point from class 2 if \( K=5 \) classes using a 1-of-K binary coding scheme?

The target vector is:

$$
\mathbf{t}=(0,1,0,0,0)^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

The element $t_{j}$, corresponding to the class label, takes the value 1, while all other elements are 0.

- #classification, #coding-scheme.one-of-k

## Explain the least squares approach for classification and its key limitation.

Least squares for classification aims to approximate the conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}]$. Specifically, for a general classification problem with $K$ classes and a 1-of-K binary coding scheme, the least squares method attempts to minimize a sum-of-squares error function.

**Key Limitation:** The approximations of the posterior class probabilities can have values outside the range $(0,1)$, leading to poor probabilistic interpretations.

- #classification, #least-squares.limitation

---

## Write the equation for the linear model associated with class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$.

The linear model for class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ is:

$$
y_{k}(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{w}_{k}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + w_{k 0}
$$

where $k=1, \ldots, K$.

- #classification, #linear-model.class

---

## What is the sum-of-squares error function for the classification problem?

The sum-of-squares error function is given by:

$$
E_{D}(\widetilde{\mathbf{W}}) = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{Tr}\left\{ (\widetilde{\mathbf{X}} \widetilde{\mathbf{W}} - \mathbf{T})^{\mathrm{T}} (\widetilde{\mathbf{X}} \widetilde{\mathbf{W}} - \mathbf{T}) \right\}
$$

where $\widetilde{\mathbf{W}}$ is the parameter matrix, $\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}$ is the matrix of augmented input vectors, and $\mathbf{T}$ is the matrix of target vectors.

- #classification, #error-function.sum-of-squares

---

## Derive the closed-form solution for the parameter matrix $\widetilde{\mathbf{W}}$ in least squares classification.

Setting the derivative of the error function with respect to $\widetilde{\mathbf{W}}$ to zero and rearranging, we get:

$$
\widetilde{\mathbf{W}} = \left( \widetilde{\mathbf{X}}^{\mathrm{T}} \widetilde{\mathbf{X}} \right)^{-1} \widetilde{\mathbf{X}}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{T}
$$

Alternatively,

$$
\widetilde{\mathbf{W}} = \widetilde{\mathbf{X}}^{\dagger} \mathbf{T}
$$

where $\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}^{\dagger}$ is the pseudo-inverse of $\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}$.

- #classification, #parameter-solution.closed-form

---

## Explain the notation and components in the equation \(\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x}) = \widetilde{\mathbf{W}}^{\mathrm{T}} \widetilde{\mathbf{x}}\).

- $\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x})$: Vector of outputs for each class $\mathcal{C}_k$.
- $\widetilde{\mathbf{W}}$: Matrix whose $k$-th column is the augmented weight vector $\widetilde{\mathbf{w}_k}$.
- $\widetilde{\mathbf{x}}$: Augmented input vector $\left(1, \mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{T}}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}$ with a dummy input $x_0 = 1$.

This equation groups individual linear models into a vector form, facilitating easier computation and evaluation.

- #classification, #vector-notation.augmented

## Given the least-squares solution for a function

$$
\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x})=\widetilde{\mathbf{W}}^{\mathrm{T}} \widetilde{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{T}}\left(\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}^{\dagger}\right)^{\mathrm{T}} \widetilde{\mathbf{x}}
$$

Show that for any target vector $\mathbf{t}_n$ satisfying a linear constraint $\mathbf{a}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{t}_{n} + b = 0$, the model prediction $\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x})$ satisfies $\mathbf{a}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x}) + b = 0$.

The proof starts with the assumed linear constraint and uses the given least-squares solution form.

$$
\mathbf{a}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{t}_{n} + b = 0 \implies \mathbf{a}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{T}} (\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}^{\dagger})^{\mathrm{T}} \widetilde{\mathbf{x}} + b = 0 \implies \mathbf{a}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x}) + b = 0
$$

This completes the proof that the model prediction upholds the same linear constraint as the target vector.

- #math.linear-algebra, #machine-learning.models, #least-squares

## Show that if we use a 1-of-$K$ coding scheme for $K$ classes in the least-squares solution, the elements of $\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x})$ will sum to 1.

By using the linear constraint from the target vectors, we reach the following summation result.

Section 2.3 .4 mentions $$
\mathbf{a}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x}) + b = 0
$$

If $\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x})$ elements sum to 1 and $\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{1}$, then 

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{k}(\mathbf{x}) = 1
$$

This result ensures the sum constraint for the least-squares solutions using a 1-of-$K$ coding scheme.

## Explain why the least-squares approach suffers from severe problems even when used as a discriminant function without probabilistic interpretation.

The least-squares method is sensitive to the distribution and presence of outliers, which affects its robustness. 

This is emphasized by its underpinning sum-of-squares error function: 

$$
E(\mathbf{W}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left(\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x}_n) - \mathbf{t}_n\right)^2
$$

This leads to issues when data is not Gaussian distributed, impacting decision boundaries adversely when outliers are present.

- #machine-learning.robustness, #statistics.error-functions, #least-squares

## Describe an issue with using least-squares under the assumption of Gaussian noise distribution when it is markedly different for the true data.

Least-squares corresponds to the maximum likelihood under the Gaussian noise assumption. If the data is not Gaussian, this misalignment will cause poor classification performance, especially sensitive to outliers.

$$
P(\mathbf{t}|\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{W}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{t}|\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x}), \sigma^2)
$$

Where $\mathcal{N}$ denotes the Gaussian distribution.

## Highlight how logistic regression demonstrates more robustness compared to least-squares according to Figure 5.4.

Logistic regression is less sensitive to outliers compared to least-squares, demonstrating better decision boundary stability as illustrated in Figure 5.4. This robustness is due to its probabilistic framework:

$$
\text{Logistic Regression: } \sigma(\mathbf{w}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{x}) \text{, where } \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}
$$

Compared to the sum-of-squares error giving undue weight to outliers.

- #machine-learning.logistic-regression, #statistics.robustness, #least-squares

## Discuss how probabilistic models improve classification techniques over least-squares and pave the way for flexible nonlinear neural network models.

By using probabilistic models, one can adjust assumptions to better fit the data structure, reducing sensitivity to outliers and allowing flexibility in modeling.

Future sections will delve into

$$
P(\mathbf{t}|\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{W}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{t}|\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x}), \sigma^2)
$$

Transforming this into neural networks for better flexibility and prediction accuracy.

### Card 1:
## What are the key stages of the machine learning process in the context of classifiers?

## The machine learning process in the context of classifiers can be broken down into two stages:
- Inference: Determining the joint probability distribution $p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t})$ from a set of training data. This provides a complete summary of the uncertainty associated with the variables.
- Decision: Making a specific prediction for the value of $t$ or taking a specific action based on the understanding of the values $t$ is likely to take.

- #machine-learning, #classification, #decision-theory

### Card 2:
## Describe the differences between regression problems and classification problems in terms of the target variable $\mathbf{t}$.

## In regression problems, the target variable $\mathbf{t}$:
- Comprises continuous variables
- Is often a vector if we aim to predict several related quantities

In classification problems, the target variable $\mathbf{t}$:
- Represents class labels 
- Is generally a vector if there are more than two classes

- #regression, #classification, #target-variable

### Card 3:
## What does the joint probability distribution $p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t})$ represent, and why is it important?

## The joint probability distribution $p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t})$ provides a complete summary of the uncertainty associated with the input vector $\mathbf{x}$ and the target vector $\mathbf{t}$. 

It is important because determining $p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t})$ from a set of training data is a critical part of the inference stage in machine learning. This understanding helps in making accurate predictions or decisions based on the data.

### Card 4:
## How do least squares and logistic regression models differ in their sensitivity to outliers?

% Figure 5.4 illustrates the discussed scenario, but consider the textual explanation.

## Least squares regression is highly sensitive to outliers, as they can significantly affect the decision boundaries. In contrast, logistic regression is more robust and less sensitive to outliers. This is evident when extra data points are added at the bottom right of the diagram, affecting the least squares boundary but not the logistic regression boundary.

### Card 5:
## In a practical application involving decision theory, what is often required, and what does this aspect emphasize?

## In practical applications of decision theory, it is often required to:
- Make a specific prediction for the value of $t$.
- Take a specific action based on the values $t$ is likely to take.

This aspect emphasizes making informed decisions based on the inference drawn from data, such as using the probability distribution $p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t})$.

### Card 6:
## Using the example of medical diagnosis, explain the inputs and focus of decision theory.

% Consider the example of determining cancer from an image of a skin lesion.

## In the context of medical diagnosis:
- The input vector $\mathbf{x}$ consists of the set of pixel intensities from the image of a skin lesion.
- The focus of decision theory is to predict whether the patient has cancer (classification problem) and take action based on this prediction (such as further medical tests or treatments).

## Evaluate the impact of outliers on different classification methods using the illustrated plots

%

The left-hand plot shows data points from two classes (red crosses and blue circles) and the decision boundaries determined by least squares (magenta curve) and logistic regression (green curve). The right-hand plot, which includes additional data points at the bottom right, demonstrates that the least squares method's decision boundary is highly sensitive to these outliers, unlike the logistic regression method which remains relatively unaffected.

%

The image depicts two plots where the right plot demonstrates that the decision boundary derived from logistic regression (green curve) is much less affected by outliers compared to the decision boundary from the least squares method (magenta curve). This indicates that logistic regression is more robust to outliers and can maintain reliable classification results in their presence.

Describe how the decision boundaries differ for least squares and logistic regression when outliers are present.

%

The magenta curve represents the decision boundary found by the least squares method, and the green curve represents that found by logistic regression. When outliers are added (right plot), the magenta decision boundary from the least squares method is significantly influenced, moving away from its position in the left plot. In contrast, the green decision boundary from the logistic regression model is much less affected, indicating its robustness to outliers.

What does the visual demonstration of decision boundaries indicate about the reliability of classification results using least squares versus logistic regression?

The visual demonstrates that the least squares method is highly sensitive to outliers, potentially leading to less reliable classification results. In contrast, logistic regression appears to be more resilient to such anomalies, maintaining more stable and reliable decision boundaries despite the presence of outliers.

### Card 1

## Explain the goal of decision theory in the context of classifying the presence or absence of cancer.

% 

The goal of decision theory in this context is to make optimal decisions about whether to give treatment to a patient based on the probabilistic analysis of an observed variable (the skin image). Given the image $\mathbf{x}$, we aim to decide whether it belongs to class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ (absence of cancer) or class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ (presence of cancer). The optimal decision rule is derived based on the probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x})$, where $\mathbf{C}_{k}$ represents the class.

- #decision-theory, #probability, #classification

### Card 2

## How can Bayes' theorem be used to determine the posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$?

$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)=\frac{p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)}{p(\mathbf{x})}
$$

% 

Bayes' theorem allows us to express the posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$ as:

$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)=\frac{p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)}{p(\mathbf{x})}
$$

Here:
- $p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right)$ is the likelihood of the image given class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$.
- $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)$ is the prior probability of class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$.
- $p(\mathbf{x})$ is the marginal likelihood of observing the image $\mathbf{x}$, which can be calculated as $p(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{k} p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}) p(\mathcal{C}_{k})$.

This theorem updates our prior beliefs with new evidence $\mathbf{x}$ to produce the posterior probability.

### Card 3

## Describe the misclassification rate and its importance in decision theory. 

%

The misclassification rate is the proportion of instances where the classification rule assigns the wrong class to an input. It is a critical criterion for evaluating the performance of a decision rule. Minimizing the misclassification rate means that fewer errors are made, which is essential in applications such as diagnosing cancer, where incorrect classification could have significant consequences.

- #decision-theory, #misclassification-rate, #evaluation-metrics

### Card 4

## What are decision regions and decision boundaries in the context of classification?

%

Decision regions are areas in the input space where, based on the classification rule, all input points are assigned to the same class. The boundaries between these decision regions are known as decision boundaries or decision surfaces. These boundaries determine the points at which the classification rule changes from one class to another.

- #decision-theory, #classification, #decision-regions

### Card 5

## In the context of cancer classification, explain the relationship between prior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_{k})$ and posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$.

%

The prior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_{k})$ represents the initial belief about the likelihood of class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ before considering any new evidence (such as a patient's skin image $\mathbf{x}$). The posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$, on the other hand, is the updated probability of class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ after taking the new evidence into account using Bayes' theorem. It essentially revises the prior probability in light of the observed data $\mathbf{x}$.

- #probability, #bayes-theorem, #classification

### Card 6

## What criterion should be used if the goal is to minimize the misclassification rate in the decision-making process?

%

If the goal is to minimize the misclassification rate, the criterion used should be to assign each input $\mathbf{x}$ to the class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ with the highest posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$. This approach ensures that each input is classified in the way that is most likely to be correct, given the observed data.
