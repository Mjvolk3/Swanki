The left plot shows the class-conditional densities for two classes (red and blue). The right plot represents the posterior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_{1} \mid \mathbf{x})$, which is a logistic sigmoid of a linear function of $\mathbf{x}$. The surface is colored with red and blue ink proportions correlating to the probability of $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{2}$.

## How is the decision boundary visualized in Figure 5.13's right plot?

The decision boundary in the right plot is visualized by the transition between red and blue colors, representing a mixture of posterior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_{1} \mid \mathbf{x})$ and $1 - p(\mathcal{C}_{1} \mid \mathbf{x})$. The decision boundary itself is linear, occurring where the posterior probabilities are equal.
