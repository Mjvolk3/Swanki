A confusion matrix is a table used to describe the performance of a classification algorithm. It outlines the following key components:

- **True Negatives (TN)**: Instances correctly identified as 'normal' (no cancer).
- **False Positives (FP)**: Instances incorrectly classified as 'cancer' when they are 'normal'.
- **False Negatives (FN)**: Instances incorrectly classified as 'normal' when they are 'cancer'.
- **True Positives (TP)**: Instances correctly identified as 'cancer'.

From this matrix, various performance metrics can be derived:

- **Accuracy**: $(\text{TP} + \text{TN}) / (\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN})$
- **Precision (Positive Predictive Value)**: $\text{TP} / (\text{TP} + \text{FP})$
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: $\text{TP} / (\text{TP} + \text{FN})$
- **Specificity**: $\text{TN} / (\text{TN} + \text{FP})$
- **F1 Score**: $2 \times (\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}) / (\text{Precision} + \text{Recall})$

These metrics help in understanding both the overall accuracy of the classifier and the types of errors it makes (type 1 or type 2 errors).

## What do the elements True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), and True Positive (TP) signify in a confusion matrix?

The elements of a confusion matrix represent the following:

- **True Negatives (TN)**: The number of instances correctly classified as negative (no cancer).
- **False Positives (FP)**: The number of instances incorrectly classified as positive (cancer) when they are negative (no cancer).
- **False Negatives (FN)**: The number of instances incorrectly classified as negative (no cancer) when they are positive (cancer).
- **True Positives (TP)**: The number of instances correctly classified as positive (cancer).

These values are instrumental in evaluating the performance of a classifier, specifically in terms of its ability to correctly identify and misclassify instances.
