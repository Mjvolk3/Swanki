The ROC curve is a plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier as its discrimination threshold is varied. It represents the trade-off between the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The better the classifier, the larger the area under the ROC curve.

## How do the blue and red curves on the ROC plot compare in terms of classifier performance?

The blue curve represents a superior classifier with a higher true positive rate (TPR) for the same false positive rate (FPR) compared to the red curve. The red curve indicates a classifier with performance between random guessing (dashed line) and the better blue curve. The area under the blue curve is greater, indicating better overall performance.
