Label the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative regions in the given probability density functions (pdfs) graph for classes C1 and C2.

%

True negative (TN): Region A

False negative (FN): Region B

False positive (FP): Region C

True positive (TP): Region D

Note: Region E is an extension of the true positive area under the pdf for class C2.

## Card 2

Describe the significance of the decision boundary \( x_0 \) in the given classification task.

%

The decision boundary \( x_0 \) separates the classification regions \( \mathcal{R}_1 \) assigned to class C1 (normal) and \( \mathcal{R}_2 \) assigned to class C2 (cancer). The placement of \( x_0 \) determines which values of the measurement x will be classified as C1 or C2, thus influencing the trade-off between false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN). Adjusting \( x_0 \) changes the sizes and shapes of the regions, affecting the classification outcomes and the performance measures like sensitivity and specificity.
