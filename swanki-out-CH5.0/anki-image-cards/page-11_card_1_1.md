## Anki Card 1

What are the joint probabilities \( p(x, \mathcal{C}_{k}) \) and how do they define the decision region in the context of two-class classification?

Joint probabilities \( p(x, \mathcal{C}_{k}) \) are used to define decision regions for two-class classification by plotting them against the input variable \( x \). The decision boundary \( x = \widehat{x} \) separates the two regions: 
- \( x \geq \widehat{x} \): classified as class \( \mathcal{C}_{2} \) (decision region \( \mathcal{R}_{2} \))
- \( x < \widehat{x} \): classified as class \( \mathcal{C}_{1} \) (decision region \( \mathcal{R}_{1} \))

Classification errors arise from overlapping distributions:
- For \( x < \widehat{x} \), errors occur when class \( \mathcal{C}_{2} \) is misclassified as \( \mathcal{C}_{1} \) (red and green areas).
- For \( x \geq \widehat{x} \), errors occur when class \( \mathcal{C}_{1} \) is misclassified as \( \mathcal{C}_{2} \) (blue area).

Explain the impact and optimization of the decision boundary \( x = \widehat{x} \) in minimizing classification errors in a two-class problem.

The decision boundary \( x = \widehat{x} \) is critical in minimizing classification errors in a two-class problem. The boundary is optimized at the point where the two class probability distributions intersect. This intersection, denoted \( x = x_{0} \), achieves the most accurate classification by ensuring values of \( x \geq x_{0} \) are assigned to class \( \mathcal{C}_{2} \) and values of \( x < x_{0} \) are assigned to class \( \mathcal{C}_{1} \).

Optimization results:
- Minimized overlapping region (red region disappears).
- The decision rule ensures classification corresponds to the highest posterior probability \( p(\mathcal{C}_{k} | x) \) for each \( x \).
