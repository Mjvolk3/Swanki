The red curve represents the cumulative distribution function (CDF), while the blue curve represents the probability density function (PDF). The value of the red curve at any given point corresponds to the area under the blue curve up to that point, indicated by the shaded green region. This illustrates the integral relationship between the PDF and the CDF in probabilistic models.

## What determines the class label $t$ in the provided stochastic threshold model?

In the stochastic threshold model, the class label $t$ takes the value $t=1$ if the value of $a=\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \phi$ exceeds a specific threshold; otherwise, it takes the value $t=0$. This is equivalent to using a cumulative distribution function $f(a)$ as the activation function.
