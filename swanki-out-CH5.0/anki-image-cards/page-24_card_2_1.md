The left-hand plot shows the class-conditional densities for three classes, each having a Gaussian distribution and colored red, green, and blue. The red and blue classes share the same covariance matrix, resulting in a linear decision boundary between these two classes. The green class has a different covariance matrix, which results in quadratic decision boundaries between the green class and the other two classes.

## What do the colors and white dashed lines represent in the right-hand plot?

In the right-hand plot, the colors represent the posterior probabilities for the three classes at each point, with the colors red, blue, and green corresponding to the respective classes. The white dashed lines indicate the decision boundaries, where the posterior probabilities of neighboring classes are equal.
