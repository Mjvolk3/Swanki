## What does the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve illustrate about classifier performance?

The ROC curve illustrates the trade-off between the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) for different threshold settings of a binary classifier. It helps to evaluate and compare the performance of classifiers by plotting:

- The TPR on the y-axis.
- The FPR on the x-axis.

Key points:
1. The upper blue curve indicates a superior classifier with higher TPR for the same FPR compared to the lower red curve.
2. The red curve represents a classifier with intermediate performance.
3. The dashed line (slope of 1) represents a random classifier's performance.

Overall, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) quantifies a classifierâ€™s performance, where a higher AUC represents a better classifier.

## Why is the blue curve considered a better classifier than the red curve in the ROC graph?

The blue curve in the ROC graph is considered a better classifier than the red curve because it:

1. Maintains a consistently higher true positive rate (TPR) for any given false positive rate (FPR).
2. Results in a greater Area Under the Curve (AUC), indicating better overall performance.

The blue curve shows that the classifier is more accurate at distinguishing between the positive and negative classes across different thresholds.
