    What are the regions $\mathcal{R}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{R}_{2}$ assigned to in the cancer classification problem?
    
    %
    
    In the cancer classification problem:
    
    - Region $\mathcal{R}_{1}$ is assigned to the normal class.
    - Region $\mathcal{R}_{2}$ is assigned to the cancer class.

    In the graph, what do regions B and C represent in terms of classification outcomes?
    
    %
    
    - Region B represents false negatives (FN), where instances of class C2 (cancer) are incorrectly classified as class C1 (normal).
    - Region C represents false positives (FP), where instances of class C1 (normal) are incorrectly classified as class C2 (cancer).
