The elements of the confusion matrix represent the following:

- **True Negatives (TN)**: The number of instances correctly identified as 'normal' (no cancer).
- **False Positives (FP)**: The number of instances incorrectly classified as 'cancer' when they are actually 'normal'.
- **False Negatives (FN)**: The number of instances incorrectly classified as 'normal' when they are actually 'cancer'.
- **True Positives (TP)**: The number of instances correctly identified as 'cancer'.

## How can the confusion matrix be utilized to compute key performance metrics of a classifier in medical diagnosis?

The confusion matrix can be utilized to compute the following key performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.
\[
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + FN + TN}
\]

- **Precision** (also called Positive Predictive Value): The proportion of positive test outcomes that are true positives.
\[
\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
\]

- **Recall** (also called Sensitivity or True Positive Rate): The proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.
\[
\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
\]

- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
\[
F1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
\]

- **ROC Curve and AUC**: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots the true positive rate (Recall) against the false positive rate (1 - Specificity) at various threshold settings, and its Area Under the Curve (AUC) gives an aggregate measure of performance across all thresholds.
