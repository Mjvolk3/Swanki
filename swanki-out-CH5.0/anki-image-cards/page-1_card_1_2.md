Identify the main goal in classification problems as introduced in the text.

%
The goal in classification is to take an input vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$ and assign it to one of $K$ discrete classes $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ where $k=1, \ldots, K$.

Explain the significance of studying single-layer neural networks for classification before moving on to more complex models.

%
Studying single-layer neural networks for classification allows us to introduce many of the key concepts of classification in a simpler context before dealing with more general deep neural networks in later chapters.
