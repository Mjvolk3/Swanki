The right-hand plot uses proportional coloring (red, blue, and green ink) to represent the posterior probabilities of the respective three classes. Each point on the image is colored based on the posterior probabilities of the red, blue, and green classes. The decision boundaries between classes are also shown, with the boundary between the red and blue classes being linear due to shared covariance matrices, and the boundaries between the red and green classes, as well as the blue and green classes, being quadratic because of different covariance matrices.

## Why is the decision boundary between the red and blue classes linear in Figure 5.14, while the boundaries between the other pairs of classes are quadratic?

The decision boundary between the red and blue classes is linear because they share the same covariance matrix, leading to linear decision boundaries. In contrast, the boundaries between the red and green classes, as well as the blue and green classes, are quadratic due to the different covariance matrices of these classes.
