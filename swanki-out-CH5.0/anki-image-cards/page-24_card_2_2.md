The left plot shows the class-conditional densities for three classes (red, green, and blue), with Gaussian distributions, where red and blue classes share the same covariance matrix. The right plot depicts the posterior probabilities, where each point is colored in accordance with the posterior probabilities of the three classes. The decision boundaries illustrate linear separation between red and blue (same covariance) and quadratic boundaries for other pairs (different covariances).

The decision boundaries in the right-hand plot delineate the regions for the respective classes based on posterior probabilities. The boundary between the red and blue classes is linear due to their shared covariance matrix. In contrast, the boundaries between the green class and the other classes are quadratic, resulting from different covariance matrices.
