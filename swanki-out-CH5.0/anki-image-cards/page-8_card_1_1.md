The left-hand plot shows data points from two classes (red crosses and blue circles) and the decision boundaries determined by least squares (magenta curve) and logistic regression (green curve). The right-hand plot, which includes additional data points at the bottom right, demonstrates that the least squares method's decision boundary is highly sensitive to these outliers, unlike the logistic regression method which remains relatively unaffected.

## Describe the robustness of logistic regression compared to least squares in the classification task illustrated.

The image depicts two plots where the right plot demonstrates that the decision boundary derived from logistic regression (green curve) is much less affected by outliers compared to the decision boundary from the least squares method (magenta curve). This indicates that logistic regression is more robust to outliers and can maintain reliable classification results in their presence.
