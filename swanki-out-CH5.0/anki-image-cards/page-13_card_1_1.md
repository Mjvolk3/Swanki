The reject option in classification is used to defer decisions for inputs $x$ where the largest posterior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_k \mid x)$ is less than or equal to a threshold $\theta$. This means that if neither class's posterior probability exceeds $\theta$, the classifier opts to reject the decision rather than risking an incorrect classification. This is visually represented in Figure 5.7, where the region below $\theta$ is marked as the "reject region".
