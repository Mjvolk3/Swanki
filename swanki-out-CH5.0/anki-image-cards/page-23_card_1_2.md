What do the left and right plots represent in Figure 5.13?

### Back Side of Card 1

The left plot shows the class-conditional densities of two classes (red and blue) in a two-dimensional input space. The right plot shows the posterior probability \( p(\mathcal{C}_1 \mid \mathbf{x}) \), represented as a logistic sigmoid of a linear function of \( \mathbf{x} \). The colors indicate the mixture of posterior probabilities between the two classes: red for class \( \mathcal{C}_1 \) and blue for class \( \mathcal{C}_2 \).

Explain the significance of the colors in the right plot of Figure 5.13.

### Back Side of Card 2

In the right plot, the surface is colored using a proportion of red ink given by \( p(\mathcal{C}_1 \mid \mathbf{x}) \) and a proportion of blue ink given by \( p(\mathcal{C}_2 \mid \mathbf{x}) = 1 - p(\mathcal{C}_1 \mid \mathbf{x}) \). This indicates the posterior probabilities for the two classes. Areas with higher red intensity indicate higher probabilities for class \( \mathcal{C}_1 \) (red), while areas with higher blue intensity indicate higher probabilities for class \( \mathcal{C}_2 \) (blue).
