Describe how the decision boundaries differ for least squares and logistic regression when outliers are present.

%

The magenta curve represents the decision boundary found by the least squares method, and the green curve represents that found by logistic regression. When outliers are added (right plot), the magenta decision boundary from the least squares method is significantly influenced, moving away from its position in the left plot. In contrast, the green decision boundary from the logistic regression model is much less affected, indicating its robustness to outliers.

What does the visual demonstration of decision boundaries indicate about the reliability of classification results using least squares versus logistic regression?

%

The visual demonstrates that the least squares method is highly sensitive to outliers, potentially leading to less reliable classification results. In contrast, logistic regression appears to be more resilient to such anomalies, maintaining more stable and reliable decision boundaries despite the presence of outliers.
