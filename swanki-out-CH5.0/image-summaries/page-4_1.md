ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image contains two diagrams illustrating the concept of ambiguous regions that can arise when constructing multi-class classifiers from combinations of two-class discriminants. The diagrams are designed to visually explain the challenges encountered in multi-class classification when using a one-versus-the-rest approach (on the left) and a one-versus-one approach (on the right).

On the left side of the image, there are three regions labeled \( R1 \), \( R2 \), and \( R3 \), each corresponding to a different class represented by \( C1 \), \( C2 \), and not \( C1 \) or not \( C2 \) respectively. The green shaded area marks the ambiguous region where the classification is uncertain because it is the intersection of the regions where a point is neither \( C1 \) nor \( C2 \) explicitly. This demonstrates the challenge with the one-versus-the-rest approach, where there could be areas of the input space that do not get a clear class assignment.

On the right side of the image, a different scenario is depicted involving three discriminant functions used to separate each pair of classes, \( C1 \), \( C2 \), and \( C3 \). In this one-versus-one approach, the green shaded area in the center illustrates an ambiguous region once again. This area is the intersection of the decision boundaries, which shows the possible confusion in class assignments that could arise from this method.

Both diagrams use solid and dashed red lines to represent the decision boundaries between the classes or comparisons in question. The question mark in the green area in both diagrams emphasizes the ambiguity in classifying points that fall within these regions. The diagrams serve to show why solely relying on these methods can lead to areas of input space where the class label is ambiguous and highlights the need for other approaches to construct a robust multi-class classifier.
