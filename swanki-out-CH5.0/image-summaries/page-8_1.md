ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image displays two plots which illustrate the decision boundaries for a classification problem with two classes. The two classes of data points are represented by red crosses and blue circles. On the left plot, a magenta curve and a green curve indicate the decision boundaries resulting from two different classification methods: least squares and logistic regression, respectively. On the right plot, additional data points have been added to the bottom right corner, showing how the magenta decision boundary from the least squares method has been significantly influenced by these outliers, moving away from the original position seen in the left plot. The green decision boundary from the logistic regression method appears to be much less affected by these added points, indicating its robustness to outliers. This visual demonstrates how the least squares method can be sensitive to data points that lie far from the main cluster of data, potentially leading to less reliable classification results compared to logistic regression, which seems more resilient to such anomalies.
