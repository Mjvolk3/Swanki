ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image illustrates the class-conditional densities for a scenario with three classes in a two-dimensional feature space, where the features are denoted as \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). Each class has a Gaussian distribution, and they are represented by different colors: red, green, and blue. The contours indicate areas of equal probability density for the respective classes.

The red and blue classes are depicted as having the same covariance matrix, which is why their contours are similar in shape and orientation but differ in their center or mean. The green class appears to have a different covariance matrix, as its contours are oriented differently from those of the red and blue classes.

The decision boundaries between the classes are also indicated in this plot. These are the lines or curves that separate the different classes. In accordance with the text preceding the image, the decision boundary between the red and blue classes is linear because they share the same covariance matrix. In contrast, the decision boundaries between the red and green classes, as well as between the blue and green classes, are quadratic due to the different covariance matrices.

Overall, this image serves to visualize the concept of class distributions, posterior probabilities, and decision boundaries in the context of a multiclass classification problem using Gaussian distributions and discriminant functions.
