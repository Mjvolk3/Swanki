ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image displays a schematic representation of two probability distribution curves plotted against a single input variable, denoted by \( x \). The curves are labeled as \( p(x, \mathcal{C}_{1}) \) and \( p(x, \mathcal{C}_{2}) \), indicating the joint probability distributions for two classes, \(\mathcal{C}_{1}\) and \(\mathcal{C}_{2}\), based on the variable \( x \). There is a vertical line marking a decision boundary at a value of \( x \) denoted by \( \widehat{x} \). The decision boundary divides the space into two decision regions: \( \mathcal{R}_{1} \) to the left of \( \widehat{x} \) and \( \mathcal{R}_{2} \) to the right of \( \widehat{x} \).

The shaded regions under the curves represent areas where classification errors occur. For example, the green shaded area is the error due to instances from class \(\mathcal{C}_{2}\) incorrectly classified as \(\mathcal{C}_{1}\), and the blue shaded area is the error due to instances from class \(\mathcal{C}_{1}\) being misclassified as \(\mathcal{C}_{2}\). The optimal decision boundary is chosen to minimize these errors.

This illustration is typically used in the context of binary classification problems in statistics and machine learning, where the goal is to find the best decision boundary that separates the two classes with minimal classification error. The exact position of \( \widehat{x} \) is determined based on the distributions and by using the probabilistic criteria described in the contextual paper information provided.
