ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a graph showing two posterior probability curves for two different classes, labeled \( p(C_1|x) \) and \( p(C_2|x) \), as functions of a single continuous input variable \( x \). There are two vertical lines where the curves intersect the threshold \( \theta \), which is represented by a horizontal dashed line. Below the threshold \( \theta \), there is a region labeled as "reject region," indicating the range of values of \( x \) for which the classifier would choose not to make a decision because the highest posterior probability is not greater than the threshold \( \theta \). This introduces a mechanism to deal with uncertainty in classification, where rather than forcing a possibly incorrect classification, the decision is deferred for further analysis or additional information.
