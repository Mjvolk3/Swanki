ChatGPT figure/image summary: The first image (a) is a schematic illustration showing plots of joint probabilities \( p(x, \mathcal{C}_{1}) \) and \( p(x, \mathcal{C}_{2}) \) against an input variable \( x \). There are two decision regions, \( \mathcal{R}_{1} \) and \( \mathcal{R}_{2} \), with a decision boundary denoted as \( x = \widehat{x} \). The distribution for \( p(x, \mathcal{C}_{1}) \) is shown on the left, and the distribution for \( p(x, \mathcal{C}_{2}) \) is on the right.

In the regions where these distributions overlap, there's a potential for classification error. The red double-headed arrow indicates that by varying the location of the decision boundary, one can manage the classification errors differently. The red, green, and blue shaded areas represent regions where classification errors occur: red for the region where \( \mathcal{C}_{2} \) is incorrectly assigned to \( \mathcal{R}_{1} \), green for the overlap where either misclassification can occur, and blue where \( \mathcal{C}_{1} \) is incorrectly assigned to \( \mathcal{R}_{2} \).

This illustration supports the textual explanation of how to minimize the probability of making classification mistakes by assigning each point \( x \) to the class with the larger value of the probability density function at that point.

The second image (b) shows the same schematic after the decision boundary has been optimized. It appears at \( x = x_{0} \), where the two probability distributions cross. This point of intersection is where the decision boundary minimizes the misclassification errors (the red region disappears). The decision rule here would assign values of \( x \geqslant x_{0} \) to class \( \mathcal{C}_{2} \) (region \( \mathcal{R}_{2} \)) and values of \( x < x_{0} \) to class \( \mathcal{C}_{1} \) (region \( \mathcal{R}_{1} \)), corresponding to the highest posterior probability \( p(\mathcal{C}_{k} | x) \) for each \( x \).
