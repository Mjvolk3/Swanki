ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts two plots related to a binary classification problem in the context of probabilistic models for machine learning. 

On the left plot, we see the class-conditional densities \( p(x|\mathcal{C}_1) \) and \( p(x|\mathcal{C}_2) \) for two classes \( \mathcal{C}_1 \) and \( \mathcal{C}_2 \) with respect to a single input variable \( x \). The plot illustrates two probability density functions, one for each class. The density for \( \mathcal{C}_1 \) is shown in blue and has two modes, indicating two regions where samples from class \( \mathcal{C}_1 \) are more concentrated. The density for \( \mathcal{C}_2 \) is shown in red and has one mode, suggesting a single region of higher density for samples from class \( \mathcal{C}_2 \).

On the right plot, we see the corresponding posterior probabilities \( p(\mathcal{C}_1|x) \) and \( p(\mathcal{C}_2|x) \) as a function of \( x \). The blue curve represents the posterior probability for class \( \mathcal{C}_1 \) and the red curve for class \( \mathcal{C}_2 \). The green vertical line represents the decision boundary, which is the value of \( x \) that minimizes misclassification rate. According to the plot, if the value of \( x \) is to the left of the green line, the decision would favor class \( \mathcal{C}_1 \), while if it's to the right, the decision would favor class \( \mathcal{C}_2 \).

The decision boundary is chosen based on the assumption that the prior probabilities of both classes are equal. The figure is used to explain the concept of decision boundaries in the context of discriminative models and illustrates that certain features of the class-conditional densities may not affect the posterior probabilities and hence the decision boundary.
