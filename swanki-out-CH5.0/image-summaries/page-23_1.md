ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a split-screen graphical representation with two plots. On the left side, there's a 3D plot showcasing two overlapping Gaussian distributions in a two-dimensional input space (labeled \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \)). One Gaussian distribution is shaded in red and the other in blue. This plot represents the class-conditional densities for two classes, indicating how data points are distributed in each class.

The right side of the image features another 3D plot that depicts the posterior probability \( p(\mathcal{C}_{1} \mid \mathbf{x}) \) as a function of the two-dimensional input space. This is represented as a smooth surface transitioning from red to blue, indicating the probability of data points belonging to class \( \mathcal{C}_{1} \) (red) or class \( \mathcal{C}_{2} \) (blue). The surface is colored with shades of red and blue to reflect the mixture of posterior probabilities between the two classes, with areas of higher red intensity indicating higher probabilities for class \( \mathcal{C}_{1} \) and areas of higher blue intensity indicating higher probabilities for class \( \mathcal{C}_{2} \).

In summary, the left plot illustrates the class distributions, while the right plot visualizes the resulting decision boundary as influenced by these distributions, with the decision boundary presumably occurring where the colors blend into each other indicating a probability transition.
