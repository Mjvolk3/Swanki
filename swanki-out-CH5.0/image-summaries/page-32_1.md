ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts a schematic representation of a multi-class linear classification model as a neural network with a single layer of connections. It shows nodes that represent basis functions with the solid node representing the 'bias' basis function (φ₀). Each output (y₁ to yₖ) is also represented by a node. The links between nodes indicate corresponding weight and bias parameters. This is a visual representation of the mathematical concepts expressed in the text which relates to multi-class logistic regression in a machine learning context.
