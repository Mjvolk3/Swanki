ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts two plots that illustrate the role of nonlinear basis functions in a linear classification model, as described in the provided text. 

The left-hand plot represents the original input space, marked as x1 and x2 on the x-axis and y-axis respectively. In this space, data points are shown from two classes, labeled red and blue. Each class seems to be clustered around different centers, marked with green plus signs, which are the centers of two 'Gaussian' basis functions. The green circles represent the contours of these basis functions.

The right-hand plot represents the feature space obtained after applying the nonlinear basis functions, labeled as ϕ1 and ϕ2 on the x-axis and y-axis respectively. After the transformation, we can see that the data points now form distinct clusters that are separable by a straight line, which is shown as a black line in the plot. This black line is the linear decision boundary achieved through logistic regression, corresponding to a nonlinear decision boundary in the original input space. The nonlinear decision boundary is depicted in the left-hand plot by the black curve that separates the red and blue data points.

The image visualizes the concept that while the original input space may have non-linearly separable classes, transforming the input space using basis functions can lead to a feature space where the classes are linearly separable. Hence, it demonstrates how a logistic regression model can create a complex decision boundary in the original input space while maintaining a linear decision boundary in the transformed feature space.
