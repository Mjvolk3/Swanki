ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image depicts two curves on a Cartesian coordinate system. On the horizontal axis, we have the values ranging approximately from -7 to 7, and on the vertical axis, the values range from 0 to 1. The solid red curve represents the logistic sigmoid function, σ(a), which is an S-shaped curve that rises from near 0 on the left to approach 1 on the right. The dashed blue curve, which closely follows the red curve, represents a scaled probit function, Φ(λa), with the scaling factor λ² = π/8, where λ² is chosen such that the derivatives of both curves are equal at a = 0.

This sigmoid function transforms its input into a value between 0 and 1, which is useful for representing probabilities in classification algorithms. It shows how the input value, a, affects the output of the function, starting at very low values when a is negative and large in magnitude, and approaching 1 as a becomes positive and large. This function is often used in binary classification to delineate the probability of the input belonging to a particular class.
