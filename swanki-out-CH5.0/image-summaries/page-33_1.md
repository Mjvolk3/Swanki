ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image displays two curves along with a vertical line and a shaded area beneath one of the curves. The blue curve represents a probability density function (PDF), which appears to be a mixture of two Gaussian distributions. The red curve is a cumulative distribution function (CDF), and its value at any point on the x-axis corresponds to the area under the blue curve up to that point. The vertical green line marks a specific value on the x-axis, and the area to the left of this line under the blue curve (shaded in green) represents the value of the red curve at the point where the green line intersects the red curve. The illustration demonstrates the relationship between the PDF and the CDF in the context of threshold-based probabilistic classification models discussed in the provided text.
