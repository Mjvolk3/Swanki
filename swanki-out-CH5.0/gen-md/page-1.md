## In classification problems, what is the goal in terms of input vectors and classes?

The goal in classification is to take an input vector $\mathrm{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$ and assign it to one of $K$ discrete classes $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ where $k=1, \ldots, K$.

## What is the nature of the classes $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ in classification problems?

In the most common scenario, the classes $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ are taken to be disjoint, so that each input is assigned to one and only one class.

## Describe what happens to the input space in classification problems with respect to decision regions.

The input space $\mathbb{R}^{D}$ is divided into decision regions whose boundaries are called decision boundaries or decision surfaces.

## Using classification models that are equivalent to single-layer neural networks, what is the primary concept introduced before dealing with more complex deep neural networks?

These single-layer neural network classification models allow the introduction of the key concepts of classification before dealing with more general deep neural networks.

## How are output variables in regression models similar to the class of models discussed for classification in this text?

In both, output variables or classes are linear functions of the model parameters and can be expressed as single-layer neural networks.

## What is a crucial difference between regression models and classification models as discussed in this context?

While regression models output continuous values, classification models assign inputs to one of the discrete classes $\mathcal{C}_{k}$.
