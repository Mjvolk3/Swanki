## Explain the logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$.

The logistic sigmoid function is defined as:

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)}
$$

This function maps the entire real axis to a finite interval between 0 and 1. It is often used in classification algorithms and satisfies the symmetry property $\sigma(-a) = 1 - \sigma(a)$.

## What symmetry property does the logistic sigmoid function satisfy?

The logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ satisfies the symmetry property:

$$
\sigma(-a) = 1 - \sigma(a)
$$

This property is easily verified by substituting $-a$ for $a$ in the logistic sigmoid function:

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)}
$$

and

$$
\sigma(-a) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(a)} = 1 - \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)} = 1 - \sigma(a)
$$

## Derive the inverse of the logistic sigmoid function.

The inverse of the logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ can be derived as follows. Starting from the definition:

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)}
$$

We set $\sigma$ equal to $\frac{1}{1+\exp(-a)}$ and solve for $a$:

$$
\sigma = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)} \implies 1 + \exp(-a) = \frac{1}{\sigma}
$$

$$
\exp(-a) = \frac{1}{\sigma} - 1 = \frac{1 - \sigma}{\sigma}
$$

Taking the log of both sides:

$$
-a = \ln\left(\frac{1 - \sigma}{\sigma}\right) \implies a = \ln\left(\frac{\sigma}{1 - \sigma}\right)
$$

## How can $p(\mathcal{C}_1 | \mathbf{x})$ be expressed using $\sigma(a)$?

The posterior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_1 | \mathbf{x})$ can be expressed using the logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ as follows:

$$
p(\mathcal{C}_1 | \mathbf{x}) = \frac{p(\mathbf{x} | \mathcal{C}_1) p(\mathcal{C}_1)}{p(\mathbf{x} | \mathcal{C}_1) p(\mathcal{C}_1) + p(\mathbf{x} | \mathcal{C}_2) p(\mathcal{C}_2)} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)} = \sigma(a)
$$

where $a$ is defined as:

$$
a = \ln \frac{p(\mathbf{x} | \mathcal{C}_1) p(\mathcal{C}_1)}{p(\mathbf{x} | \mathcal{C}_2) p(\mathcal{C}_2)}
$$

## What is the scaled probit function and why is it used alongside the logistic sigmoid function?

The scaled probit function $\Phi(\lambda a)$ is defined such that its derivatives are equal to those of the logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(a)$ at $a = 0$. For $\lambda^2 = \pi/8$, the scaling factor $\pi/8$ is chosen to match these derivatives. This creates a useful comparison between the probit and logistic sigmoid functions for classification purposes.

## What is the significance of the logit function in relation to the logistic sigmoid?

The logit function is the inverse of the logistic sigmoid function and is defined as:

$$
a = \ln\left(\frac{\sigma}{1 - \sigma}\right)
$$

It represents the log of the ratio of probabilities, also known as the log odds, for two classes:

$$
\ln \left[ p(\mathcal{C}_1 | \mathbf{x}) / p(\mathcal{C}_2 | \mathbf{x}) \right]
$$

This logit function is crucial for understanding the relationship between the logistic sigmoid and posterior probabilities.
