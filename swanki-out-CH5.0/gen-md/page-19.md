## What is the ROC curve, and what does its diagonal line represent in the context of a classifier?

The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve plots the true positive rate ($y$-axis) versus the false positive rate ($x$-axis). The diagonal line in the ROC curve represents the performance of a random classifier, which assigns each data point to the cancer class with probability $\rho$ and to the normal class with probability $1-\rho$. This baseline ROC curve is a straight line from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$.

## Explain the significance of a classifier's position on the ROC curve. Where does the best possible classifier lie?

A classifier's position on the ROC curve indicates its performance. The best possible classifier would be represented by a point at the top left corner of the ROC diagram, which corresponds to a true positive rate of 1 and a false positive rate of 0.

$$
\text{Best classifier:} \; (0, 1)
$$

## What does the area under the ROC curve (AUC) represent, and what is its significance?

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) represents the overall performance of a classifier. An AUC value of 0.5 corresponds to random guessing, whereas an AUC value of 1.0 corresponds to a perfect classifier.

$$
\text{AUC} = \int_0^1 TPR(FPR) \, d(FPR)
$$

where $TPR$ is the true positive rate and $FPR$ is the false positive rate.

## Define the $F$-score and explain what it measures in the context of classification problems.

The $F$-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that balances both precision and recall.

$$
F_\beta = \left(1 + \beta^2\right) \cdot \frac{{\text{precision} \cdot \text{recall}}}{{\left(\beta^2 \cdot \text{precision}\right) + \text{recall}}}
$$

Typically, $\beta=1$ is used, which is called the $F_1$ score.

$$
F_1 = \frac{2 \cdot \text{precision} \cdot \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}}
$$

## In ROC analysis, explain the significance of the top right corner and bottom left corner for classifiers.

The top right corner of the ROC curve represents a classifier that assigns every data point to the cancer class, resulting in all true positives and false positives. Conversely, the bottom left corner represents a classifier that assigns every data point to the normal class, resulting in no false or true positives.

## What happens to the ROC curve when two classifier curves cross each other, and how should we interpret it?

When two ROC curves cross each other, the choice of the better classifier depends on the operating point. This implies that at different thresholds, one classifier may perform better than the other. The best classifier should be chosen based on the specific false positive rate or true positive rate important for the application.
