## Define the variable $\mathbf{S}$ using the given context.

We define $\mathbf{S}$ as a weighted average of the covariance matrices $\mathbf{S}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{S}_{2}$:

$$
\mathbf{S} = \frac{N_{1}}{N} \mathbf{S}_{1} + \frac{N_{2}}{N} \mathbf{S}_{2}
$$

where $N$ is the total number of samples, $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ are the number of samples in Class 1 and Class 2, respectively.

## What is $\mathbf{S}_{1}$ and how is it computed?

$\mathbf{S}_{1}$ is the covariance matrix associated with Class 1, calculated as:

$$
\mathbf{S}_{1} = \frac{1}{N_{1}} \sum_{n \in \mathcal{C}_{1}}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}\right)\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

where $N_{1}$ is the number of samples in Class 1, $\mathbf{x}_{n}$ are the data points, and $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}$ is the mean vector for Class 1.

## What assumption is made in the naive Bayes model for discrete feature values?

In the naive Bayes model for discrete feature values, we assume that the feature values $x_{i}$ are independent and conditioned on the class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$. This leads to the class-conditional distribution:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) = \prod_{i=1}^{D} \mu_{k i}^{x_{i}}\left(1-\mu_{k i}\right)^{1-x_{i}}
$$

where $D$ is the number of features.

## Extend the weighted average of covariance matrices $\mathbf{S}$ to the general $K$-class problem for maximum likelihood estimation.

In the $K$-class problem, the weighted average of the covariance matrices is similarly computed by extending the definition of $\mathbf{S}$:

$$
\mathbf{S} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{N_{k}}{N} \mathbf{S}_{k}
$$

where $N_{k}$ is the number of samples in Class $k$, and $\mathbf{S}_{k}$ is the covariance matrix for Class $k$. This yields a shared covariance matrix for Gaussian distributions across multiple classes.

## Derive the linear function $a_{k}(\mathbf{x})$ in the context of the naive Bayes assumption for discrete feature values.

Starting with the class-conditional distribution:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) = \prod_{i=1}^{D} \mu_{k i}^{x_{i}}\left(1-\mu_{k i}\right)^{1-x_{i}}
$$

Substituting into equation (5.46) yields:

$$
a_{k}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{D}\left\{x_{i} \ln \mu_{k i} + \left(1-x_{i}\right) \ln \left(1 - \mu_{k i}\right)\right\} + \ln p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)
$$

This formulation shows that $a_{k}(\mathbf{x})$ are linear functions of the input values $x_{i}$.

## For binary discrete feature values $x_{i} \in \{0,1\}$, explain why the general distribution grows exponentially with the number of features.

For $D$ binary inputs, a general distribution requires a table of $2^{D}$ values for each class, leading to $2^{D} - 1$ independent variables because of the summation constraint. This exponential growth with the number of features necessitates a more restricted representation, such as the naive Bayes assumption.
