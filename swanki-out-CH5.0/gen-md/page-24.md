## Explain the expression that denotes the joint probability for class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ given a data point $\mathbf{x}_{n}$ and its parameters.

For class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ when $t_{n} = 1$, the joint probability $p(\mathbf{x}_{n}, \mathcal{C}_{1})$ is given by:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}, \mathcal{C}_{1}\right) = p\left(\mathcal{C}_{1}\right) p\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \mathcal{C}_{1}\right)
$$

Given that $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{1}\right) = \pi$ and $\mathbf{x}_{n}$ follows a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)$, we have:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}, \mathcal{C}_{1}\right) = \pi \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)
$$

## Describe the likelihood function for a data set with Gaussian class-conditional densities and shared covariance matrix.

The likelihood function for a data set $\left\{\mathbf{x}_{n}, t_{n}\right\}$ with Gaussian class-conditional densities and shared covariance matrix is:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{X} \mid \pi, \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right) = \prod_{n=1}^{N}\left[\pi \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)\right]^{t_{n}}\left[(1-\pi) \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)\right]^{1-t_{n}}
$$

where $\mathbf{t} = \left(t_{1}, \ldots, t_{N}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}$.

Here, $t_{n}$ indicates the class label of the data point $\mathbf{x}_{n}$.

## In the context of maximizing the likelihood function, what is the implication of taking the logarithm of the likelihood function?

Taking the logarithm of the likelihood function simplifies the product of probabilities into a sum of logarithms, which is more convenient for maximization. The likelihood function in this context is:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{X} \mid \pi, \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right) = \prod_{n=1}^{N}\left[\pi \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)\right]^{t_{n}}\left[(1-\pi) \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)\right]^{1-t_{n}}
$$

Maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood but often simplifies the computation.

## How is the boundary between classes $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ with the same covariance matrix described?

The boundary between classes $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ having the same covariance matrix is linear. This is due to the fact that the discriminant function for Gaussian distributions with shared covariance reduces to a linear function.

## Given two classes with different covariance matrices, what shape do the decision boundaries typically take?

For two classes with different covariance matrices, the decision boundaries are typically quadratic. This non-linear nature arises from the different shapes and spreads of the Gaussian distributions.

## Define the prior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_{1})$ and $p(\mathcal{C}_{2})$ in the context of Gaussian class-conditional densities.

The prior probabilities for classes $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ are defined as:

$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{1}\right) = \pi \quad \text{and} \quad p\left(\mathcal{C}_{2}\right) = 1 - \pi
$$

These priors indicate the initial belief about the proportion of each class before observing any data.
