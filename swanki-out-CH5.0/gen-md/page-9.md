## Explain the goal of decision theory in the context of classifying the presence or absence of cancer.

% 

The goal of decision theory in this context is to make optimal decisions about whether to give treatment to a patient based on the probabilistic analysis of an observed variable (the skin image). Given the image $\mathbf{x}$, we aim to decide whether it belongs to class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ (absence of cancer) or class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ (presence of cancer). The optimal decision rule is derived based on the probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x})$, where $\mathbf{C}_{k}$ represents the class.

### Card 2

## How can Bayes' theorem be used to determine the posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$?

$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)=\frac{p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)}{p(\mathbf{x})}
$$

% 

Bayes' theorem allows us to express the posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$ as:

$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)=\frac{p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)}{p(\mathbf{x})}
$$

Here:
- $p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}\right)$ is the likelihood of the image given class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$.
- $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right)$ is the prior probability of class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$.
- $p(\mathbf{x})$ is the marginal likelihood of observing the image $\mathbf{x}$, which can be calculated as $p(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{k} p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}) p(\mathcal{C}_{k})$.

This theorem updates our prior beliefs with new evidence $\mathbf{x}$ to produce the posterior probability.

### Card 3

## Describe the misclassification rate and its importance in decision theory. 

%

The misclassification rate is the proportion of instances where the classification rule assigns the wrong class to an input. It is a critical criterion for evaluating the performance of a decision rule. Minimizing the misclassification rate means that fewer errors are made, which is essential in applications such as diagnosing cancer, where incorrect classification could have significant consequences.

### Card 4

## What are decision regions and decision boundaries in the context of classification?

%

Decision regions are areas in the input space where, based on the classification rule, all input points are assigned to the same class. The boundaries between these decision regions are known as decision boundaries or decision surfaces. These boundaries determine the points at which the classification rule changes from one class to another.

### Card 5

## In the context of cancer classification, explain the relationship between prior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_{k})$ and posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$.

%

The prior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_{k})$ represents the initial belief about the likelihood of class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ before considering any new evidence (such as a patient's skin image $\mathbf{x}$). The posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$, on the other hand, is the updated probability of class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ after taking the new evidence into account using Bayes' theorem. It essentially revises the prior probability in light of the observed data $\mathbf{x}$.

### Card 6

## What criterion should be used if the goal is to minimize the misclassification rate in the decision-making process?

%

If the goal is to minimize the misclassification rate, the criterion used should be to assign each input $\mathbf{x}$ to the class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ with the highest posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$. This approach ensures that each input is classified in the way that is most likely to be correct, given the observed data.
