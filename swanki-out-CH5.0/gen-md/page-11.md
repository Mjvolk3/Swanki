## What are the joint probabilities $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{k})$ used for in the context of decision boundary illustration?

The joint probabilities $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{k})$ for each class are plotted against $x$ to determine the optimal decision boundary denoted by $\widehat{x}$. The goal is to minimize the misclassification rate by varying $\widehat{x}$ such that the posterior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid x)$ are maximized for each class.

## Describe the error contributions in regions $x<\widehat{x}$ and $x\geqslant \widehat{x}$ for the decision boundary $\widehat{x}$.

For $x<\widehat{x}$, the errors arise from points belonging to class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ being misclassified as $\mathcal{C}_{1}$, which is represented by the sum of the red and green regions. Conversely, for $x\geqslant \widehat{x}$, the errors arise from points belonging to class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ being misclassified as $\mathcal{C}_{2}$, represented by the blue region.

## How does the combined area of the blue and green regions behave with varying $\widehat{x}$?

As $\widehat{x}$ varies (indicated by the red double-headed arrow), the combined area of the blue and green regions remains constant, while the size of the red region varies. This reflects the trade-off between different types of misclassifications.

## What is the significance of the decision boundary $\widehat{x}=x_{0}$?

The decision boundary $\widehat{x}=x_{0}$ is significant as it is the point where the curves for $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{1})$ and $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{2})$ cross, eliminating the red region and thus achieving the minimum misclassification rate. This boundary ensures that each value of $x$ is assigned to the class with the higher posterior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid x)$.

## What decision rule minimizes the misclassification rate?

The minimum misclassification rate decision rule assigns each value of $x$ to the class with the higher posterior probability $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid x)$. This optimal choice for boundary, $\widehat{x}$, occurs where the joint probabilities $p\left(x, \mathcal{C}_{1}\right)$ and $p\left(x, \mathcal{C}_{2}\right)$ intersect.

## What happens to the red region at the optimal decision boundary $\widehat{x}=x_{0}$?

At the optimal decision boundary $\widehat{x}=x_{0}$, where the curves for $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{1})$ and $p(x, \mathcal{C}_{2})$ intersect, the red region, which represents the misclassification of class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ as $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ for $x<\widehat{x}$, disappears, thereby reducing the misclassification rate to its minimum.
