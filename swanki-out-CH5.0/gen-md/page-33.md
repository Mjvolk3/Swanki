## Explain the relationship between the probability density function $p(\theta)$ and the cumulative distribution function $f(a)$ as described in the paper.

The probability density function $p(\theta)$, represented by the blue curve, and the cumulative distribution function $f(a)$, represented by the red curve, have a specific relationship:

- The value of $p(\theta)$ at any point corresponds to the slope of $f(a)$ at the same point.
- Conversely, the value of $f(a)$ at a given point is the area under $p(\theta)$ up to that point.

$$
f(a) = \int_{-\infty}^{a} p(\theta) \, d\theta
$$

## Define the activation function $f(a)$ in terms of the cumulative distribution function and explain its role in the stochastic threshold model.

The activation function $f(a)$ is given by the cumulative distribution function of the probability density $p(\theta)$:

$$
f(a) = \int_{-\infty}^{a} p(\theta) \, d\theta
$$

In the stochastic threshold model, the class label $t$ takes the value 1 if $a = \mathbf{w}^\mathrm{T} \phi$ exceeds a threshold $\theta$, and 0 otherwise. This makes $f(a)$ the activation function that translates the linear combination of the feature variables into a probability.

## What does the expression $a = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}$ represent in the context of generalized linear models?

In generalized linear models, the expression $a = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}$ represents a linear combination of the feature variables $\boldsymbol{\phi}$, with $\mathbf{w}$ being the weight vector. This combination $a$ is then used as the argument for the activation function $f(a)$ to determine the class probabilities.

\[
a = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\phi}
\]

## Derive the cumulative distribution function $\Phi(a)$ for a zero-mean, unit-variance Gaussian distribution.

For a zero-mean, unit-variance Gaussian distribution, the cumulative distribution function $\Phi(a)$ is given by:

$$
\Phi(a) = \int_{-\infty}^{a} \mathcal{N}(\theta \mid 0,1) \, d\theta
$$

where $\mathcal{N}(\theta \mid 0, 1)$ denotes the Gaussian probability density function with mean 0 and variance 1.

## What is the role of the threshold $\theta$ in the noisy threshold model, and how is it related to the density $p(\theta)$?

In the noisy threshold model:

$$
\begin{cases}t_{n}=1, & \text{if } a_{n} \geqslant \theta \\ t_{n}=0, & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}
$$

The threshold $\theta$ is drawn from a probability density $p(\theta)$. This randomness in $\theta$ introduces noise into the model, which affects the activation function $f(a)$. The resulting activation function is the cumulative distribution function of $p(\theta)$.

$$
f(a) = \int_{-\infty}^{a} p(\theta) \, \mathrm{d} \theta
$$

## Compare the activation function used in logistic regression to the one used in the noisy threshold model as discussed in the paper.

In logistic regression, the activation function is the logistic (sigmoid) function:

$$
f(a) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-a}}
$$

In the noisy threshold model, the activation function is the cumulative distribution function $f(a)$ derived from the probability density $p(\theta)$. For a zero-mean, unit-variance Gaussian, this is the Gaussian cumulative distribution function $\Phi(a)$:

$$
\Phi(a) = \int_{-\infty}^{a} \mathcal{N}(\theta \mid 0,1) \, d\theta
$$
