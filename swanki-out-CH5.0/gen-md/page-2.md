## Define linear classification models and the concept of linearly separable data sets.

Linear classification models are models where the decision surfaces are linear functions of the input vector $\mathbf{x}$ and, hence, are defined by $(D-1)$-dimensional hyperplanes within the $D$-dimensional input space. Data sets whose classes can be separated exactly by linear decision surfaces are said to be linearly separable.

## Explain the three distinct approaches to solving classification problems as mentioned in the paper.

The three distinct approaches to solving classification problems are:
1. Constructing a discriminant function that directly assigns each vector $\mathbf{x}$ to a specific class.
2. Modeling the conditional probability distributions $p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x})$ in an inference stage and subsequently using these distributions to make optimal decisions. This can be further divided into:
   - Discriminative probabilistic models
   - Generative probabilistic models

## Given Bayes' theorem for generative probabilistic models, derive how the posterior probabilities are computed.

In generative probabilistic models, we model the class-conditional densities $p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k})$ and the prior probabilities $p(\mathcal{C}_{k})$ for the classes, then compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

$$
p(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}) = \frac{p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{k}) p(\mathcal{C}_{k})}{p(\mathbf{x})}
$$

Here $p(\mathbf{x})$ is the evidence, which can be computed as:

$$
p(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{j} p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{C}_{j}) p(\mathcal{C}_{j})
$$

## What is a discriminant function in the context of classification problems, and how is it related to the input vector $\mathbf{x}$?

A discriminant function is a function that takes an input vector $\mathbf{x}$ and assigns it to one of $K$ classes, denoted $\mathcal{C}_{k}$. In linear discriminants, the decision surfaces are hyperplanes.

## Derive the simplest representation of a linear discriminant function for two classes, and explain the decision boundary.

The simplest representation of a linear discriminant function for two classes is:

$$
y(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + w_{0}
$$

where $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector and $w_{0}$ is a bias. An input vector $\mathbf{x}$ is assigned to class $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ if $y(\mathbf{x}) \geq 0$ and to class $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ otherwise. The decision boundary is defined by $y(\mathbf{x}) = 0$, which corresponds to a $(D-1)$-dimensional hyperplane.

## Explain the significance of the terms $\mathbf{w}$ and $w_{0}$ in the linear discriminant function for two classes.

In the linear discriminant function 

$$y(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x} + w_{0},$$ 

$\mathbf{w}$ represents the weight vector, which determines the orientation of the decision boundary, and $w_{0}$ is the bias term, which shifts the decision boundary. It's important to note that $w_{0}$ is not the statistical bias.
