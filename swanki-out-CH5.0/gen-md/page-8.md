### Card 1:
## What are the key stages of the machine learning process in the context of classifiers?

## The machine learning process in the context of classifiers can be broken down into two stages:
- Inference: Determining the joint probability distribution $p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t})$ from a set of training data. This provides a complete summary of the uncertainty associated with the variables.
- Decision: Making a specific prediction for the value of $t$ or taking a specific action based on the understanding of the values $t$ is likely to take.

### Card 2:
## Describe the differences between regression problems and classification problems in terms of the target variable $\mathbf{t}$.

## In regression problems, the target variable $\mathbf{t}$:
- Comprises continuous variables
- Is often a vector if we aim to predict several related quantities

In classification problems, the target variable $\mathbf{t}$:
- Represents class labels 
- Is generally a vector if there are more than two classes

### Card 3:
## What does the joint probability distribution $p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t})$ represent, and why is it important?

## The joint probability distribution $p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t})$ provides a complete summary of the uncertainty associated with the input vector $\mathbf{x}$ and the target vector $\mathbf{t}$. 

It is important because determining $p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t})$ from a set of training data is a critical part of the inference stage in machine learning. This understanding helps in making accurate predictions or decisions based on the data.

### Card 4:
## How do least squares and logistic regression models differ in their sensitivity to outliers?

% Figure 5.4 illustrates the discussed scenario, but consider the textual explanation.

## Least squares regression is highly sensitive to outliers, as they can significantly affect the decision boundaries. In contrast, logistic regression is more robust and less sensitive to outliers. This is evident when extra data points are added at the bottom right of the diagram, affecting the least squares boundary but not the logistic regression boundary.

### Card 5:
## In a practical application involving decision theory, what is often required, and what does this aspect emphasize?

## In practical applications of decision theory, it is often required to:
- Make a specific prediction for the value of $t$.
- Take a specific action based on the values $t$ is likely to take.

This aspect emphasizes making informed decisions based on the inference drawn from data, such as using the probability distribution $p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t})$.

### Card 6:
## Using the example of medical diagnosis, explain the inputs and focus of decision theory.

% Consider the example of determining cancer from an image of a skin lesion.

## In the context of medical diagnosis:
- The input vector $\mathbf{x}$ consists of the set of pixel intensities from the image of a skin lesion.
- The focus of decision theory is to predict whether the patient has cancer (classification problem) and take action based on this prediction (such as further medical tests or treatments).
