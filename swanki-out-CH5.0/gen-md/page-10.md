## What is the probability of a mistake occurring when classifying $\mathbf{x}$ into classes $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$?

The probability of a mistake is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p(\text{mistake}) & = p\left(\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{R}_{1}, \mathcal{C}_{2}\right) + p\left(\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{R}_{2}, \mathcal{C}_{1}\right) \\
& = \int_{\mathcal{R}_{1}} p\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{C}_{2}\right) \, d\mathbf{x} + \int_{\mathcal{R}_{2}} p\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{C}_{1}\right) \, d\mathbf{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

This equation represents the sum of the probabilities of $\mathbf{x}$ being in region $\mathcal{R}_{1}$ but actually belonging to $\mathcal{C}_{2}$, and $\mathbf{x}$ being in region $\mathcal{R}_{2}$ but actually belonging to $\mathcal{C}_{1}$.

## How can we minimize the probability of making a mistake in classification between two classes?

We should assign $\mathbf{x}$ to the class where the posterior probability is larger. Specifically, for $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{2}$:

$$
\text{Assign } \mathbf{x} \text{ to } \mathcal{C}_{1} \text{ if } p\left(\mathcal{C}_{1} \mid \mathbf{x}\right) > p\left(\mathcal{C}_{2} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)
$$

Using the product rule of probability:

$$
p\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) = p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right) p(\mathbf{x})
$$

Because $p(\mathbf{x})$ is common to both terms, the minimum probability of making a mistake is obtained if each $\mathbf{x}$ is assigned to the class for which $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$ is largest.

## What is the method to maximize the probability of being correct in classification for $K$ classes?

The probability of being correct is given by:

$$
p(\text{correct}) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} p\left(\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{R}_{k}, \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \int_{\mathcal{R}_{k}} p\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) \, d\mathbf{x}
$$

This is maximized when each $\mathbf{x}$ is assigned to the class having the largest posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$.

## What is a loss function in the context of decision theory, and why is it important?

A loss function, also called a cost function, is a measure of the loss incurred in making a decision. It allows us to formalize and quantify different consequences of decisions, helping us to minimize the total loss incurred. It is particularly important in applications where different types of mistakes have different consequences, such as in medical diagnosis.

For instance, misclassifying a healthy patient as having cancer poses less risk than misclassifying a cancer patient as healthy.

## Why might minimizing the number of misclassifications not always be the best objective?

Minimizing the number of misclassifications does not account for the different consequences of different types of mistakes. For example, in medical diagnosis, diagnosing a patient with cancer as healthy has far more severe consequences than diagnosing a healthy patient as having cancer. Therefore, we need to consider a loss function that takes these different impacts into account.

## How can we use the posterior probability in classification to devise an optimal decision rule?

Using the product rule $p\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{C}_{k}\right) = p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right) p(\mathbf{x})$ and noting that $p(\mathbf{x})$ is common to all terms, the decision rule is:

Assign $\mathbf{x}$ to the class $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ for which the posterior probability $p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)$ is largest.

This minimizes the probability of making a mistake and maximizes the probability of being correct.
