## Derive the expression for the modified Bessel function of the first kind, \( I_0(m) \), used in defining the von Mises distribution normalization coefficient.

The zeroth-order modified Bessel function of the first kind, \( I_0(m) \), is crucial for the normalization of the von Mises distribution. It is defined as:

$$
I_{0}(m)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \exp \{m \cos \theta\} \mathrm{d} \theta

## Describe the role of the concentration parameter \( m \) in the von Mises distribution.

In the von Mises distribution, \( m \) serves as the concentration parameter, which functions analogously to the precision (the inverse of variance) of the Gaussian distribution. A higher value of \( m \) indicates a higher concentration of the distribution around the mean \( \theta_0 \), leading to a narrower spread. For large \( m \), the von Mises distribution approximates a Gaussian distribution.

## Explain how to derive the maximum likelihood estimator for \( \theta_0 \) in the von Mises distribution.

To derive the MLE for \( \theta_0 \) in the von Mises distribution, we start from the log-likelihood function:

$$
\ln p\left(\mathcal{D} \mid \theta_{0}, m\right)=-N \ln (2 \pi)-N \ln I_{0}(m)+m \sum_{n=1}^{N} \cos \left(\theta_{n}-\theta_{0}\right)
$$

Setting the derivative of the log likelihood with respect to \( \theta_0 \) to zero gives:

$$
\frac{d}{d\theta_0}\ln p\left(\mathcal{D} \mid \theta_{0}, m\right) = 0 \implies \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sin \left(\theta_{n}-\theta_{0}\right)=0
$$

Utilizing the trigonometric identity \( \sin(A-B) = \cos B \sin A - \cos A \sin B \), we can solve for \( \theta_0 \).

## Discuss the impact of large \( m \) values on the shape of the von Mises distribution.

As the concentration parameter \( m \) in the von Mises distribution increases, the distribution becomes increasingly peaked and narrow, focusing more tightly around the mean \( \theta_0 \). When \( m \) is large enough, the von Mises distribution approximates a Gaussian distribution, showcasing its flexibility in modeling circular data with varying degrees of concentration.

## What is the significance of the normalization coefficient in the von Mises distribution, expressed in terms of \( I_0(m) \)?

The normalization coefficient \( I_0(m) \) ensures that the von Mises distribution integrates to one over its domain, which is essential for it to be a valid probability distribution. This coefficient, involving the zeroth-order modified Bessel function, adjusts the distribution's shape based on the concentration parameter \( m \), maintaining proper normalization across different values of \( m \).
