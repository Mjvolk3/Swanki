## How does the parameter $K$ in $K$-nearest neighbour density estimation influence the resulting density model?
The parameter $K$ in $K$-nearest neighbour density estimation directly governs the degree of smoothing in the resulting density model. A smaller $K$ leads to a noisier density model with more fluctuations, capturing finer details of the data distribution. In contrast, a larger $K$ results in more smoothing, which can potentially obscure important features like multimodality in the underlying distribution.

## What are the challenges associated with a fixed kernel width $h$ in kernel-based density estimation?
Using a fixed kernel width $h$ in kernel-based density estimation can lead to suboptimal density estimates across different regions of the data space. If $h$ is large, it can cause over-smoothing in areas of high data density, obscuring significant structural details. Conversely, a small $h$ might lead to noisy estimates in less dense areas, potentially misrepresenting the underlying data distribution.

## In $K$-nearest neighbours density estimation, how is the volume $V$ determined?
In the $K$-nearest neighbours approach to density estimation, the volume $V$ of the sphere used to estimate the density at a point $\mathbf{x}$ is determined by the requirement to encompass exactly $K$ data points within it. The radius of this sphere expands until it contains $K$ points, and the volume $V$ is then computed from the resulting radius.
$$
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3,
$$
where $r$ is the radius of the sphere that contains $K$ points centered on $\mathbf{x}$.

## How is $K$-nearest neighbour density estimation adapted for classification tasks?
$K$-nearest neighbour density estimation can be adapted for classification by applying the density estimation process to each class separately, and then utilizing Bayes' theorem to classify new points. Specifically, for a new point $\mathbf{x}$, a sphere is drawn around it that includes exactly $K$ data points from all classes. The density estimates are then computed per class, and Bayes' theorem is applied to classify $\mathbf{x}$ into one of the classes based on these density estimates.

## Explain how the integrity of density estimation in sparse data regions can be maintained in $K$-nearest neighbour methods.
Maintaining the integrity of density estimation in sparse data regions using $K$-nearest neighbour methods involves adjusting the volume $V$ dynamically as the sphere expands to include $K$ data points. This dynamic adjustment helps to avoid over-smoothing in dense regions while still providing meaningful density estimates in sparser areas. By allowing $V$ to vary based on local data density, $K$-nearest neighbour methods can adaptively balance between detail preservation and noise reduction across different data regions.
