## Define the Schur complement in the context of matrix inversion and explain how it's used to compute $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{aa}$.

The Schur complement is a concept from linear algebra that simplifies the inversion of a block matrix. Given a block matrix 

$$
\mathbf{M} = \left(\begin{array}{ll}
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{aa} & \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{ab} \\
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{ba} & \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{bb}
\end{array}\right),
$$

the Schur complement of $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{bb}$ in $\mathbf{M}$ is defined by the formula:

$$
\mathbf{M}/\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{bb} = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{aa} - \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{ab} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{bb}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{ba}.
$$

This formula is crucial for computing $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{aa}$ in the inverted matrix $\mathbf{M}^{-1}$, where $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{aa}$ is given by

$$
\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{aa} = \left(\mathbf{M}/\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{bb}\right)^{-1}.
$$

This approach is particularly useful in the context of multivariate Gaussian distributions, where such block matrix inversions frequently arise.

## How does the covariance of the conditional distribution, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{a \mid b}$, get calculated using the partitioned covariance matrix?

The covariance of the conditional distribution $p(\mathbf{x}_a \mid \mathbf{x}_b)$ is calculated using the formula for the Schur complement within a partitioned covariance matrix. Given that 

$$
\mathbf{\Sigma} = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{aa} & \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{ab} \\
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{ba} & \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{bb}
\end{array}\right),
$$

the covariance $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{a \mid b}$ of the conditional distribution is computed as

$$
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{a \mid b} = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{aa} - \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{ab} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{bb}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{ba}.
$$

This expression reflects the variance of $\mathbf{x}_a$ that is not explained by $\mathbf{x}_b$, effectively isolating the influence of $\mathbf{x}_b$ on $\mathbf{x}_a$.

## Analyze the linear relationship indicated by the conditional mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{a \mid b}$ in the context of a linear-Gaussian model.

In the framework of linear-Gaussian models, the conditional mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{a \mid b}$ is given by

$$
\boldsymbol{\mu}_{a \mid b} = \boldsymbol{\mu}_a + \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{ab} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{bb}^{-1}(\mathbf{x}_b - \boldsymbol{\mu}_b).
$$

This formula depicts a linear relationship between $\mathbf{x}_b$ and the expected value of $\mathbf{x}_a$, conditioned on $\mathbf{x}_b$. The term $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{ab} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{bb}^{-1}$ acts as a linear transformation, specifying how changes in $\mathbf{x}_b$ affect $\mathbf{x}_a$. This linearity is a hallmark of the linear-Gaussian model, which is indicative of Gaussian distributions' closure under conditioning and marginalization.

## Extending the concept of Gaussian marginalization, explain how the covariance of the marginal distribution $p(\mathbf{x}_a)$ is derived from the joint distribution parameters.

In Gaussian distributions, any marginal distribution derived from a joint Gaussian distribution is also Gaussian. For the marginal distribution $p(\mathbf{x}_a)$, when $\mathbf{x}_a$ and $\mathbf{x}_b$ jointly follow a Gaussian distribution, the marginal covariance is derived from the larger covariance matrix of the joint distribution by only focusing on the a-partition:

$$
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{a}^{\text{marginal}} = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{aa}.
$$

This extraction is straightforward because, in the joint Gaussian framework, the covariance of $\mathbf{x}_a$ independent of $\mathbf{x}_b$ directly reflects the variance contained in the $\mathbf{x}_a$ components. This principle significantly simplifies the study of multivariate statistics by maintaining distributional properties during marginalization.

## Discuss the process and significance of completing the square in the context of integrating out $\mathbf{x}_b$ from the joint Gaussian density function.

Completing the square is a vital algebraic technique used in the analysis of Gaussian distributions, especially when integrating out variables. The purpose is to transform the quadratic expression in $\mathbf{x}_b$ into a perfect square form to facilitate integration. In this instance, focusing on the terms that involve $\mathbf{x}_b$, we have:

$$
-\frac{1}{2} \mathbf{x}_b^T \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{bb} \mathbf{x}_b + \mathbf{x}_b^T \mathbf{m} = -\frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{x}_b - \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{bb}^{-1} \mathbf{m})^T \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{bb} (\mathbf{x}_b - \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{bb}^{-1} \mathbf{m}) + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{m}^T \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{bb}^{-1} \mathbf{m}.
$$

This expression allows us to conduct the Gaussian integral over $\mathbf{x}_b$ straightforwardly because the integral of a squared Gaussian function over its domain is a well-defined operation, greatly simplifying the calculation of the marginal distribution of $\mathbf{x}_a$.
