## Explain the importance of the symmetry property of the covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ in Gaussian distributions.

The covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ in Gaussian distributions is crucial as it determines the spread and orientation of the distribution. Given by the matrix

$$
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{a a} & \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{a b} \\
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{b a} & \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{b b}
\end{array}\right),
$$

its symmetry property ($\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{\mathrm{T}}=\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$) ensures that $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{b a} = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{a b}^{\mathrm{T}}$, and that $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{a a}$ and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{b b}$ are themselves symmetric. This symmetry implies that the covariance matrix is real and positive semi-definite, crucial for defining a valid multivariate Gaussian distribution, where the probability density function must be non-negative everywhere.

## What is a precision matrix $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ and how is it derived from the covariance matrix?

The precision matrix $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ is defined as the inverse of the covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$. This relationship is expressed by

$$
\boldsymbol{\Lambda} = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}.
$$

The precision matrix plays an essential role in multivariate Gaussian distributions because it appears in the quadratic form of the exponent in the distribution's density function. Specifically, the precision matrix geometrically represents the inverse of the covariance: while covariance measures the variability of variables together, precision measures the level of 'precision' we can expect around the mean, acting as a measure of inverse variance in multiple dimensions.

## How does the partitioned form of the precision matrix $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ relate to its covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$?

The partitioned form of the precision matrix $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ can be given as:

$$
\boldsymbol{\Lambda}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{a a} & \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{a b} \\
\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{b a} & \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{b b}
\end{array}\right),
$$

matching the partitioned form of the covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$. It's critical to note that elements such as $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{a a}$ are not just the inverse of $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{a a}$. The relationships involve more complex matrix algebra where the inversion of the full matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ depends on all parts of its structure. This illustrates the intertwined nature of variance and correlation in multivariate spaces.

## Derive the conditional distribution $p\left(\mathbf{x}_{a} \mid \mathbf{x}_{b}\right)$ using the precision matrix.

Given the quadratic exponent form from a Gaussian distribution and the matrix partitions, 

$$
-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\Lambda}(\mathbf{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu}),
$$

we partition $\mathbf{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ into $\mathbf{x}_a, \mathbf{x}_b$ and $\boldsymbol{\mu}_a, \boldsymbol{\mu}_b$ respectively, yielding a quadratic expression. This form reveals that the conditional distribution $p(\mathbf{x}_a \mid \mathbf{x}_b)$ is Gaussian, where its mean and covariance can be derived from rearranging terms in the expression and factoring $\mathbf{x}_a$. This process invokes relations established by the partitions of $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$, and involves completing the square.

## What mathematical technique is employed with Gaussian distributions to handle expressions involving the conditional distribution $p(\mathbf{x}_{a} \mid \mathbf{x}_{b})$?

When handling Gaussian distributions to find expressions for conditional distributions such as $p(\mathbf{x}_{a} \mid \mathbf{x}_{b})$, the technique of "completing the square" is often used. This method involves rearranging the quadratic terms in the expression for the joint density function to isolate terms involving $\mathbf{x}_a$ after substituting a fixed $\mathbf{x}_b$. This allows deriving a simplified quadratic form, which directly gives the mean and covariance of the conditional distribution, highlighting the Gaussian nature of $p(\mathbf{x}_{a} \mid \mathbf{x}_{b})$.
