## What does the Central Limit Theorem assert about the distribution of the mean of $N$ uniformly distributed random variables?

The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the mean of $N$ uniformly distributed random variables tends towards a Gaussian distribution as $N$ increases. This phenomenon is observed even when each individual random variable has a uniform distribution across an interval, such as $[0,1]$.

In mathematical terms, for $N$ variables $x_1, \ldots, x_N$, uniformly distributed, the distribution of the mean $\frac{x_1 + \cdots + x_N}{N}$ increasingly resembles a Gaussian distribution as $N$ becomes large.

## How is the binomial distribution related to the Gaussian distribution as per the given text?

The binomial distribution, parameterized by $N$, tends towards a Gaussian distribution as $N \rightarrow \infty$. This convergence is noted under the framework of the Central Limit Theorem, which posits that the sum (or equivalently, the mean) of a large number of random variables, irrespective of their individual distributions, will approximate a Gaussian distribution if conditions are met.

Specifically, the binomial distribution which arises from the sum of $N$ observations of a random binary variable $x$, will demonstrate this shift towards a Gaussian shape with increasing $N$.

## Define Mahalanobis distance and its relevance in the context of the Gaussian distribution.

Mahalanobis distance, denoted as $\Delta$, is defined via the equation:

$$
\Delta^{2}=(\mathbf{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}(\mathbf{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu}),
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is a vector in the space, $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is the mean vector, and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is the covariance matrix. This distance measure is crucial in the Gaussian distribution, as it appears in the exponent of the Gaussian formula, determining how the probability density diminishes with distance from the mean. When $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is the identity matrix, $\Delta$ simplifies to the Euclidean distance.

## Discuss the implication of $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ being symmetric in the context of Gaussian distributions.

In the mathematics of Gaussian distributions, particularly in the representation of the quadratic form within the exponent, the covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is assumed to be symmetric. The reason is that in the quadratic form expression:

$$
(\mathbf{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} (\mathbf{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu}),
$$

any antisymmetric component of $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ does not contribute to the result because it cancels out due to the properties of matrix operations in symmetric and antisymmetric components. This symmetry assumption is not just a mathematical convenience but also essential for the properties like eigen decompositions which are fundamental in understanding and computing with Gaussian distributions.

## How does increasing $N$ influence the approximation to a Gaussian distribution in the context of summing uniformly distributed random variables?

As $N$ (the number of terms in the sum) increases, the distribution of the summed variable progressively approximates a Gaussian distribution, a phenomenon illustrated in the paper's discussion and confirmed by the Central Limit Theorem. The theorem implies that for a large $N$, the mean of these $N$ uniformly distributed variables $\left(\frac{x_1 + \cdots + x_N}{N}\right)$ will closely resemble a Gaussian distribution, emphasizing the robustness of the Gaussian model in statistical practices and its utility in approximating distributions of sample means.
