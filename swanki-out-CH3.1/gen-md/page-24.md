## Describe how the marginal density $p(\mathbf{x})$ is computed for a Gaussian mixture.
The marginal density for a Gaussian Mixture Model is computed as:
$$
p(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{k=1}^{K} p(k) p(\mathbf{x} \mid k)
$$
where $p(k)$ represents the mixing coefficient or the probability of selecting the $k$th component, and $p(\mathbf{x} \mid k)$ is the component density modeled as a Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_k, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k)$.

## What is the formula for the responsibility $\gamma_k(\mathbf{x})$ in a Gaussian mixture model?
The responsibility $\gamma_k(\mathbf{x})$, which represents the posterior probability of the $k$th component given the data $\mathbf{x}$, is calculated as:
$$
\gamma_{k}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\pi_{k} \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{k}\right)}{\sum_{l=1}^{K} \pi_{l} \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{l}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{l}\right)}
$$
Here, $\pi_k$ is the prior probability of the $k$th component, and $\mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{k}\right)$ is the Gaussian distribution for the $k$th component.

## How is the log-likelihood function expressed in the context of Gaussian mixture models?
For a Gaussian mixture model, the log-likelihood function given the parameters $\boldsymbol{\pi}, \boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ and observed data $\mathbf{X}$ is:
$$
\ln p(\mathbf{X} \mid \boldsymbol{\pi}, \boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \ln \left\{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_{k} \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{k}\right)\right\}
$$
This formulation incorporates the complexity of having multiple mixture components and the challenge of the log sum of exponentials, which is common in the computational aspects of mixture models.

## Identify and describe the parameter sets that govern a Gaussian mixture distribution.
A Gaussian mixture distribution is governed by the parameter sets:
- $\boldsymbol{\pi} = \{\pi_1, \dots, \pi_K\}$: Mixing coefficients representing the weights of each Gaussian component in the mixture.
- $\boldsymbol{\mu} = \{\boldsymbol{\mu}_1, \dots, \boldsymbol{\mu}_K\}$: Mean vectors for each of the $K$ Gaussian distributions.
- $\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_1, \dots, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_K\}$: Covariance matrices for each Gaussian component.

These parameters are crucial as they define both the shape and behavior of the mixture distribution across the multidimensional data space.

## Explain the implications of the summation in the logarithm of the likelihood function for Gaussian Mixture Models.
In Gaussian Mixture Models, the log-likelihood function includes a summation inside the logarithm:
$$
\ln \left\{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_{k} \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{k}\right)\right\}
$$
This component of the equation adds complexity by necessitating the computation of a log of sum of exponentials, which is a non-trivial operation both computationally and statistically. This is because it involves the interactions between multiple mixture components and their respective contributions to the probability of observed data points.
