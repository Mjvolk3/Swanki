The probability distributions discussed are used to model the probability distribution $p(\mathbf{x})$ for a random variable $\mathbf{x}$, based on observed data $\mathbf{x}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_{N}$. These distributions serve as building blocks for more complex models and are fundamental in addressing problems of density estimation.

The distributions detailed in this chapter are designed as foundational elements for creating more advanced statistical models. They are particularly significant in modeling the probability distribution of random variables based on a finite sample, and in processes known as density estimation.
