## What statistical issue does the single Gaussian distribution present when modeling the data shown in part (a) of the image?

The single Gaussian distribution, as used in part (a), fails to accurately account for the distribution of data that clearly consists of two distinct clusters. It places most of its probability mass in the central region between the clusters where the data points are sparse, thus providing a poor fit for the data structure observed.

## Explain how the model in part (b) using a linear combination of two Gaussians improves on the shortcomings observed in part (a).

Unlike the single Gaussian model, the model in part (b) using a linear combination of two Gaussians effectively addresses the issue of the two distinct clusters. This model aligns a Gaussian distribution to each cluster, appropriately modeling their individual characteristics and densities. By doing so, it achieves a better representation of the data by correctly identifying and encompassing the regions of high-density points within each cluster.
