In K-nearest neighbor density estimation, the parameter $K$ governs the degree of smoothing of the estimated density model. A smaller $K$ results in a noisier density model, as seen in the top panel of the provided graph, where $K=1$ exhibits rapid oscillations and high sensitivity to individual data points. Conversely, a larger $K$ value smooths out detailed features of the distribution, as illustrated in the graph's bottom panel with $K=30$, where the estimation robustly mirrors the bimodal nature of the actual distribution indicated by the green curve without capturing finer details.

## What are the consequences of selecting a very small $K$ in a $K$-nearest neighbor density estimation as demonstrated in the provided graph?

Selecting a very small $K$ value in $K$-nearest neighbor density estimation can lead to a very noisy density model with high variability and extreme sensitivity to local data points. This is evident from the top panel of the provided graph where $K=1$. Here, the estimated density (blue line) shows high fluctuations, which deviate significantly from the true underlying distribution (green curve). This extreme variability can limit the estimation's usefulness by failing to accurately capture and represent overarching data trends and increases the risk of overfitting to random fluctuations in the data.
