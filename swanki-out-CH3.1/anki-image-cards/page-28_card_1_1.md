## How is the concentration parameter \( m \) reflected in the Cartesian and polar plots of the von Mises distribution, as observed in Figure 3.11?

The concentration parameter \( m \) in the von Mises distribution is analogous to the inverse variance in a Gaussian distribution, indicating the 'tightness' or 'spread' of the distribution around the mean direction \( \theta_0 \). In the Cartesian plot, a higher \( m \) (red curve with \( m = 5 \)) results in a narrower and taller peak, demonstrating a higher density around the mean direction \( \frac{\pi}{4} \). On the polar plot, the same high \( m \) value manifests as a sharply defined bump around \( \frac{\pi}{4} \), indicating a strong concentration in this direction. Conversely, a lower \( m \) (blue curve with \( m = 1 \)) shows a wider and flatter curve on the Cartesian plot and a more spread out radius on the polar plot, indicating greater dispersion around the mean direction \( \frac{3\pi}{4} \).

## Difference between Cartesian and polar representation of the von Mises distribution as seen in the plots of Figure 3.11.

The primary difference lies in how the variables are represented on each plot. In the Cartesian plot, the horizontal axis likely represents the angle \( \theta \) with the vertical axis showing the probability density. This plot facilitates observing the density function's shape and comparing densities at specific angles. In the polar plot, the angle \( \theta \) is mapped to the physical angle from the positive horizontal axis, and the radius indicates the magnitude of the probability density for that angle. This plot offers an intuitive visual representation of the density's directional nature on a circle, making it easier to visualize the periodic aspect of the distribution and its concentration around the mean direction.
