## What is the form of the covariance matrix for the Gaussian distribution depicted in image (c), and how does it influence the shape of the probability density contours?

The covariance matrix in image (c) is proportional to the identity matrix, i.e., $\Sigma = \sigma^2 I$. This structure makes the Gaussian distribution isotropic, meaning the variance is the same in all directions, which results in the probability density contours being concentric circles around the mean $\mu$. Each circle represents a zone where the probability density of the distribution remains constant.

## How does the isotropic nature of the Gaussian distribution shown in image (c) restrict the representation capabilities of the distribution, according to the associated text?

The isotropic Gaussian distribution, characterized by a covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix, inherently limits the distribution's ability to capture interesting correlations in data. Specifically, such a structure is unimodal (has a single peak) and cannot approximate multimodal distributions effectively. This introduces restrictions in terms of both flexibility, due to the simplicity of the covariance structure, and limitation, because it can only represent distributions concentrated around a single mode.
