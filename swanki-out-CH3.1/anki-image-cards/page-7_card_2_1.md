## What is the distribution trend observed in the histograms when \( N \) increases, according to Figure 3.2?

As \( N \) increases, the distribution of the mean of \( N \) uniformly distributed numbers tends towards a Gaussian distribution. This is consistent with the central limit theorem, which states that the mean of a sufficiently large number of independent random variables, each with a well-defined mean and variance, will approximately follow a Gaussian distribution, regardless of the underlying distribution.

## According to Exercise 3.11, what type of distribution maximizes the entropy for a single real variable?

The distribution that maximizes entropy for a single real variable is the Gaussian distribution. This statement holds under constraints typically involving the fixing of the mean and variance. The entropy measure used in this context is Shannon entropy, which is utilized in information theory to quantify the information produced by a random source of data.
