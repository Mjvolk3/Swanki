Values of a periodic variable $\theta_n$ are represented as two-dimensional vectors $\mathbf{x}_{n}$ on a unit circle using the expressions $\mathbf{x}_{n} = (\cos \theta_n, \sin \theta_n)$. This representation projects each value onto the unit circle, creating a vector that corresponds to each angle $\theta_n$.

## How is the mean vector $\overline{\mathbf{x}}$ computed from the individual vectors on a unit circle, and what does its direction represent?

The mean vector $\overline{\mathbf{x}}$ is computed as $\overline{\mathbf{x}} = (\bar{r} \cos \bar{\theta}, \bar{r} \sin \bar{\theta})$, where each component is derived from the average of the cosine and sine components of the individual vectors:

$$
\bar{x}_{1}=\bar{r} \cos \bar{\theta}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \cos \theta_{n}, \quad \bar{x}_{2}=\bar{r} \sin \bar{\theta}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sin \theta_{n}
$$

The direction of $\overline{\mathbf{x}}$ represents the mean angle $\bar{\theta}$ where the magnitude $\bar{r}$ may suggest the concentration of the vectors around this mean, potentially defining a robust average that minimizes issues related to circular data averaging.
