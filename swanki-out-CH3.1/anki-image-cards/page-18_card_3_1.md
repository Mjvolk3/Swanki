The blue curve represents the marginal distribution of the random variable \( x_a \), denoted \( p(x_a) \). The red curve depicts the conditional distribution \( p(x_a \mid x_b=0.7) \), representing the probability of \( x_a \) given that \( x_b \) is fixed at 0.7.

## Analyze the implications of the distributions plotted in Figure 3.5(b) regarding the uncertainty in \( x_a \) given \( x_b \).

The greater variance of the blue curve (marginal distribution \( p(x_a) \)) compared to the red curve (conditional distribution \( p(x_a \mid x_b=0.7) \)) suggests a higher uncertainty in the value of \( x_a \) when \( x_b \) is unknown. Conversely, the narrower red curve indicates reduced uncertainty and a more definitive expectation for \( x_a \) when \( x_b \) is known to be 0.7, thus illustrating the impact of additional information (conditioning on \( x_b \)) on the uncertainty of \( x_a \).
