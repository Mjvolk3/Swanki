The contour lines in the bivariate Gaussian distribution plot represent regions of constant probability density. This means at any point along a specific contour line, the density value is constant. As you move from the center towards the edges, the density decreases, which is indicated by the spacing between the contour lines becoming wider.

## Explain how the conditional distribution \( p(x_a \mid x_b) \) is depicted in the plot shown.

In the plot, the conditional distribution \( p(x_a \mid x_b) \) is depicted as a red horizontal line at \( x_b = 0.7 \). This red line specifies the value \( x_b \) at which the conditional distribution is evaluated, showing how \( p(x_a \mid x_b) \) varies along \( x_a \) while \( x_b \) is held constant at 0.7. The intersection of this line with the contours indicates the respective probability densities at different \( x_a \) values given \( x_b = 0.7 \).
