The $K$-nearest neighbors classifier classifies a new point (shown by the black diamond in the image) by identifying the $K$ closest points in the training data set and assigning the new point to the class that has the largest number of representatives amongst these $K$ points. In the case illustrated, $K=3$.

## What is the classification rule for the nearest-neighbor ($K=1$) approach, and how does it impact the decision boundary visualized in the provided image?

In the nearest-neighbor ($K=1$) approach, a test point is assigned to the same class as the nearest point from the training set. The resulting decision boundary, which can be observed as a green line in the provided image, is composed of hyperplanes that form perpendicular bisectors of pairs of points from different classes, creating a highly nonlinear and intricate pattern that closely adapts to the configuration of the individual data points around the boundary.
