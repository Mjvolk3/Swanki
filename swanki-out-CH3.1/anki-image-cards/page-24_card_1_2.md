The Gaussian component with the highest mixing coefficient is the red Gaussian, with $$\pi_1 = 0.5$$. This implies that, in this Gaussian mixture model, the red component contributes the most to the overall mixture probability density. This component will have the highest weight in determining the characteristics of the mixture, influencing where the mixture model is most likely to generate data points or predict their occurrence.

## Explain how the contours in part (b) of Figure 3.8 arise from the components shown in part (a).

The contours in part (b) of Figure 3.8 represent the marginal probability density $$p(\mathbf{x})$$ of the Gaussian mixture distribution. These contours are derived from the weighted sum of the individual Gaussian components shown in part (a), where the weights are their respective mixing coefficients: $\pi_1 = 0.5$, $\pi_2 = 0.3$, and $\pi_3 = 0.2$. The contours in (b) encapsulate regions where the resulting mixture density from combining these three components is roughly constant. This visualization shows the effect of superimposing the individual Gaussian distributions, illustrating how their collective influence shapes the probability landscape of the mixture.
