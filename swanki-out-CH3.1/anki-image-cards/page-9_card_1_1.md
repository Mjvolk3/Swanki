The red ellipse represents a surface of constant probability density in a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution, where the density is $\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)$ times the value at the mean $\mathbf{x} = \mu$. The axes of the ellipse are defined by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, indicating the principal directions of the distribution.

## How is the Jacobian matrix $\mathbf{J}$ defined for the transformation from the $\mathbf{x}$ to the $\mathbf{y}$ coordinate system in the context of Gaussian distributions?

The Jacobian matrix $\mathbf{J}$, used to transform from the $\mathbf{x}$ coordinate system to the $\mathbf{y}$ coordinate system in Gaussian distributions, is defined as:

$$
J_{ij} = \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial y_j} = U_{ji}
$$

where $U_{ji}$ are the elements of the matrix $\mathbf{U}^{\mathrm{T}}$. This transformation aligns the new axis of the coordinate system with the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix $\mathbf{U}$.
