The parameter $m$ in the von Mises distribution represents the concentration parameter, which is analogous to the inverse variance (precision) in the Gaussian distribution. Higher values of $m$ indicate a higher peak and narrower distribution, suggesting more certainty or concentration around the mean direction $\theta_0$. This is depicted graphically where the red curve with $m=5$ is sharper and more peaked compared to the blue curve with $m=1$, which is broader and flatter.

## Based on the graphs, how does the change in the parameter $m$ affect the shape of the von Mises distribution?

As $m$, the concentration parameter of the von Mises distribution, increases, the shape of the distribution becomes narrower and more peaked around the mean direction $\theta_0$. This is visually evident in the provided Cartesian and polar plots, where the red curve ($m=5$) is significantly sharper and narrower than the blue curve ($m=1$). The less concentrated curve (lower $m$ value) spreads more evenly across possible values, indicating greater uncertainty or variance around the mean angle.
