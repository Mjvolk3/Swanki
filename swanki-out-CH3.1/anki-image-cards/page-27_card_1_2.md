The von Mises distribution is derived by conditioning a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution defined by $$ p\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma^{2}} \exp \left\{-\frac{\left(x_{1}-\mu_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(x_{2}-\mu_{2}\right)^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}}\right\} $$ on the unit circle. It transforms from Cartesian to polar coordinates, setting \( r = 1 \), thus becoming periodic but not normalized along the circle.

## How does converting Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates affect the distribution along the unit circle in the derivation of the von Mises distribution?

Converting from Cartesian coordinates \(\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)\) to polar coordinates \( r, \theta \) where \( x_{1} = r \cos \theta \) and \( x_{2} = r \sin \theta \) and setting \( r = 1 \) for the unit circle, the Gaussian distribution transforms into a periodic distribution, depicted by the concentric circles in the image. This transformation is key to deriving the von Mises distribution.
