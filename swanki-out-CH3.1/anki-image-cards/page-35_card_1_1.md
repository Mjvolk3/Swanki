Changing the bin width $\Delta$ significantly influences the histogram's ability to approximate the underlying distribution from which the data is drawn. 

- A smaller $\Delta$, as seen in the histogram with $\Delta=0.04$, results in a finer granularity that may capture noise and minute details, potentially leading to overfitting.
- A medium $\Delta$ ($\Delta=0.08$) offers a balance, smoothing out some noise while still providing sufficient detail to capture the main features of the distribution.
- A larger $\Delta$ ($\Delta=0.25$) simplifies the histogram too much, possibly smoothing out important features such as modes of the distribution, and may result in underfitting.

Each bin width illustrates a different trade-off between bias and variance, highlighting the importance of selecting an optimal $\Delta$ for accurate density estimation.

The probability $p_i$ for the $i$-th bin in a histogram is derived from the count $n_i$ of samples falling into the bin, the total number of observations $N$, and the bin width $\Delta_i$. The formula is given by:

$$
p_i = \frac{n_i}{N \Delta_i}
$$

This formula transforms the raw count into a probability density by normalizing with respect to the total number of data points and the bin width. If all bins have the same width ($\Delta_i = \Delta$), the expression simplifies to $\frac{n_i}{N\Delta}$. 

### Properties:
- **Normalization:** The sum over all bins $\sum_i p_i \Delta_i = 1$, ensuring the total probability is 1.
- **Flexibility:** Varying $\Delta_i$ can adapt the histogram to more accurately reflect the underlying distribution or to focus on specific features of the data.
- **Bin Width Dependency:** The choice of bin width directly impacts the granularity and possibly the accuracy of the density estimation, as different widths can either obscure or reveal key features of the distribution.

This formulation is useful to generate a piecewise constant approximation of the probability density function, providing a simple yet powerful tool for initial data analysis and visualization.
