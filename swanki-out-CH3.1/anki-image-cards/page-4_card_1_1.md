The expected value \( \mathbb{E}[m] \) and variance \( \operatorname{var}[m] \) of the binomial distribution plotted in this histogram for \( N=10 \) and \( \mu=0.25 \) are computed using the formulas:

$$
\mathbb{E}[m] = N \mu = 10 \times 0.25 = 2.5
$$

$$
\operatorname{var}[m] = N \mu (1 - \mu) = 10 \times 0.25 \times 0.75 = 1.875
$$

These calculations align with the plot, where the bars' height around \( m = 2.5 \) is comparatively higher, suggesting the proximity of mean, and the spread around it indicating the variance.

## Describe the "Choosing coefficient" as it is applied in the binomial distribution and compute the value for $m=3$, $N=10$.

The "Choosing coefficient" \( \binom{N}{m} \) in the context of the binomial distribution represents the number of ways to choose \( m \) successes out of \( N \) trials. It is calculated as:

$$
\binom{N}{m} = \frac{N!}{(N-m)!m!}
$$

For \( m=3 \) and \( N=10 \):

$$
\binom{10}{3} = \frac{10!}{(10-3)!3!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 120
$$

This means there are 120 different ways to achieve 3 successes in 10 trials, which is reflected in the probability computation for the binomial distribution.
