The expected number of successes $m$ in the binomial distribution for $N = 10$ and $\mu = 0.25$ is $N\mu$, which calculates as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[m] = N \mu = 10 \times 0.25 = 2.5
$$

## Given the histogram in the image, summarize the probabilities of observing different numbers of successes in a binomial experiment with parameters $N=10$ and $\mu=0.25$.

The histogram represents a binomial distribution for $N = 10$ trials and success probability $\mu = 0.25$. It visually indicates that the probability of obtaining lower or higher numbers of successes ($m$) decreases as $m$ moves away from the mean. The binomial probabilities are conveyed through the height of each bar, which denotes the probability of achieving exactly $m$ successes out of 10 trials. Values closer to the expected mean of $2.5$ have higher bars, indicating a higher likelihood, yet the discrete nature of the distribution means the highest is likely near $m=3$.
