The graph displays two distinct functions; on the left, the Bessel function $I_0(m)$, which increases steeply with $m$, reflecting its typical behavior in mathematical physics. On the right, the function $A(m) = \frac{I_1(m)}{I_0(m)}$, beginning at 0 and asymptotically approaching 1, illustrates how the ratio of the first-order to the zeroth-order Bessel functions behaves as $m$ increases. This relationship indicates that as $m$ increases, $I_1(m)$ grows to approximate $I_0(m)$ closely, hence $A(m)$ approaching 1.

## Explain how $\theta_{0}^{ML}$ is derived and its significance in maximizing the likelihood function detailing the trigonometric identities involved.

The derivation of $\theta_{0}^{ML}$ is based on maximizing the likelihood function by equating the first derivative to zero, specifically in the context of data points represented in a two-dimensional Cartesian space. $$\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{ML}}=\tan^{-1}\left\{\frac{\sum_{n} \sin \theta_{n}}{\sum_{n} \cos \theta_{n}}\right\}$$ This represents the angle $\theta_0$ that aligns the mean resultant vector of a circular data set, assuming unimodal distribution around $\theta_0$. It's significant as it provides a point estimate of the central tendency in circular statistics, effectively turning sinusoidal components of individual data points into a collective directional estimate.
