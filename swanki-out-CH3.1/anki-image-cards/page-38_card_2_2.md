## What effect does the parameter $h$ have on the kernel density estimation as shown in the linked graph, and what are the consequences of setting $h$ too small or too large?

In the context of kernel density estimation, the parameter $h$, known as the bandwidth or smoothing parameter, primarily influences the smoothness of the resulting density curve. If $h$ is set too small, as depicted in the top panel of the linked graph, the resulting density model becomes very noisy and sensitive to individual data points, leading to overfitting. Conversely, if $h$ is set too large, the density estimate becomes overly smooth, potentially washing out important features of the data distribution such as bimodality, as seen in the bottom panel of the graph. Hence, an intermediate value of $h$ often yields the most accurate representation of the underlying data distribution.

## Explain the mathematical formulation and normalization process used in the kernel density estimation model, as mentioned in the description.

The kernel density estimation (KDE) model applies a Gaussian kernel over each data point in a set, summed to estimate the probability density function. The KDE formula for a set of $N$ data points in a $D$-dimensional space using a Gaussian kernel is given by:

$$
p(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{\left(2 \pi h^{2}\right)^{D / 2}} \exp \left\{-\frac{\left\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{n}\right\|^2}{2 h^2}\right\}
$$

Here, the normalization factor $\frac{1}{\left(2 \pi h^{2}\right)^{D / 2}}$ ensures that the Gaussian function is a proper probability density, which must integrate to $1$ over its domain. The division by $N$ is required so that $p(\mathbf{x})$ sums to $1$ across all data, ensuring that the resulting function is a valid probability density function over the data space.
