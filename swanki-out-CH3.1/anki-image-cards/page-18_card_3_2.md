The distributions shown in Figure 3.5(b) are probability density functions. The blue curve represents the marginal distribution of a random variable \( x_a \), denoted as \( p(x_a) \). The red curve represents the conditional probability distribution \( p(x_a | x_b = 0.7) \), indicating the distribution of \( x_a \) given that another variable \( x_b \) is fixed at 0.7.

## Explain the impact of conditioning on the variance of distributions shown in Figure 3.5(b)

In Figure 3.5(b), conditioning on a variable \( x_b = 0.7 \) affects the variance of the distribution of \( x_a \). The red curve, representing the conditional distribution \( p(x_a | x_b = 0.7) \), is noticeably narrower and peaks higher than the blue curve, which represents the marginal distribution \( p(x_a) \). This indicates a reduced variance for \( x_a \) when \( x_b \) is known, implying greater certainty about the value of \( x_a \). Hence, conditioning on \( x_b \) provides additional information that tightens the distribution.
