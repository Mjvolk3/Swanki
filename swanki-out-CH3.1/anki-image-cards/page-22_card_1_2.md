The scatter plot with red contour lines represents the probability density of a single Gaussian distribution fitted to the data, which remarkably fails to capture the two clumps observed in the data and places much of its probability mass in sparse areas between these clumps. This shows the limitation of using a single Gaussian to model multimodal data distributions like the one in Old Faithful geyser eruption durations and intervals.

## How does the mean update formula displayed express incorporating a new data point $\mathbf{x}_N$ into the existing estimated mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N-1)}$?

The mean update formula:
$$
\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N)} = \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N-1)} + \frac{1}{N}(\mathbf{x}_N - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N-1)})
$$
represents the revised estimate of the maximum likelihood mean after observing a new data point $\mathbf{x}_N$. This is obtained by moving the previous mean estimate $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N-1)}$ in the direction of the error signal $(\mathbf{x}_N - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N-1)})$, scaled by $\frac{1}{N}$, reducing the impact of each subsequent data point on the mean as $N$ increases.
