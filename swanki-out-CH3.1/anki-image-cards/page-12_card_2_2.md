## What geometric shapes do the contours take in a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution where the covariance matrix is proportional to the identity matrix, as shown in the image?

The contours form concentric circles centered about the mean. Each circle represents a constant probability density, and their circular shape indicates that the variance is the same in every direction from the center.

## How does the form of the covariance matrix in a Gaussian distribution determine the orientation and shape of its density contours?

In a Gaussian distribution, a covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix results in isotropic properties (uniform in all orientations), leading to concentric circular contours of constant probability density. In contrast, other forms of the covariance matrix can result in elliptical contours that may align with or be skewed relative to coordinate axes, depending on matrix values.
