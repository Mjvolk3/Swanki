The histograms in the image demonstrate how changes in bin width $\Delta$ affect the density estimation from a given data set of 50 points, which was generated from a distribution shown by the green curve. Smaller bin widths lead to spikey histograms that may capture noise, as seen with $\Delta = 0.04$. A moderate bin width, like $\Delta = 0.08$, offers a more balanced representation, highlighting some structural details of the distribution. Larger bin widths, such as $\Delta = 0.25$, tend to oversimplify the distribution, smoothing out significant features like the bimodal peaks.

## How is the normalized probability density $p_i$ for each bin calculated from the histogram data, and what ensures it integrates to 1 across the distribution?

The normalized probability density for each bin, $p_i$, is computed using the formula:

$$
p_i = \frac{n_i}{N \Delta_i}
$$

where $n_i$ is the count of data points in bin $i$, $N$ is the total number of observations, and $\Delta_i$ is the width of the bin. The integral of the probability densities over all bins equals 1, i.e., $\int p(x) \mathrm{d} x = 1$, ensuring that the histogram represents a proper probability distribution. The histogram provides a piecewise constant model for the density $p(x)$, which is effective for visualizing and estimating the underlying data distribution.
