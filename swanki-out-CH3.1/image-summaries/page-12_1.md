ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a two-dimensional graph with coordinates \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). On this graph, there are concentric elliptical contours that represent levels of constant probability density for a 2D Gaussian distribution. The ellipses are centered around a point which is the mean of the distribution, and the orientation and shape of the ellipses correspond to the covariance structure of the distribution. This particular graph represents a Gaussian distribution with a general form of the covariance matrix, where the principal axes of the ellipses are not aligned with the coordinate axes. This indicates that there is some correlation between \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) in the distribution.
