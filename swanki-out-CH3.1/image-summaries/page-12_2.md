ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided is likely to be the one referred to in the paper's context as part (c), which is described as showing the contours of constant probability density for a Gaussian distribution in two dimensions where the covariance matrix is proportional to the identity matrix. As a result, the contours are concentric circles. The description indicates that the Gaussian distribution in this case is isotropic, meaning that it is the same in all directions, and the probability density does not depend on the direction, only on the distance from the mean. 

In the image, you would see a series of concentric circles centered on a point that represents the mean (μ) of the distribution. The variance (σ^2) would be the same in every direction from this mean, which is why the contours form circles rather than ellipses. Each circle represents a contour where the probability density of the Gaussian distribution is constant. As you move outward from the center, each successive circle typically corresponds to a lower probability density.
