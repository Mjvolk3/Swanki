ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts a graphical representation of a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution with isotropic covariance. This is visualized through the contours of constant probability density, which are shown as concentric circles centered around the mean of the distribution. An isotropic covariance matrix means that the variances in all directions are equal, resulting in these circular contours as opposed to elliptical ones that would be seen with an anisotropic (direction-dependent) covariance. The density is highest at the center and decreases as one moves away from the center, reflecting the characteristics of a Gaussian distribution. This matches the description for Figure 3.4(c) as mentioned in the provided contextual information.
