ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided shows a 2-dimensional scatter plot with two distinct classes of points: one represented by red dots and the other by blue dots. A black diamond symbol, presumably representing a new data point, is also present in the plot. The green lines drawn from the black diamond suggest that this point's classification is determined by measuring its proximity to the nearest neighbouring points from the two classes. This is a visual representation of a k-nearest neighbour classifier, where in this example \( K \) seems to be 3, meaning that the classification of the black diamond point is influenced by the 3 closest points from the existing classes. The axes are labeled \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \), indicating the two dimensions of the feature space for the data points shown.
