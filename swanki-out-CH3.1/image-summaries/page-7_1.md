ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image contains two side-by-side histogram plots. Both histograms display the distribution of values within the range of 0 to 1 on the x-axis. On the y-axis, there are numerical values possibly indicating the frequency or probability density of the observations within each bin of the histogram.

The histogram on the left is labeled "N = 1" and shows a uniform distribution, with each bin having an equally tall bar, indicating that there is an equal frequency of the variable's occurrence in each interval.

The histogram on the right is labeled "N = 2" and shows a distribution that is beginning to take on a bell-shaped form, suggesting that observations are more likely to occur around the central values and less likely towards the extremes of 0 and 1.

The context provided describes that as the number "N" of uniformly distributed variables increases, the distribution of their mean tends towards a Gaussian distribution. This illustrates a demonstration of the Central Limit Theorem, where the mean of a large number of uniformly distributed variables will approach a normal (Gaussian) distribution, even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. The histograms in the image likely represent an early stage of this phenomenon, with "N = 1" not showing a Gaussian shape and "N = 2" displaying a more pronounced central peak.
