ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided is an illustration that accompanies a mathematical discussion on the von Mises distribution in the context of periodic variables and their representations on a circle. This figure is intended to demonstrate how a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution can be converted into a periodic distribution by taking the value of the distribution along a circle of fixed radius (in this case, the unit circle).

In the image, you can see:
- A Cartesian coordinate system with axes \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \).
- A red circle with radius \( r = 1 \), representing the unit circle upon which the periodic variable lies.
- Blue concentric level curves, which are the density contours of a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution centered at some point in the plane. These contours are equidistant from each other, indicating a constant increase in the value of the probability density function \( p(\mathbf{x}) \) from the outermost to the innermost curve.

This visual is meant to show the relationship between a standard Gaussian distribution over Cartesian coordinates and its adaptation to a circular or periodic domain, leading to the von Mises distribution when conditioned on the unit circle.
