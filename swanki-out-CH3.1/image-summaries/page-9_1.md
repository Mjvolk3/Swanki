ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a two-dimensional graphical illustration of a Gaussian probability density function. It includes the following elements:

- An ellipse (red curve), representing a surface of constant probability density for a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution.
- The \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) axes, representing a two-dimensional space in which the distribution exists.
- Two eigenvectors, \( \mathbf{u}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{u}_2 \), depicted as black arrows, indicating the principal directions of the distribution, with their origin at the mean \( \boldsymbol{\mu} \) of the distribution.
- The mean \( \boldsymbol{\mu} \) is represented as a blue dot at the center of the ellipse.
- Two orthogonal coordinate axes, \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \), shown as blue arrows, which are aligned with the eigenvectors and represent the new coordinate system defined by the eigenvectors.
- The scaling factors \( \lambda_1^{1/2} \) and \( \lambda_2^{1/2} \), illustrated as arrow lengths along the \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) axes, corresponding to the square roots of the eigenvalues associated with the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.

This figure visualizes how a multivariate Gaussian distribution can be characterized by its mean and covariance structure, with the eigenvectors aligning with the directions of maximum variance. The ellipsoid represents the shape of the probability density, and the length of the axes of the ellipsoid reflects the magnitude of the eigenvalues, which are a measure of the spread of the distribution along the corresponding eigenvector.
