Chapter 7 - Giving Cell Biology an Institutional Identity

In the early stages of cell biology, new research techniques such as electron microscopy and cell fractionation opened up unprecedented opportunities. These techniques allowed researchers to explore the mechanisms inside cells in ways that were previously impossible. The first significant outcomes of these efforts included detailed descriptions of oxidative metabolism in mitochondria, protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, protein transport in the Golgi apparatus, and the breakdown of cellular material in lysosomes. By the 1960s, these investigations had coalesced into a new field known as cell biology. This term was chosen to distinguish this emerging field from classical cytology, which focused more on morphological structures, and to emphasize the integration of both structural and functional information about cells.

For cell biology to establish itself as a lasting scientific discipline, it needed its own institutional identity. Journals and professional societies play a crucial role in this respect. They provide platforms for scientists to publish their work and gain recognition from their peers. Beyond this, these institutions shape scientific inquiry by defining and promoting specific problems and methodologies. This helps create a cohesive community with shared goals and standards.

One of the pivotal moments in the establishment of cell biology as a distinct field was the renaming of the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology to the Journal of Cell Biology in 1962. This change reflected the journal's evolving content and focus, aligning it more closely with the emerging field of cell biology. The journal's success was evident in its rapid growth in subscriptions and submissions, indicating a thriving interest in the field. The content also diversified significantly, moving beyond electron microscopy to include various technical approaches such as cytochemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology.

Section: Creation of the American Society for Cell Biology

The idea to form a specialized society for cell biology in the United States originated with Paul Weiss, who was already active in the International Society for Cell Biology. He advocated for the creation of a national society to represent the U.S. in the international community. This proposal was well-received by the Tissue Culture Association (TCA), which aimed to shift its focus from a technique-based to a subject-matter-based organization. Consequently, the TCA proposed the formation of a committee to improve collaboration among cell biologists, which led to the establishment of the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB).

Keith Porter played a significant role in shaping the ASCB. He emphasized the importance of including physiologists and biochemists to ensure a balanced representation within the new society. Despite some competition from other existing societies like the Society of General Physiologists, the committee decided to form a new, independent society. The ASCB aimed to foster interdisciplinary communication among cell biologists, which was reflected in the diverse program of its first scientific meeting in 1961.

The first ASCB meeting in Chicago was a major success, drawing 844 scientists and resulting in 744 membership applications. The meeting featured symposia on topics such as cell continuity, cell diversification, and cell interfaces, with contributions from a wide range of disciplines. This interdisciplinary approach was crucial for the society's goal of integrating different scientific perspectives within the field of cell biology.

Section: Discovering Cell Mechanisms

The formation of the ASCB and the establishment of the Journal of Cell Biology were critical steps in giving cell biology a distinct identity. These institutions provided platforms for disseminating research and fostering collaboration among scientists from various disciplines. This interdisciplinary approach was essential for advancing the understanding of cell mechanisms, as it allowed for the integration of different methodologies and perspectives.

One of the key challenges in forming the ASCB was ensuring a balanced representation of different scientific specialties. The society's founders were keen to avoid being pigeonholed into a single discipline, such as morphology. Instead, they sought to include biochemists, biophysicists, cytologists, histologists, microbiologists, and physiologists, among others. This diverse representation was crucial for addressing the complex and multifaceted problems in cell biology.

The success of the ASCB's first meeting and the Journal of Cell Biology highlighted the growing interest and recognition of cell biology as a distinct field. The interdisciplinary nature of the society and the journal facilitated the exchange of ideas and techniques, driving forward the understanding of cellular mechanisms. This collaborative and integrative approach helped establish cell biology as a vibrant and dynamic field of scientific inquiry.

Section: Establishing a Broad Scientific Community

In the early years of the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB), the leadership faced a significant challenge: ensuring the society was inclusive of various scientific disciplines. One of their strategies was to diversify the invited symposia, aiming to draw in biochemists and biophysicists. Initially, the society decided that accepting all paper submissions was impractical, so they imposed limits on the number of contributed papers for their meetings. This decision was not based solely on quality but also on the disciplinary approach. The idea was to avoid the society being pigeonholed into a single technique or discipline, such as fine structure analysis. This was a conscious effort to create a broad, interdisciplinary base.

To further this goal, the ASCB included biochemists and functionally oriented scientists in their council. For instance, David Green, a biochemist from the University of Wisconsin, was pivotal in the early council meetings. Despite some skepticism about his work on the cyclophorase system for oxidative phosphorylation, Green's involvement was part of the strategy to attract more biochemists. Similarly, Alex Novikoff, another biochemist, became president-elect and later served as the societyâ€™s second president. Their inclusion reflected the society's commitment to integrating biochemistry into its core activities.

By 1964, the society's efforts bore fruit when David Green chaired the program for the ASCB meeting, leading to a strong biochemical focus. The meeting featured a three-part symposium on biological membranes, covering topics such as energized ion translocation, contractile proteins, structural proteins, elementary particles in membrane systems, and the synthesis of mitochondria. This thematic focus aligned closely with Green's research interests, particularly his work on mitochondrial membrane particles. The inclusion of prominent biochemists like Britton Chance and Elfraim Racker, despite their differing views from Green, underscored the society's commitment to fostering a diverse scientific dialogue.

Section: Challenges and Evolution

Despite these efforts, the broader goal of integrating biochemists and biophysicists into the ASCB was only partially achieved. Biochemists and biophysicists already had established institutions and journals that provided their primary professional homes. As cell biology matured, it developed its own departments, journals, and societies, incorporating essential biochemical tools. Over time, the urgency to attract biochemists waned, and the focus shifted towards the unique identity of cell biology.

One significant decision was whether to sponsor a journal, a topic that surfaced at the ASCB council's first permanent meeting in December 1961. This decision was crucial for defining the society's role in the broader scientific community and for supporting the dissemination of research in cell biology.
Section: Collaborating with Other Journals and Promoting Cell Biology

By spring 1963, the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) had settled on the newly renamed Journal of Cell Biology, establishing a process whereby the ASCB nominated half of the editors. This move was part of a broader strategy to involve biochemists more centrally in the society, ensuring a diverse representation in cell biology research.

In addition to focusing on academic circles, the ASCB aimed to promote cell biology to the broader public. Starting in 1963, the society sponsored pre-meetings for high school teachers and later organized symposia for high school students. These initiatives were designed to educate the public and inspire the next generation of scientists. They included guided tours of research instruments, making the public aware of the tools and costs involved in scientific research.

By the end of its formative years, the ASCB had successfully established a new scientific domain that integrated both the structural and functional aspects of cell biology. This success was a result of deliberate, strategic efforts by the society's founders. These efforts included diversifying leadership, strategic program planning, and outreach initiatives. Although the ASCB could not entirely reshape the affiliations of biochemists and biophysicists, it did avoid becoming narrowly focused on morphology or electron microscopy alone.

Section: The Evolution of Cytology Journals and the Birth of Cell Biology

In the mid-20th century, the field of cytology was on the cusp of revolutionary advancements, driven by innovations like the electron microscope and X-ray diffraction methods. Cytology, which is the study of cell structures and functions, was traditionally approached from various scientific angles, including anatomy, histology, physiology, and biochemistry. However, the emergence of new physical and chemical investigation techniques particularly excited researchers, offering unprecedented insights into the submicroscopic molecular structure of cells. This period heralded the advent of a classical phase in cytological knowledge, comparable to the seminal advances in anatomy during the Vesalian period or the development of microscopic anatomy in the 19th century.

One of the pioneering figures in this transformative era was Keith Porter, whose primary interest lay in electron microscopy. Porter was committed to creating a journal that could reproduce high-quality electron micrographs, which are detailed images of cell structures captured using electron microscopes. This endeavor was essential because traditional journals like the Journal of Experimental Medicine and the Journal of Histochemistry couldn't accommodate the extensive cytological work emerging from new microscopic techniques. The high resolution required for these images demanded superior halftone engravings, which many existing publications could not provide.

However, not all scientists agreed on the direction this new journal should take. Francis Schmitt, another influential figure, argued against a narrow focus on electron microscopy. Schmitt envisioned a journal that would encompass a broader range of biophysical and biochemical studies, incorporating methodologies such as ultraviolet microscopy, phase contrast, X-ray diffraction, and other advanced techniques. His goal was to combine direct and indirect methods to achieve a detailed characterization of cellular components at the molecular level. This holistic approach aimed to integrate micromorphology with the physical and chemical properties of biological macromolecules, thus advancing a more comprehensive understanding of cell biology.

Section: Debating the Scope and Editorial Direction

The initial discussions about the journal's focus also influenced the selection of its editorial board. Porter proposed a list of eleven prominent scientists, many of whom were experts in descriptive morphology, a field that emphasizes the form and structure of cells. Schmitt, however, felt this list overrepresented morphology and suggested additional candidates to balance the focus. Ultimately, the final board included a mix of experts from various disciplines, including electron microscopy, biochemistry, biophysics, histochemistry, and cytogenetics. This diverse editorial board was crucial in ensuring that the journal covered a wide spectrum of cellular research.

The debate over the journal's focus extended to its name. Initially, the journal was considered to be called the Journal of Cytology, but some editors felt this title was too limiting and didn't adequately reflect the journal's broader mission. As a result, the name was expanded to the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology. This title was chosen to emphasize the integration of morphological, biochemical, and biophysical studies, highlighting research on cellular organization at the colloidal and molecular levels. This mission statement aimed to attract a wide range of contributions, from histochemistry and cytogenetics to advanced microscopy techniques.

Despite these efforts, the journal initially struggled to attract a balanced mix of manuscripts. Reports from the journal's early years indicate a predominance of papers focused on electron microscopy, leading to ongoing discussions about how to diversify the content. Editors like Richard Bear and Albert Lehninger took it upon themselves to address this imbalance, actively seeking more biophysical and biochemical submissions. By 1959, there was a noticeable shift, with an increasing number of non-morphological papers being submitted, suggesting that the journal was gradually being recognized for its broader interest in cell biology.

Section: The Legacy and Adaptation of the Journal

As the journal matured, it continued to evolve. One strategy to attract diverse manuscripts was to appoint editors specializing in underrepresented areas. For instance, in 1958, Paul Doty, a biophysicist, and Daniel Mazia, a cell physiologist, were added to the editorial board. This approach ensured that the journal maintained a broad scope, covering various aspects of cell biology. Additionally, the journal introduced special supplemental issues, which included translations of classical papers alongside contemporary research, further enriching its content and appeal.

Despite these efforts, the debate over the journal's name persisted. By 1960, some editors, including Porter, proposed dropping the terms "biophysical" and "biochemical" from the journal's title, arguing that other specialized journals had since emerged. However, others, like Palade, believed that the name should be retained to reflect the ongoing trends in the field. Eventually, in 1961, the name Journal of Cell Biology was proposed and adopted, signaling a more concise and inclusive representation of the journal's scope.

In summary, the establishment and evolution of the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology, later renamed the Journal of Cell Biology, reflect the dynamic nature of scientific progress. The journal's journey from a contentious inception to a respected publication underscores the importance of adaptability and interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing scientific knowledge. Through its commitment to high-quality research and diverse methodologies, the journal played a pivotal role in shaping the field of cell biology, offering a platform for groundbreaking discoveries and fostering a deeper understanding of cellular mechanisms.
