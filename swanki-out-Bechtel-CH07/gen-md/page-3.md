## What were the main reasons behind the creation of the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology as discussed in the final chapter of the Journal of Cell Biology in 1964?

The main reasons behind the creation of the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology were:

1. **Emergence of Electron Microscopy**: The high resolution of electron micrographs produced by the early 1950s necessitated the capability to produce very high-quality plates, which only a few journals possessed.
2. **Quality Issues with Existing Journals**: The Anatomical Record, a major journal interested in morphological issues, lacked the ability and quality to produce sufficiently good plates.
3. **Rejection of Key Research**: Important papers like the identification of the $9+2$ structure of cilia by Porter and Fawcett (1953) were rejected by prominent journals such as the Journal of Experimental Medicine, triggering the need for a new journal.

## How did Porter contribute to the creation and early development of the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology?

Porter played a crucial role in the creation and early development of the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology. He was actively involved in writing and submitting papers that highlighted the importance of electron microscopy in cell structures. For instance, the paper with Don Fawcett identifying the $9+2$ structure of cilia was initially rejected by several prominent journals, prompting Porter to consider starting a new journal with higher quality standards for this kind of research.

## What were the limitations of the Anatomical Record and other existing journals that prompted the need for a new journal as highlighted in the final chapter of the Journal of Cell Biology in 1964?

The limitations of the Anatomical Record and other existing journals were:

1. **Inability to Produce High-Quality Plates**: The Anatomical Record lacked the capability to produce the high-quality plates required by the high-resolution electron micrographs.
2. **Publication Interest**: Existing journals like the Journal of Experimental Medicine and the Journal of General Physiology were not interested in publishing numerous electron micrographs, despite their scientific significance.
3. **Rejection of Important Research**: For example, the paper by Fawcett and Porter on the $9+2$ structure of cilia was rejected by these journals, indicating a lack of accommodation for research on morphological studies.

## What impact did the emergence of electron microscopy have on scientific publications in the mid-20th century?

The emergence of electron microscopy had a significant impact on scientific publications in the mid-20th century:

1. **Demand for High-Quality Plates**: The high resolution of electron micrographs necessitated the ability to print very high-quality plates, pushing some journals to upgrade or leading to the creation of new journals.
2. **Shift in Publication Standards**: Journals that couldnâ€™t meet the new standards either had to improve or risk losing important papers to new, more specialized journals.
3. **Creation of Specialized Journals**: The limitations and rejections from established journals led to the establishment of specialized journals, like the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology, tailored to accommodate high-quality electron micrography and associated research.
