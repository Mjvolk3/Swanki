## In the context of journal publication requirements for high-resolution electron micrographs, which journals are mentioned as capable of producing the necessary quality engravings, and what are their limitations?

The journals mentioned as capable of producing high-quality engravings are the Journal of Experimental Medicine and the Journal of Histochemistry in the USA, as well as Experimental Cell Research and Biochemica et Biophysica Acta. The limitations include their limited capacity to accommodate numerous cytological papers and the poor quality of half-tone engravings in journals like the Anatomical Record and the American Journal of Anatomy.

## According to Schmitt, what types of studies should the proposed new journal include, and what methods should be used for these studies?

The proposed new journal should include studies at the molecular or near-molecular level. These studies would use both direct methods (electron microscopy, UV, phase contrast, interference, and other microscopy types) and indirect methods (X-ray diffraction, polarization optics). Additionally, physical chemical investigations like ultracentrifuge, electrophoresis, light scattering, streaming birefringence, viscosity, and diffusion should be included for characterizing protoplasmic constituents.

## What was Schmitt's main concern about the new journal, and how did he suggest broadening its focus?

Schmitt was concerned that the new journal might be too focused on electron microscopy alone. He suggested that the journal should instead focus on a broader range of techniques, including both direct and indirect methods, as well as physical chemical investigations, to cover a wider array of biological studies at the molecular level.

## What did Schmitt argue was the ultimate aim of the studies to be published in the new journal?

Schmitt argued that the ultimate aim of the studies to be included in the new journal was the detailed characterization of protoplasmic constituents. This includes the shapes, sizes, and properties of biological macromolecules.
