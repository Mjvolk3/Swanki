## What was the primary rationale for reorganizing the Tissue Culture Association (TCA) into a society focused on cell biology? 

Harris observed that since tissue culture had become "a standard part of the experimental armamentarium," the need to promote it as a technique had declined. Instead, he suggested that reorganizing the TCA to focus on cell biology would be timely and useful.

\text{The proposal aimed to create "a society of cell biologists - cytologists, physiologists, biochemists, morphogeneticists, etc. - whose interests concern the cell."}

## When did the NIH Study Section for Cell Biology get established and why?
The NIH Study Section for Cell Biology was established in 1958 after splitting the earlier Study Section for Morphology and Genetics into two specific sections: one for genetics and another for cell biology. 

$$
\text{This happened to cater to the growing interest and specialization within these scientific fields.}

## What was the major proposal made by the Study Section for Cell Biology in 1958, and what was its outcome?

In 1958, the Study Section for Cell Biology proposed University Laboratories for Cell Biology to be decentralized on college campuses for better contact between scientific staff and students. 

$$
\text{This proposal was not well received by the NIH administration. Instead, they supported long-term funding of highly qualified groups of individuals.}

## What was Keith Porter's role in the establishment of the NIH Study Section for Cell Biology, and what was one of the key outcomes of his involvement?

Keith Porter was the chairman of the ad hoc group that prepared the initial draft for the establishment of University Laboratories for Cell Biology. 

$$
\text{Although the original proposal was not accepted, the Study Section eventually supported long-term funding programs, with successful grants such as the one given to the University of California, Berkeley.}
