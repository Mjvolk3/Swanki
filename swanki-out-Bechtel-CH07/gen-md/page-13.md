## Describe a challenge faced by cell biologists in establishing a new society and its interaction with existing societies.

One challenge faced by cell biologists in establishing a new society was the competition from other societies that recognized the cell as a prime area of focus. For instance, the Society of General Physiologists (SGP), created in 1946, had also begun to expand its focus to include cell biologists and geneticists. This created a scenario where existing societies vied for control over the emerging field of cell biology, complicating the efforts to establish a distinct society for cell biology.

## Explain the significance of the meeting held at Rockefeller Institute on January 9, 1960, for the establishment of a new cell biology society.

The meeting at the Rockefeller Institute on January 9, 1960, was significant because it gathered representatives from various constituencies interested in the field of cell biology. This included representatives from the TCA, the Cell Biology Study Section, the International Society for Cell Biology, and the Society of General Physiologists. The meeting culminated in a vote, where thirteen out of fifteen scientists supported creating a new society for cell biology, thus marking a pivotal step towards establishing the new society.

## Report and argument by McElroy and Hayashi at the Rockefeller Institute meeting regarding the formation of a new society.

At the Rockefeller Institute meeting, McElroy and Hayashi reported that the Society of General Physiologists (SGP) had rejected the proposal to become a society for cell biology. They argued that forming a new society dedicated to cell biology was necessary to meet the specialized needs of the field, which the SGP could not fulfill. Their report significantly influenced the decision to establish the new society for cell biology.

## Describe the proposed merger discussed by Morgan Harris with Dan Mazia and its outcome.

Morgan Harris proposed to Dan Mazia, who was then President of the Society of General Physiologists (SGP), to merge the TCA and the SGP into a Society for Cell Biology. However, this proposal was rejected by Mazia. The rejection of this merger highlighted the necessity for a separate society dedicated specifically to cell biology, leading to the eventual formation of a new society.
