## Describe the strategy implemented by the ASCB to manage paper submissions and ensure disciplinary diversity in the early years.

To manage paper submissions and ensure disciplinary diversity, the ASCB decided to limit the number of contributed paper slots starting from the 1963 meeting. This decision was influenced not just by the quality of paper submissions but also by the need to attract diverse disciplinary approaches, especially to attract biochemists and prevent the society from being identified with any single technique or discipline.

## What roles did David Green and Alex Novikoff play in the early ASCB, and what significance did their elections hold?

David Green, a biochemist, served as the program chair for the 1964 meeting, bringing a strong biochemical presence to the program. Alex Novikoff, another biochemist, served as president-elect in 1962-3 and was the society's second president. Their elections highlighted the society's intention to include biochemists in leadership roles to attract more biochemists as members.

## Explain the composition and focus of the invited symposia for the 1964 ASCB meeting under David Green's program chairmanship.

For the 1964 ASCB meeting, David Green organized the invited symposia into a three-part symposium focused on biological membranes. The first part of the symposium concentrated on three main topics: energized ion translocation in membrane systems, contractile proteins of membrane systems, and structural proteins.

## Who were the biochemists nominated for president-elect in 1963, and who won the election?

In 1963, following the recommendation of the council, the nominating committee nominated Van Potter and Harry Eagle for president-elect. Van Potter won the election to become the fourth president of the society.
