## Discuss the role of Palade in the editorial process of the journal as described in the paper chunk.

Palade, as a resident editor at Rockefeller, managed incoming manuscripts. He sent each manuscript to two editors for review. If the two editors agreed on the decision (publication or rejection), that decision was final. If they disagreed, a third editor or a specially chosen referee decided the outcome.

## What was the main concern Schmitt had with Porter's initial list of editors for the new journal?

Schmitt's main concern with Porter's initial list of editors was that it overemphasized descriptive morphology. He identified Bennett, Dempsey, Palade, and Porter as all representing this area and proposed alternative candidates.

## When the editors met with Bronk on 12 April 1954, what concerns did they have about the working name of the new journal?

The editors were concerned that the working name, "Journal of Cytology," conveyed too much focus on morphology and not enough on functional perspectives. To address this, they added the adjectives "biophysical" and "biochemical" to the title.

## What was the mission statement for the new journal, and how did it address Schmitt's concerns?

The mission statement for the new journal was to provide a common medium for presenting morphological, biochemical, and biophysical studies of cellular structure and function. Special attention was given to investigations at colloidal and molecular levels, addressing Schmitt's concerns for a broader focus beyond descriptive morphology.
