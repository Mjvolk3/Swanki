## What was a major concern for the new American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) in terms of its membership and its first scientific meeting?

A major concern for the new ASCB was how to ensure a diverse mix of specialties among its members in order not to be limited to morphology. The society aimed to include biochemists, biophysicists, cytologists, histologists, microbiologists, physiologists, and other scientists with a common interest in cells.

## What were the main topics of the symposia at the first meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) in 1961?

The main topics of the symposia at the first ASCB meeting in 1961 were:
1. Cell continuity
2. Cell diversification
3. Characters of cell interfaces

These topics were chosen to facilitate interdisciplinary communication among cell biologists.

## How did the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) ensure that most fields related to cell biology were well represented at the first meeting?

The ASCB used a comprehensive mailing list to recruit attendees and members. The list included biologists from various societies such as the American Society of Anatomists, American Society of Naturalists, American Society of Zoologists, and others. Initially, biochemical and biophysical societies were absent from the list but were later added to ensure a broad representation of related fields.

## What approach did the ASCB take to promote interdisciplinary communication at its first scientific meeting?

To promote interdisciplinary communication, the ASCB included invited symposia addressing broad topics like cell continuity, cell diversification, and the characters of cell interfaces. Additionally, the program committee accepted contributed papers without review, which helped in including diverse scientific contributions.
