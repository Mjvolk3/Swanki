## What was one of the main challenges faced by the organizers of the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology?

The main challenge was that despite including eminent figures such as Schmitt, Bear, and Davis on the board of editors to encourage submission of biophysically oriented papers, they failed to attract a significant number of such papers to the journal.

## How did the inclusion of figures like Green, Novikoff, and Siekevitz as officers and program chairs impact the participation of biochemists in the ASCB?

Despite including prominent figures such as Green, Novikoff, and Siekevitz as officers and program chairs, the ASCB failed to attract a significant number of biochemists to join or regularly attend meetings.

## What was one aspect where the new institutions, such as the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology and the ASCB, succeeded?

The new institutions succeeded in avoiding the narrow focus solely on morphological structure and established a new scientific domain where the structure and function of cell constituents were well-integrated. This success was attributed to the conscious attention and strategic efforts by the scientists who created these institutions.

## What constrained the efforts of cell biologists to position themselves in the new scientific domain?

The existence of other institutions dedicated to biochemistry and biophysics constrained the efforts of cell biologists to position themselves as desired in the new scientific domain.
