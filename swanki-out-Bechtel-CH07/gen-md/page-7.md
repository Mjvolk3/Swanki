## What significant problem did the editors of the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology face in its early years, and what steps did they take to address it?

The editors faced a significant problem in balancing the types of studies published. They observed an over-representation of morphological studies mainly derived from electron microscopy (E.M.), while papers with a biophysical and biochemical focus were in short supply. 

To address this, editors Bear and Lehninger agreed to give the issue their personal attention, and in subsequent years, there was a concerted effort to encourage submissions of biophysical and biochemical nature. By analyzing trends in manuscript contributions, they noted an increase in the diversity of papers, leading to a more balanced representation of research areas.

## Describe the trend in the types of manuscripts submitted to the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology by volume 4.

By early in volume 4, manuscripts primarily dependent on electron micrographic evidence exceeded others by 2 to 1. However, by the end of volume 4, this trend had shifted, with an equal number of non-E.M. manuscripts being submitted. Currently, only $\frac{2}{5}$ papers report solely E.M. evidence.

The efforts of the editors led contributors and readers to recognize the journal's interest in cell biology regardless of the method used, balancing the types of research represented.

$$
\text{By early volume 4: E.M. papers} > \text{non-E.M. papers by } 2:1
$$

$$
\text{End of volume 4: E.M. papers} = \text{non-E.M. papers}
$$

$$
\text{Current trend: only } \frac{2}{5} \text{ papers rely solely on E.M evidence}
$$

## What role did Schmitt and Porter play in addressing the imbalance of paper types in the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology, and what were their views on electron microscopy?

Schmitt acknowledged the dominance of descriptive morphological papers and agreed with Porter that increasing the number of biophysical and biochemical papers was necessary. Porter, despite his association with electron microscopy, also saw the need for a broader range of papers.

Schmitt and Porter actively worked to secure more biophysical and biochemical papers. Porter even welcomed a new editor with the remark that they needed more "biophysics" and fewer long descriptive E.M. manuscripts.

## What evidence was there that the efforts to diversify the journal's paper types were successful?

The analysis by Porter and Palade indicated a shift in the types of manuscripts submitted to the journal. Initially, electron micrographic papers outnumbered others by 2 to 1 in early volume 4; however, by the end of the same volume, this ratio became equal. The trend showed continued growth in non-E.M. papers, with currently only $\frac{2}{5}$ of papers reporting solely E.M. evidence.

This demonstrated that their contributors and readers began recognizing the journalâ€™s broader scope beyond just electron microscopy.

$$
\text{Initial: } \frac{\text{E.M. papers}}{\text{Non-E.M. papers}} = 2:1
$$

$$
\text{End of volume 4: E.M. papers} = \text{Non-E.M. papers}
$$

$$
\text{Current: } \frac{\text{E.M. papers}}{\text{Total papers}} = \frac{2}{5}
$$
