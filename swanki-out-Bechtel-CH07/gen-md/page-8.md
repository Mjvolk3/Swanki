## Why was Paul Doty selected as an editor of the journal over other candidates in 1958?

Paul Doty was selected because he was a biophysically oriented investigator. This specialization was aligned with the journal's goal of diversifying the types of manuscripts it attracted, particularly in domains beyond morphology.

## Describe the significance and contents of the first special supplemental issue of the journal and the role of external funding in its creation.

The first special supplemental issue, which appeared in September 1956, consisted of papers presented at the Conference on Tissue Fine Structure. It was part of the journal's strategy to improve its diversity of manuscripts and was supported by a $\$15,000$ grant from the United States Public Health Service. The supplement included papers centered around new translations of classical papers. For instance, Porter edited a supplement focused on muscle, organized around Emilio Veratti's 1901 paper "Investigations on the Fine Structure of Striated Muscle Fiber."

## How did the journal's editors maintain continuity when replacing retiring members, and what special role did Porter serve in this context?

When replacing retiring members, the journal's editors recommended replacements from the same research area to ensure broad research coverage. Specifically, Porter was chosen to retire but was retained because he was de facto the chief editor needed to provide continuity. Thus, maintaining intellectual leadership and stability of the journal was a priority.

## Discuss the planning and realization of the second special issue of the journal and its scientific focus.

The second special issue was edited by Daniel Mazia and focused on mitosis. It was built around Walther Flemming's 1880 paper "Beitr√§ge zur Kenntnis der Zelle und Ihrer Lebenserscheinungen." This special issue continued the journal's tradition of including translations of classic papers alongside contemporary research, demonstrating the journal's commitment to combining historical perspective with cutting-edge science.
