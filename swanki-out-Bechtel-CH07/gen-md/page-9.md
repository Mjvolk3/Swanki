## In a 1960 report, what did Porter and Palade suggest concerning the name of the journal and its scope?

Porter and Palade raised the question of dropping "biophysical" and "biochemical" from the journal name.

They suggested that changing the name might better describe the journal's content and address the problem of scope. They noted the existence of other journals like the Journal of Biophysics and the Journal of Molecular Biology which could potentially publish manuscripts relevant to those disciplines.

## Provide two reasons Palade gave for opposing the name change of the journal in his letter to Porter.

Palade offered the following reasons for keeping the name:

1. The journal had already obtained a positive reputation with its current name.
2. The adjectives "biophysical" and "biochemical" characterize the trend in the field.

He also argued that changing the name to "cell biology" would represent a more conservative shift focused on cell structure and physiology in the traditional sense.

## What alternative name did Palade propose for the journal in his letter to Porter?

Palade proposed the alternative name "Cellular and Subcellular Biology" for the journal.

He suggested this name because he believed it captured the broader scope and trend in the field, given that cell biology alone was seen as more conservative and centered on cell structure and physiology.

## What was the initial rationale for naming the journal with "biophysical" and "biochemical" inclusions according to Porter?

The initial rationale for including "biophysical" and "biochemical" in the journal's name was to discourage a predicted flood of papers on pure morphology.

Porter noted that this compromise name, insisted upon by a few founding editors, was meant to reflect the broader scope and interdisciplinary nature of the journal.
