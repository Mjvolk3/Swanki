## What were the key focuses of the three-part symposium organized by Lee Peachey?

The three-part symposium organized by Lee Peachey focused on:
1. Physical and physical-chemical aspects (e.g. electron and proton mobility, movement of functional groups, and molecular movement, including conformational changes and movement of molecules)
2. Translocation of ions and small molecules (e.g. ionic movement in mitochondria and other membrane systems)
3. Recent progress on biological movement (e.g. chromosome movement, spindle fibers, flagella, cilia)

## According to the document, how did biochemists respond to the institutionalization of cell biology over time?

In response to the institutionalization of cell biology:
- Cell biologists incorporated important biochemical tools into their practice of cell biology.
- Biochemists already had their own institutions and journals and became primary users of cell fractionation techniques adopted from early cell biology.
- The concern with reaching out to biochemists declined over time because biochemists had their primary institutional base and cell biologists adapted necessary biochemistry tools.

## What was the primary goal of Green's interest in particles isolated from the mitochondrial membrane?

Green's primary goal was to understand the mechanisms of electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation by studying particles isolated from the mitochondrial membrane. This was a focus of the second part of Green's membrane systems symposium.

## Who were the biochemists who often disagreed with Green on the interpretation of mitochondrial particles he had isolated?

Britton Chance and Elfraim Racker were the biochemists who often differed with Green on the interpretation of the particles he had isolated from the mitochondrial membrane.
