## What was the primary initial focus and contention regarding the creation of the Journal of Cytology proposed by Porter?

From the outset, the focus of the journal was a point of contention. Porter's primary interest was electron microscopy and so a major objective for him was creating a journal able to reproduce electron micrographs with high enough quality.

## How did Bronk characterize the new Journal of Cytology, and what investigative methods did he emphasize?

Bronk's proposal characterized the new journal to deal with cytology from the perspectives of anatomists, histologists, physiologists, biochemists, and especially histochemists. It aimed to focus on new physical and chemical methods for investigating the submicroscopic molecular structure of cells, such as the electron microscope and X-ray diffraction methods.

## Who were the key figures involved in discussing and proposing the establishment of the Journal of Cytology, and what roles did they play?

Key figures involved in discussing and proposing the establishment of the Journal of Cytology included Bronk, who made the proposal, H. Stanley Bennett, and Francis O. Schmitt. Porter was also a driving force behind the idea due to his interest in electron microscopy.

## Describe the nature of the debate around the "new journal" proposed by Sjöstrand and Porter's reaction to it.

Porter was not kind to Sjöstrand's proposal for a new journal focusing on fine structure, which eventually led to the creation of The Journal of Ultrastructure Research in 1957. Porter opposed the idea and expressed his dissatisfaction in a letter, stating that if anyone had strong feelings against it, they should communicate them to Mr. Jacoby at Academic.
