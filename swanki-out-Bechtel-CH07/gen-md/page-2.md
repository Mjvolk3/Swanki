## How did Palade, Porter, and Sjöstrand contribute to the development of cell biology research styles in their respective institutions?

Palade and Porter, at the Rockefeller Institute, and Sjöstrand, at the Karolinska Institute, developed two different styles of research in cell biology. Their approaches helped shape the emerging field by performing, presenting, and publishing groundbreaking research, as well as helping to establish new journals and societies. For example, Sjöstrand established *the Journal of Ultrastructure Research* in 1957.
