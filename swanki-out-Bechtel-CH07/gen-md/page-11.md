## What were the main motivations behind renaming the Journal to the Journal of Cell Biology according to Porter's letter?

Porter's 23 June 1961 letter highlighted two main motivations for renaming the journal to the Journal of Cell Biology:
1. To align with the emerging American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB).
2. To prevent another organization from starting a journal with the same aims and name.

These reasons were based on the strategic benefit of having the ASCB as a co-sponsor, which would guarantee the journal's longevity.
