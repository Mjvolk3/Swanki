## What institutional elements are essential for the establishment of a new scientific field such as cell biology?

Key institutional elements include journals and professional societies. These institutions not only disseminate scientific work and confer recognition upon researchers, but also delineate the problems and methods deemed significant and acceptable within the scientific community. For cell biology, such institutions were crucial in forging an identity distinct from classical cytology and facilitating its integration among established scientific disciplines.

- #academia, #scientific-institutions.journals, #scientific-institutions.professional-societies

## Explain the dichotomy between classical cytology and the newly emerging field of cell biology in the 1960s.

Classical cytology primarily focused on the morphological aspects of cells, while the emerging field of cell biology sought to integrate both structural and functional information about the cell. By incorporating insights from various other disciplines, cell biology aimed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of cellular processes and mechanisms, distinguishing itself from classical cytology.

- #journal-of-cell-biology.technical-approaches, #biophysics.cell-biology

## What were the main motivations behind renaming the Journal to the Journal of Cell Biology according to Porter's letter?

Porter's 23 June 1961 letter highlighted two main motivations for renaming the journal to the Journal of Cell Biology:
1. To align with the emerging American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB).
2. To prevent another organization from starting a journal with the same aims and name.

These reasons were based on the strategic benefit of having the ASCB as a co-sponsor, which would guarantee the journal's longevity.

## Describe a challenge faced by cell biologists in establishing a new society and its interaction with existing societies.

One challenge faced by cell biologists in establishing a new society was the competition from other societies that recognized the cell as a prime area of focus. For instance, the Society of General Physiologists (SGP), created in 1946, had also begun to expand its focus to include cell biologists and geneticists. This created a scenario where existing societies vied for control over the emerging field of cell biology, complicating the efforts to establish a distinct society for cell biology.

### Card 1

## What were the main reasons behind the creation of the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology as discussed in the final chapter of the Journal of Cell Biology in 1964?

The main reasons behind the creation of the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology were:

1. **Emergence of Electron Microscopy**: The high resolution of electron micrographs produced by the early 1950s necessitated the capability to produce very high-quality plates, which only a few journals possessed.
2. **Quality Issues with Existing Journals**: The Anatomical Record, a major journal interested in morphological issues, lacked the ability and quality to produce sufficiently good plates.
3. **Rejection of Key Research**: Important papers like the identification of the $9+2$ structure of cilia by Porter and Fawcett (1953) were rejected by prominent journals such as the Journal of Experimental Medicine, triggering the need for a new journal.

- #scientific-history, #publications.journals

---

### Card 2

## How did Porter contribute to the creation and early development of the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology?

Porter played a crucial role in the creation and early development of the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology. He was actively involved in writing and submitting papers that highlighted the importance of electron microscopy in cell structures. For instance, the paper with Don Fawcett identifying the $9+2$ structure of cilia was initially rejected by several prominent journals, prompting Porter to consider starting a new journal with higher quality standards for this kind of research.

### Card 3

## What were the limitations of the Anatomical Record and other existing journals that prompted the need for a new journal as highlighted in the final chapter of the Journal of Cell Biology in 1964?

The limitations of the Anatomical Record and other existing journals were:

1. **Inability to Produce High-Quality Plates**: The Anatomical Record lacked the capability to produce the high-quality plates required by the high-resolution electron micrographs.
2. **Publication Interest**: Existing journals like the Journal of Experimental Medicine and the Journal of General Physiology were not interested in publishing numerous electron micrographs, despite their scientific significance.
3. **Rejection of Important Research**: For example, the paper by Fawcett and Porter on the $9+2$ structure of cilia was rejected by these journals, indicating a lack of accommodation for research on morphological studies.

- #scientific-history, #publications.limitations

---

### Card 4

## What impact did the emergence of electron microscopy have on scientific publications in the mid-20th century?

The emergence of electron microscopy had a significant impact on scientific publications in the mid-20th century:

1. **Demand for High-Quality Plates**: The high resolution of electron micrographs necessitated the ability to print very high-quality plates, pushing some journals to upgrade or leading to the creation of new journals.
2. **Shift in Publication Standards**: Journals that couldn’t meet the new standards either had to improve or risk losing important papers to new, more specialized journals.
3. **Creation of Specialized Journals**: The limitations and rejections from established journals led to the establishment of specialized journals, like the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology, tailored to accommodate high-quality electron micrography and associated research.

- #scientific-history, #technology.impact

## What was the primary initial focus and contention regarding the creation of the Journal of Cytology proposed by Porter?

From the outset, the focus of the journal was a point of contention. Porter's primary interest was electron microscopy and so a major objective for him was creating a journal able to reproduce electron micrographs with high enough quality.

- #scientific-publishing, #history.cyotology, #electron-microscopy 

## How did Bronk characterize the new Journal of Cytology, and what investigative methods did he emphasize?

Bronk's proposal characterized the new journal to deal with cytology from the perspectives of anatomists, histologists, physiologists, biochemists, and especially histochemists. It aimed to focus on new physical and chemical methods for investigating the submicroscopic molecular structure of cells, such as the electron microscope and X-ray diffraction methods.

- #scientific-publishing, #history.cyotology, #investigative-methods

## Who were the key figures involved in discussing and proposing the establishment of the Journal of Cytology, and what roles did they play?

Key figures involved in discussing and proposing the establishment of the Journal of Cytology included Bronk, who made the proposal, H. Stanley Bennett, and Francis O. Schmitt. Porter was also a driving force behind the idea due to his interest in electron microscopy.

- #scientific-publishing, #history.cyotology, #key-figures

## Describe the nature of the debate around the "new journal" proposed by Sjöstrand and Porter's reaction to it.

Porter was not kind to Sjöstrand's proposal for a new journal focusing on fine structure, which eventually led to the creation of The Journal of Ultrastructure Research in 1957. Porter opposed the idea and expressed his dissatisfaction in a letter, stating that if anyone had strong feelings against it, they should communicate them to Mr. Jacoby at Academic.

- #scientific-publishing, #history.cyotology, #academic-disputes

## In the context of journal publication requirements for high-resolution electron micrographs, which journals are mentioned as capable of producing the necessary quality engravings, and what are their limitations?

The journals mentioned as capable of producing high-quality engravings are the Journal of Experimental Medicine and the Journal of Histochemistry in the USA, as well as Experimental Cell Research and Biochemica et Biophysica Acta. The limitations include their limited capacity to accommodate numerous cytological papers and the poor quality of half-tone engravings in journals like the Anatomical Record and the American Journal of Anatomy.

- #publication, #electron-micrographs, #journal-limitations

## According to Schmitt, what types of studies should the proposed new journal include, and what methods should be used for these studies?

The proposed new journal should include studies at the molecular or near-molecular level. These studies would use both direct methods (electron microscopy, UV, phase contrast, interference, and other microscopy types) and indirect methods (X-ray diffraction, polarization optics). Additionally, physical chemical investigations like ultracentrifuge, electrophoresis, light scattering, streaming birefringence, viscosity, and diffusion should be included for characterizing protoplasmic constituents.

- #publication, #scientific-study, #electron-microscopy

## What was Schmitt's main concern about the new journal, and how did he suggest broadening its focus?

Schmitt was concerned that the new journal might be too focused on electron microscopy alone. He suggested that the journal should instead focus on a broader range of techniques, including both direct and indirect methods, as well as physical chemical investigations, to cover a wider array of biological studies at the molecular level.

- #publication, #journal-focus, #scientific-techniques

## What did Schmitt argue was the ultimate aim of the studies to be published in the new journal?

Schmitt argued that the ultimate aim of the studies to be included in the new journal was the detailed characterization of protoplasmic constituents. This includes the shapes, sizes, and properties of biological macromolecules.

- #publication, #scientific-aims, #protoplasmic-characterization

## Discuss the role of Palade in the editorial process of the journal as described in the paper chunk.

Palade, as a resident editor at Rockefeller, managed incoming manuscripts. He sent each manuscript to two editors for review. If the two editors agreed on the decision (publication or rejection), that decision was final. If they disagreed, a third editor or a specially chosen referee decided the outcome.

- #science-editing.process, #science-journal.roles

## What was the main concern Schmitt had with Porter's initial list of editors for the new journal?

Schmitt's main concern with Porter's initial list of editors was that it overemphasized descriptive morphology. He identified Bennett, Dempsey, Palade, and Porter as all representing this area and proposed alternative candidates.

- #science-editing.process, #science-journal.roles

## When the editors met with Bronk on 12 April 1954, what concerns did they have about the working name of the new journal?

The editors were concerned that the working name, "Journal of Cytology," conveyed too much focus on morphology and not enough on functional perspectives. To address this, they added the adjectives "biophysical" and "biochemical" to the title.

- #science-journal.naming, #science-disciplinary-balance

## What was the mission statement for the new journal, and how did it address Schmitt's concerns?

The mission statement for the new journal was to provide a common medium for presenting morphological, biochemical, and biophysical studies of cellular structure and function. Special attention was given to investigations at colloidal and molecular levels, addressing Schmitt's concerns for a broader focus beyond descriptive morphology.

- #science-mission.statement, #science-disciplinary-balance

## What significant problem did the editors of the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology face in its early years, and what steps did they take to address it?

The editors faced a significant problem in balancing the types of studies published. They observed an over-representation of morphological studies mainly derived from electron microscopy (E.M.), while papers with a biophysical and biochemical focus were in short supply. 

To address this, editors Bear and Lehninger agreed to give the issue their personal attention, and in subsequent years, there was a concerted effort to encourage submissions of biophysical and biochemical nature. By analyzing trends in manuscript contributions, they noted an increase in the diversity of papers, leading to a more balanced representation of research areas.

- #journals, #biophysics-biochemistry, #electron-microscopy

## Describe the trend in the types of manuscripts submitted to the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology by volume 4.

By early in volume 4, manuscripts primarily dependent on electron micrographic evidence exceeded others by 2 to 1. However, by the end of volume 4, this trend had shifted, with an equal number of non-E.M. manuscripts being submitted. Currently, only $\frac{2}{5}$ papers report solely E.M. evidence.

The efforts of the editors led contributors and readers to recognize the journal's interest in cell biology regardless of the method used, balancing the types of research represented.

$$
\text{By early volume 4: E.M. papers} > \text{non-E.M. papers by } 2:1
$$

$$
\text{End of volume 4: E.M. papers} = \text{non-E.M. papers}
$$

$$
\text{Current trend: only } \frac{2}{5} \text{ papers rely solely on E.M evidence}
$$

- #trends, #manuscript-submission, #journal-balance

## What role did Schmitt and Porter play in addressing the imbalance of paper types in the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology, and what were their views on electron microscopy?

Schmitt acknowledged the dominance of descriptive morphological papers and agreed with Porter that increasing the number of biophysical and biochemical papers was necessary. Porter, despite his association with electron microscopy, also saw the need for a broader range of papers.

Schmitt and Porter actively worked to secure more biophysical and biochemical papers. Porter even welcomed a new editor with the remark that they needed more "biophysics" and fewer long descriptive E.M. manuscripts.

- #editorial-roles, #paper-balance, #biophysics-vs-EM

## What evidence was there that the efforts to diversify the journal's paper types were successful?

The analysis by Porter and Palade indicated a shift in the types of manuscripts submitted to the journal. Initially, electron micrographic papers outnumbered others by 2 to 1 in early volume 4; however, by the end of the same volume, this ratio became equal. The trend showed continued growth in non-E.M. papers, with currently only $\frac{2}{5}$ of papers reporting solely E.M. evidence.

This demonstrated that their contributors and readers began recognizing the journal’s broader scope beyond just electron microscopy.

$$
\text{Initial: } \frac{\text{E.M. papers}}{\text{Non-E.M. papers}} = 2:1
$$

$$
\text{End of volume 4: E.M. papers} = \text{Non-E.M. papers}
$$

$$
\text{Current: } \frac{\text{E.M. papers}}{\text{Total papers}} = \frac{2}{5}
$$

## Why was Paul Doty selected as an editor of the journal over other candidates in 1958?

Paul Doty was selected because he was a biophysically oriented investigator. This specialization was aligned with the journal's goal of diversifying the types of manuscripts it attracted, particularly in domains beyond morphology.

## Describe the significance and contents of the first special supplemental issue of the journal and the role of external funding in its creation.

The first special supplemental issue, which appeared in September 1956, consisted of papers presented at the Conference on Tissue Fine Structure. It was part of the journal's strategy to improve its diversity of manuscripts and was supported by a $\$15,000$ grant from the United States Public Health Service. The supplement included papers centered around new translations of classical papers. For instance, Porter edited a supplement focused on muscle, organized around Emilio Veratti's 1901 paper "Investigations on the Fine Structure of Striated Muscle Fiber."

## How did the journal's editors maintain continuity when replacing retiring members, and what special role did Porter serve in this context?

When replacing retiring members, the journal's editors recommended replacements from the same research area to ensure broad research coverage. Specifically, Porter was chosen to retire but was retained because he was de facto the chief editor needed to provide continuity. Thus, maintaining intellectual leadership and stability of the journal was a priority.

## Discuss the planning and realization of the second special issue of the journal and its scientific focus.

The second special issue was edited by Daniel Mazia and focused on mitosis. It was built around Walther Flemming's 1880 paper "Beiträge zur Kenntnis der Zelle und Ihrer Lebenserscheinungen." This special issue continued the journal's tradition of including translations of classic papers alongside contemporary research, demonstrating the journal's commitment to combining historical perspective with cutting-edge science.

## In a 1960 report, what did Porter and Palade suggest concerning the name of the journal and its scope?

Porter and Palade raised the question of dropping "biophysical" and "biochemical" from the journal name.

They suggested that changing the name might better describe the journal's content and address the problem of scope. They noted the existence of other journals like the Journal of Biophysics and the Journal of Molecular Biology which could potentially publish manuscripts relevant to those disciplines.

## Provide two reasons Palade gave for opposing the name change of the journal in his letter to Porter.

Palade offered the following reasons for keeping the name:

1. The journal had already obtained a positive reputation with its current name.
2. The adjectives "biophysical" and "biochemical" characterize the trend in the field.

He also argued that changing the name to "cell biology" would represent a more conservative shift focused on cell structure and physiology in the traditional sense.

## What alternative name did Palade propose for the journal in his letter to Porter?

Palade proposed the alternative name "Cellular and Subcellular Biology" for the journal.

He suggested this name because he believed it captured the broader scope and trend in the field, given that cell biology alone was seen as more conservative and centered on cell structure and physiology.

## What was the initial rationale for naming the journal with "biophysical" and "biochemical" inclusions according to Porter?

The initial rationale for including "biophysical" and "biochemical" in the journal's name was to discourage a predicted flood of papers on pure morphology.

Porter noted that this compromise name, insisted upon by a few founding editors, was meant to reflect the broader scope and interdisciplinary nature of the journal.
