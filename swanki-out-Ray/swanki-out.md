### Card 2

The mass flux of water vapor through the pores in the SWME is calculated using which type of diffusion?

%
The mass flux of water vapor through the pores in the SWME is calculated using Knudsen diffusion. Knudsen diffusion is relevant when the mean free path of the molecules is comparable to the size of the pores in the membrane.

$$
J = \frac{\epsilon}{\tau} \cdot \frac{D_k}{\delta} \cdot (p_1 - p_2)
$$

where:
- $J$ = mass flux of water vapor
- $\epsilon$ = porosity
- $\tau$ = tortuosity
- $D_k$ = Knudsen diffusion coefficient
- $\delta$ = membrane thickness
- $p_1, p_2$ = pressures at different points

### Card 3

What equation is used to estimate the lumen side pressure drop in the SWME, and what are the main variables involved?

%
The lumen side pressure drop in the SWME is estimated using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:

$$
\Delta P = \frac{8 \mu L Q}{\pi r^4}
$$

where:
- $\Delta P$ = pressure drop
- $\mu$ = dynamic viscosity of the fluid
- $L$ = length of the tube
- $Q$ = volumetric flow rate
- $r$ = radius of the tube

This equation assumes laminar flow conditions within the lumen side of the hollow fiber membrane.

### Card 4

What is the primary operational difference between Vacuum Membrane Distillation (VMD) and the SWME?

%
The primary operational difference between Vacuum Membrane Distillation (VMD) and the SWME is their objective with respect to heat loss and evaporation:

- **VMD** seeks to minimize heat loss due to evaporation while producing a high-quality distillate.
- **SWME** seeks to maximize heat loss through evaporation for the purpose of cooling the water in the lumen side, rather than producing a specific quality of distillate.

- #vmd, #swme, #thermal-management


### Card 5

What role does a backpressure valve play in the operation of the SWME?

%
In the operation of the SWME, a backpressure valve is used to control the water vapor pressure in the shell of the hollow fiber module. This helps in:

- Regulating the rate of water evaporation
- Controlling the exiting temperature of the liquid water

By adjusting the backpressure valve, the system can manage the thermal control effectively to ensure the astronauts' comfort and safety.

### Card 6

Explain how the Nusselt correlation is utilized in the context of the SWME to calculate convective heat transfer coefficients.

%
The Nusselt correlation is used to calculate convective heat transfer coefficients on the lumen side of the hollow fiber in the SWME. For laminar flow conditions, the Nusselt number ($Nu$) can be related to the convective heat transfer coefficient ($h$) as follows:

$$
Nu = \frac{hD}{k}
$$

where:
- $Nu$ = Nusselt number
- $h$ = convective heat transfer coefficient
- $D$ = characteristic length (e.g., diameter of the lumen)
- $k$ = thermal conductivity of the fluid

The Nusselt number for laminar flow in circular tubes can be approximated by various empirical correlations, such as:

$$
Nu = 3.66
$$

for constant wall temperature. This allows for the calculation of $h$ which is critical for determining overall heat rejection in SWME.

## What effect does water intrusion have on thermal performance in polypropylene hollow fiber membranes?

Water intrusion reduces thermal performance due to the introduction of a stagnant liquid layer, which increases thermal resistance at the interface between the liquid and vapor. Although there can be an increase in vapor flux due to reduced vapor path length, the net effect is minimal. The introduction of water also affects the liquid entry pressure (LEP) which can lead to system failure if too high.

### Card 2

## Explain how the liquid entry pressure (LEP) is calculated using the Laplace-Young equation. Include the relevant variables and their relationships.

The liquid entry pressure (LEP) can be calculated using the Laplace-Young equation:

$$
\mathrm{LEP} = \frac{4 \gamma \cos(\theta)}{d}
$$

where:
- $\gamma$ is the water surface tension,
- $\theta$ is the contact angle between the liquid and the surface,
- $d$ is the average pore diameter.

For non-cylindrical pores, a geometric factor $\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{g}}$ (typically 0.4-0.6) is included, modifying the equation to:

$$
\mathrm{LEP} = \frac{4 \gamma \mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{g}} \cos(\theta)}{d}
$$

## What are the consequences of liquid entry into the pores of a membrane?

Liquid entry into the pores of a membrane can lead to:
1. Increased thermal resistance due to a stagnant liquid layer.
2. Reduced vapor path length, potentially increasing vapor flux.
3. Changes in interface temperature impacting water vapor pressure.
4. Critical system failure if LEP exceeds 1 bar, leading to significant water entry and heat rejection issues.

- #chemistry, #membrane-science.liquid-entry

### Card 4

## Derive the relationship for liquid entry pressure (LEP) considering non-cylindrical pores with a geometric factor.

For non-cylindrical pores, the geometric factor $\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{g}}$ becomes necessary in modifying the Laplace-Young equation.

$$
\mathrm{LEP} = \frac{4 \gamma \cos(\theta)}{d}
$$

Including the geometric factor:

$$
\mathrm{LEP} = \frac{4 \gamma \mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{g}} \cos(\theta)}{d}
$$

Here,
- $\gamma$ is the surface tension,
- $\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{g}}$ is the geometric factor (0.4-0.6 for non-cylindrical pores),
- $\theta$ is the contact angle,
- $d$ is the average pore diameter.

Deriving this relationship ensures that the measured pressure corresponds to the true pore geometry in non-cylindrical contexts.

2. Lowering the Liquid Entry Pressure (LEP), leading to easier intrusion of water.
3. Decreasing vapor pressure, which affects the driving force for evaporation, reducing thermal performance.

For example, a 1 mM SDS (288 ppm) reduces surface tension by 3%, while 2 mM SDS (576 ppm) reduces it by 9-10%.

Provide the equation for liquid entry pressure (LEP) using membrane and liquid properties.

### Back
The liquid entry pressure (LEP) is given by the Laplace equation:

$$
LEP = -\frac{4 B_{g} \gamma_{L} \cos \theta_{o}}{d_{P}}
$$

where:

- #membrane-science, #liquid-entry-pressure, #fluid-properties

### Card 1

Modeling vapor transport through the membrane pores requires consideration of Knudsen diffusion. 

## What equation is used to estimate vapor mass flux, assuming Knudsen diffusion?

The vapor mass flux is estimated using the Knudsen diffusion equation:

$$
J_K = \frac{2}{3} \frac{d_p \varphi_p}{\delta \tau} \left( \frac{\pi}{8 R T} \right)^{1/2} \left( P_1 - P_2 \right)
$$

where:
- $J_K$: Knudsen flux
- $d_p$: pore diameter
- $\varphi_p$: porosity
- $ \delta$: thickness
- $\tau$: tortuosity
- $R$: universal gas constant
- $T$: temperature
- $P_1$, $P_2$: partial pressures
  
- #diffusion, #membranes.knudsen

### Card 2

One key property for vapor transport in membranes is the overall membrane structure parameter, denoted $S_{P}$.

## What is the expression for the overall membrane structure parameter $S_{P}$?

The overall membrane structure parameter is given by:

$$
S_{P} = \frac{d_p \varphi_p}{\delta \tau}
$$

where:
- $d_p$: pore diameter
- $\varphi_p$: porosity
- $\delta$: membrane thickness
- $\tau$: tortuosity

By lumping these parameters together, it simplifies the flux equation.

- #membranes.structure_parameter

### Card 3

Model validation can be performed by comparing experimental data to modeled predictions.

## What $S_{P}$ value was found to best fit the experimental data and what $\mathrm{R}^{2}$ value does it produce?

The value of $S_{P}$ that best fits the experimental data is:

$$
S_{P} = 1.04 \times 10^{-4}
$$

with an $\mathrm{R}^2$ value of:

$$
0.9965
$$

This suggests a very good fit between the model predictions and the experimental data.

- #modeling, #membranes.performance

### Card 4

Validation of the model involves comparison with real membrane properties and experimental outcomes.

## For the formula $S_{P} = 1.04 \times 10^{-4}$, which measured values of $d_p$, $\varphi_p$, and $\delta$ were substituted, and what are the resulting $\tau$ values?

Using:
- $d_p = 42 \, \mathrm{nm}$ (shell surface) and $46 \, \mathrm{nm}$ (lumen surface)
- $\varphi_p = 24\%$ (measured by nitrogen adsorption)
- $\delta = 40 \, \mu \mathrm{m}$ 

The resulting $\tau$ values are:
- $\tau = 2.44$ for shell surface
- $\tau = 2.67$ for lumen surface

These values provide close approximation to the previously reported tortuosity for polypropylene membrane hollow fibers.

- #membranes.characteristics, #modeling.validation

### Card 5

The model predicts variations in temperatures under different conditions.

## For a shell side pressure of 0.5 torr and $S_{P}=4.0 \times 10^{-4}$, what is the significant result seen halfway down the fiber length?

At halfway down the fiber length, the significant result is:

$$
T \approx 0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

This is a critical observation as the temperature drops rapidly due to water vapor flux. For $S_{P}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}$, temperatures remain above zero, avoiding ice formation which is crucial for SWME applications.

- #temperature, #pressure.effects

### Card 6

Model predictions can vary with changes in structural parameters and operational conditions.

## For a shell side pressure of 7 torr and $S_{P}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}$, what is the outlet water temperature?

For a shell side pressure of 7 torr:

$$
T_{\text{outlet}} = 12.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

This represents a balance between efficient vapor flux and maintaining a temperature that avoids freezing, which aligns with the operational requirements.

In Fig. 5c, lower shell side pressure results in the outlet temperature approaching $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for higher values of $\mathrm{S_p}$, indicating significant cooling. This shows that optimal shell side pressure and $\mathrm{S_p}$ values must be balanced to attain desired outlet temperatures.

Here are six cards focusing on the scientific and mathematical concepts discussed in the provided chunk of the paper:

---

## How does the inlet water temperature affect heat rejection and the mass of water vaporized in a SWME module?

Increasing the inlet water temperature increases both heat rejection and the mass of water vaporized due to the increased driving force for vapor flux.

- #thermodynamics, #engineering.swme

---

## What is the effect of inlet water temperature on outlet water temperature for a high membrane structure parameter $S_{P}$?

For high values of $S_{P}\left(=6 \times 10^{-4}\right)$, the effect on outlet water temperature is minimal. The outlet temperature never decreases below $6{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, where the vapor pressure of water is 7 torr.

- #thermodynamics, #engineering.swme

---

## Explain the pressure condition at which inlet temperatures below $6{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ will not produce any cooling in the SWME module.

For $\mathrm{P}_{\text {shell }}=7$ torr (atmospheric pressure on Mars), inlet temperatures below $6{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ will not produce any cooling because the minimum vapor pressure at this temperature is 7 torr.

- #pressure-conditions, #engineering.swme

---

## What is the nominal heat load for a spacewalk and how does it relate to the SWME module's performance?

The nominal heat load for a spacewalk is around $350 \mathrm{~W}$. The SWME module must handle this heat load to maintain the desired outlet water temperature, which is typically around $10{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

- #thermodynamics, #heat-loads

---

## Describe the algebraic approximation for predicting heat rejection and temperature drop in the SWME module.

The algebraic solution approximates the comprehensive mathematical model by considering physical properties as constant at an average temperature between the inlet and outlet.

$$
T_{\text {avg}} = \frac{T_{\text {in }} + T_{\text {out }}}{2}
$$

This simplifies the equations, but the approximation has greater error at higher inlet temperatures and membrane structure parameters.

- #mathematical-approximations, #engineering.swme

## Using the contour plots from the study, how can one choose the appropriate combination of inlet water temperature, $S_{P}$, and $P_{\text {shell}}$ for a targeted outlet water temperature?

The contour plots allow for the selection of a combination of inlet water temperature, membrane structure parameter $S_{P}$, and shell pressure $P_{\text {shell}}$ to achieve a targeted outlet water temperature (e.g., $10{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$).

### Card 1

## Explain the relationship between membrane structure parameter (SP) and heat rejection in the SWME process.

The heat rejection in the SWME process increases with increasing membrane structure parameter, denoted as $SP$. However, it should be noted that the algebraic model tends to overpredict the values for high $SP$. Specifically, the error in predicting outlet temperature rises with an increase in inlet temperature.

### Card 3

## How does fouling by scaling or particulate deposition affect membrane distillation performance?

Fouling by scaling or particulate deposition significantly degrades performance by:

- Scaling e.g., $\text{CaCO}_3$ deposits
- Reducing water flux

### Card 4

## Describe the relationship between inlet water temperature and error in the SWME model's temperature predictions.

The model prediction error, especially in outlet temperature prediction, increases with higher inlet water temperatures. The predicted outlet temperature difference $(T_{\text{out ODE}} - T_{\text{out algebraic}})/T_{\text{out ODE}}$, for example, remains less than 10% only for inlet temperatures below $8{ }^{\circ}C$.

### Card 5

## Discuss the effect of reducing pore size on heat rejection in the SWME process.

Reducing the pore size by a factor of two leads to a substantial decrease in heat rejection for the range of inlet temperatures considered. The reduction in heat flux (heat flux ratio) is approximately linear with inlet temperature.

### Card 6

## Explain what happens to thermal performance and system stability when $S_{p}$ is altered by $\pm 5\%$ due to fouling or pore size reduction.

A change of $\pm 5\%$ in $S_{p}$ can cause a $\pm 3\%$ change in the temperature drop of the SWME module. If the pore diameter is primarily reduced without blocking, $S_{p}$ decreases linearly. However, simultaneous blockages in small pores and porosity reduction can cause complex impacts:

- A $10\%$ reduction in pore diameter decreases surface porosity by $19\%$ and reduces $S_{p}$ by $27\%$.
- If small pores are blocked completely, only the porosity $\varphi_P$ reduces, impacting $S_{p}$ linearly with respect to porosity.

Explain the impact of inlet water temperature on the heat rejection and outlet water temperature in the SWME module based on the presented models.

%

Based on the provided image, the impact of inlet water temperature is as follows:
- **Heat Rejection (Plot a)**: As the inlet water temperature increases from about 5°C to 35°C, both models predict higher heat rejection. The algebraic model shows a slight overestimation compared to the ODE model.
- **Outlet Water Temperature (Plot b)**: With rising inlet water temperature, the outlet water temperature also increases according to both models. The algebraic model consistently overpredicts this temperature compared to the ODE model.

These observations suggest that inlet water temperature significantly influences the thermal performance of the SWME module, with the algebraic model tending to overestimate the outcomes.

What is the effect of reducing the pore size by half on heat rejection in an SWME system as a function of inlet water temperature?

%

Reducing the pore size by half significantly decreases the heat rejection across various inlet water temperatures in the SWME system. This is evident in the first graph where the heat rejection values are consistently lower for the "Half pore diameter" compared to the "Regular pore size." The reduction is more pronounced at higher inlet temperatures (up to about 2000 watts for regular pore size).

## Heat rejection as a function of pore size and inlet water temperature in SWME

How does the heat rejection in a Seawater Membrane Evaporator (SWME) system change when the pore size is reduced by half compared to the regular pore size?

%

When the pore size is reduced by half, the heat rejection in the SWME system decreases significantly compared to the regular pore size. This effect is due to the increased resistance to vapor flow through the smaller pores, which limits the system's ability to reject heat efficiently. The ratio of heat rejection for the halved pore size versus the regular pore size demonstrates this decline quantitatively. The conditions for the system are given by $\mathrm{P}_{\text {shell }}=7$ torr and $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{P}}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}$.

## Liquid Entry Pressure (LEP) variation with pore diameter and contact angle in SWME membranes

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_27_384e9aa440e500e82be9g-1.jpg?height=1574&width=1236&top_left_y=892&top_left_x=421)

Explain how the contact angle and average pore diameter affect the Liquid Entry Pressure (LEP) for a membrane at various water surface tensions.

%

The LEP is influenced both by the contact angle and the average pore diameter of the membrane. As these parameters vary, the LEP changes, which is crucial for understanding the capillary forces in the membrane:

- In the 3D surface plot (Fig. 10a), higher contact angles and smaller pore diameters generally result in increased LEP, indicative of greater difficulty for liquid to penetrate the membrane.
- The contour plots (Figs. 10b-e) at different water surface tensions ($\gamma_{L}=70 \mathrm{mN}/\mathrm{m}$, $60 \mathrm{mN}/\mathrm{m}$, $50 \mathrm{mN}/\mathrm{m}$, and $40 \mathrm{mN}/\mathrm{m}$) provide a detailed view. Higher surface tension corresponds to higher LEP values, and the effect of varying average pore diameter and contact angle is more pronounced at higher tensions.
