ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows two graphical plots comparing the performance of an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model against an algebraic model for a Sweeping Gas Membrane Evaporation (SWME) module. Both plots portray the response of the system to changes in inlet water temperature, with membrane structure parameter (Sp) and shell side pressure (Pshell) kept constant.

Plot (a) depicts heat rejection, measured in watts, as a function of the inlet water temperature ranging from around 5°C to 35°C. Both the ODE and algebraic models show an increase in heat rejection with rising inlet water temperature, with the algebraic model slightly overpredicting the values compared to the ODE model.

Plot (b) illustrates the outlet water temperature, again as a function of inlet water temperature within the same range. Both the ODE and algebraic models demonstrate a rise in outlet water temperature with increasing inlet water temperature, with the algebraic model exhibiting a consistent overprediction compared to the ODE model across the temperature range.

The model parameters are specified in the legends within the plots, indicating a shell side pressure (Pshell) of 7 torr and a membrane structure parameter (Sp) of 1.04x10^-4. The graphical data suggests the algebraic model, while generally alignive with the ODE model, tends to overestimate performance metrics for the given conditions.
