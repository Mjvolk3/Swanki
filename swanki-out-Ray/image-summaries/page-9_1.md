ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image contains two graphs labeled (a) and (b). Graph (a) shows a plot of heat rejection in watts as a function of inlet water temperature in degrees Celsius. There are two lines on this graph: one is labeled "Regular pore size" and the other is labeled "Half pore diameter," indicating that heat rejection is being compared for two different pore sizes in a membrane. The x-axis represents the inlet water temperature ranging from 5 to 35 degrees Celsius, and the y-axis represents heat rejection from 0 to about 2000 watts. 

Graph (b) shows the ratio of heat rejection when the pore size is halved to that of the regular pore size described as "q_half pore dia./q_Regular pore." The x-axis is the same as in graph (a), showing the inlet water temperature from 5 to 35 degrees Celsius. The y-axis shows the ratio of heat rejection, which ranges from 0.5 to just under 0.7 as temperature increases.

The graphs are intended to illustrate how a reduction in pore size due to factors like scaling or fouling can impact heat rejection in the context of a water treatment system described as SWME, presumably a membrane distillation system, at a shell side pressure of 7 torr and a specific structure parameter (SP) for the regular pore size.
