ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided is divided into two sections, (a) and (c), which relate to the details mentioned in the contextual information about a water removal system for spacesuits, known as the SWME (Spacesuit Water Membrane Evaporator) module.

Part (a) of the image is a simplified conceptual diagram of a single hollow fiber in the NASA SWME module. It depicts water flow from left to right, indicating the following:

- Water flow direction with inlet mass flow rate (ṁ_in) and inlet water temperature (T_in).
- Vapor pressure difference (ΔP = Pvapor - Pshell) across the membrane driving the water vapor transport from lumen (inside of the fiber) to shell side (outside).
- The pressure drop across the lumen (ΔPlumen).
- Temperature (T) along the length of the fiber, as well as the temperatures at the pore mouth (Tp) and the liquid-vapor interface at the membrane surface (Tm).

Part (c) of the image shows a differential control volume for mass and energy balance around the fiber, where water vapor flows out from the surface, and water enters and exits the control volume on the left and right sides respectively. The temperature profile (T(z)) is shown along the axis of the fiber with an increase in temperature represented as T(z+Δz) on the right side. The control volume serves to model the heat and mass transfer occurring within this segment of the fiber.

These diagrams support the comprehensive mathematical and physical modeling processes described in the text, which aim to understand and predict the behavior of the SWME system in various conditions, especially in terms of heat rejection and water vapor flux, and are instrumental for designing and operating an efficient SWME for astronaut spacesuits.
