ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of a hollow fiber for a Sweating Manikin (SWME) module with noncircular ellipsoidal pore structures. There are three panels labeled (a), (b), and (c), each displaying a different view of the membrane's structure:

(a) The top panel shows the lumen side surface of the hollow fiber. It displays a series of ellipsoidal and somewhat non-uniform pores on the surface.

(b) The middle panel depicts the shell side surface of the hollow fiber. Similarly, it has noncircular pores on the surface, but the arrangement and pore shapes appear slightly different from the lumen side.

(c) The bottom panel provides a cross-sectional view of the hollow fiber membrane. This view reveals the internal structure, which has a more fibrous texture rather than a spongy one, with the pores appearing as dark shapes within the material.

For all images, the scale bar indicates that the magnification allows for a 1.0 Î¼m length to be visually represented by the length of the scale bar. These SEM images are used to analyze the physical characteristics of the membrane's surface and cross-sectional morphology.
