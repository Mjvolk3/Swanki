ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image consists of a set of data visualizations related to the properties of a membrane used in a Seawater Membrane Evaporator (SWME) system. These visualizations likely stem from a scientific paper discussing the effects of pore size, water temperature, and contaminants on the performance of the SWME system.

Fig. 10 presents:

a) A 3D surface plot demonstrating the relationship between the liquid entry pressure (LEP) of a membrane as affected by the contact angle and average pore diameter across different water surface tension values (denoted by $\gamma_L$ ranging from 40 to 70 mN/m). The graph depicts how the LEP varies with these factors, giving insight into how the capillary properties of the membrane change.

b) To e) A series of contour plots at various fixed water surface tensions (70, 60, 50, and 40 mN/m respectively), each showing contour lines that likely represent different levels of LEP. These plots provide a two-dimensional view of how the LEP changes systematically with the contact angle and average pore diameter specific to each surface tension value.

Each plot is annotated with contour lines, possibly indicating consistent LEP values in different conditions. For instance, in the plots from (b) to (e), we see the spread of contour lines over the axis of "Average pore diameter" and "Contact angle (degrees)" which suggests how the LEP is influenced by the interaction of these two variables under the given water surface tension. The color bar in the 3D plot correlates with a numerical LEP value, offering a visual representation of pressure thresholds needed to overcome capillary forces within the membrane pores.

The aim of these visualizations is likely to aid the understanding of how the SWME system's efficiency can be impacted by physical membrane characteristics, which is relevant for optimization and troubleshooting of desalination or separation processes.
