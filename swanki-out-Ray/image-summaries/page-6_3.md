ChatGPT figure/image summary: The first image provided appears to show different magnifications of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a hollow fiber membrane, specifically used for a Seawater Membrane Evaporator (SWME) module. This membrane has noncircular ellipsoidal pore structures and the image likely consists of three parts:
- The lumen side surface of the fiber (the inside channel of the fiber),
- The shell side surface (the exterior of the fiber),
- A cross-sectional view of the hollow fiber to show the internal structure and pore geometry.

The scale bar in each of these images indicates a length of 1.0 micrometer, which allows one to gauge the size of the structures in the SEM images.

The subsequent paragraphs from the paper discuss the modeling of vapor transport through the membrane pores, particularly focusing on Knudsen diffusion. Parameters such as pore diameter, porosity, membrane thickness, and tortuosity are considered in developing a model to simulate and optimize the membrane's performance for heat rejection in various conditions, likely for space applications considering the reference to NASA data.

The other images provided contain various graphs related to the modeling and experimental validation of the hollow fiber membrane's performance in different conditions, such as varying inlet water temperatures and shell side pressures.

Fig. 3 shows graphs related to the model fitting with experimental heat rejection data:
- Model fitting with NASA reported experimental heat rejection as a function of inlet water temperature,
- Model predicted heat rejection with optimized structure parameter along with experimental heat rejection as a function of shell side pressure.

Fig. 4 illustrates liquid water temperature as a function of dimensionless length for different shell side pressures:
- For shell side pressure of 0.5 torr,
- For shell side pressure of 7 torr.

Fig. 5 presents:
- Heat rejection,
- Total mass of water vaporized,
- Outlet liquid water temperature,
- Lumen side pressure drop,
as functions of the overall membrane structure parameter for different shell side pressures.

Fig. 6 displays similar data points (heat rejection, mass of water vaporized, outlet liquid water temperature, lumen side pressure drop) as functions of inlet water temperature for a fixed shell side pressure of 7 torr.

These images collectively provide detailed visual insights into the performance characteristics of the membrane in various operational metrics, critical for optimizing the design and use of such hollow fiber membranes for effective heat and mass transfer applications, such as in life support systems where managing heat rejection is crucial.
