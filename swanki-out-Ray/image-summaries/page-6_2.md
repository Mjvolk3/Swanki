ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided shows two graphs labeled (a) and (b), both depicting the change in liquid water temperature as a function of dimensionless length (ξ).

Graph (a) illustrates the temperature profile for liquid water within a system with a shell side pressure (P_shell) of 0.5 torr and an inlet water temperature (T_in) of 20°C, for two different overall membrane structure parameters (S_p): 4x10^-4 and 1.04x10^-4. The x-axis represents the dimensionless length along the fiber, ranging from 0 to 1, while the y-axis represents the liquid water temperature in degrees Celsius, ranging from approximately 0 up to 20°C. There are two curves in the graph, one for each S_p value, showing how the temperature of the water changes as it moves through the system. The curve for S_p = 4x10^-4 falls more rapidly towards a lower temperature than the curve for S_p = 1.04x10^-4.

Graph (b) shows a similar set of temperature profiles but for a shell side pressure (P_shell) of 7 torr and the same inlet water temperature (T_in) of 20°C. Again, it features two curves for the two S_p values, indicating how the temperature changes over the course of the fiber. Like in graph (a), the temperature decrease is more pronounced for S_p = 4x10^-4 compared to S_p = 1.04x10^-4.

Both graphs illustrate how the different membrane structure parameters influence the thermal performance of a hollow fiber system used for water temperature regulation, potentially within the context of a space water management system, as the mention of Mars atmospheric pressure suggests.
