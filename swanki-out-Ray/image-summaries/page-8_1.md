ChatGPT figure/image summary: The first image appears to be a 3-dimensional (3D) surface plot along with its corresponding contour plot in Fig. 7 from the provided context. The image illustrates:

(a) A 3D surface plot of the Sweating Manikin (SWME) outlet water temperature as a function of inlet water temperature and membrane structure parameter (S P). The outlet water temperature is represented on the vertical axis, and it varies depending on the inlet water temperature and the membrane structure parameter, which are represented on the two horizontal axes. The colors on the surface plot presumably indicate different temperature ranges.
(b) A 2-dimensional (2D) contour plot that seems to correspond to the surface plot above. This plot shows lines representing different constant outlet temperatures based on varying inlet water temperatures and membrane structure parameters, allowing easy identification of conditions to achieve a targeted outlet temperature, for instance, \(10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\).

Both plots are devised to show how changing the inlet water temperature and the overall membrane structure parameter \(S_{P}\) can affect the performance of the SWME system, specifically the outlet water temperature, with a fixed shell side pressure of 7 torr. This information is critical for engineers and scientists who are interested in the thermal management of systems, possibly in applications like space suits or other similar areas where cooling is essential for operation under variable temperature conditions.
