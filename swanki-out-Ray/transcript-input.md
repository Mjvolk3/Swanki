A B S T R A C T
A comprehensive mathematical model is presented that accurately estimates and predicts failure modes through the computations of heat rejection, temperature drop and lumen side pressure drop of the hollow fiber (HF) membrane-based NASA Spacesuit Water Membrane Evaporator (SWME). The model is based on mass and energy balances in terms of the physical properties of water and membrane transport properties. The mass flux of water vapor through the pores is calculated based on Knudsen diffusion with a membrane structure parameter that accounts for effective mean pore diameter, porosity, thickness, and tortuosity. Lumen-side convective heat transfer coefficients are calculated from laminar flow boundary layer theory using the Nusselt correlation. Lumen side pressure drop is estimated using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The coupled ordinary differential equations for mass flow rate, water temperature and lumen side pressure are solved simultaneously with the equations for mass flux and convective heat transfer to determine overall heat rejection, water temperature and lumen side pressure drop. A sensitivity analysis is performed to quantify the effect of input variability on SWME response and identify critical failure modes. The analysis includes the potential effect of organic and/or inorganic contaminants and foulants, partial pore entry due to hydrophilization, and other unexpected operational failures such as bursting or fiber damage. The model can be applied to other hollow fiber membrane-based applications such as low temperature separation and concentration of valuable biomolecules from solution.

\section*{1. Introduction}

Polymeric hollow fiber membranes are ubiquitous in membranebased separations ranging from membrane distillation to pervaporation for water purification, desalination, gas separation, liquid-liquid extraction etc. [1-5]. Vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) in particular is used for water purification and treatment, desalination, liquid-liquid separation, removal of organics and recovery of solutes $[6-10]$.

The vast amount of literature published on VMD, and other membrane distillation applications using hollow fiber membranes, is relevant to the design of innovative devices like NASA's hollow fiber-based Spacesuit Water Membrane Evaporator (SWME) [11-14], The SWME is a critical component of the portable life support system in spacesuits used for extravehicular activities. It is designed to reject the heat generated by the crew member wearing the suit and the electrical components of the suit's portable life support subsystem. Heat is removed by circulating a heat transfer fluid (water) from a reservoir through a heat exchange network in the suit. The heated water is cooled by evaporating a portion of the water to space in the SWME and recirculated for thermal control. The rate of water evaporation and associated exiting liquid water temperature are controlled by adjusting the water vapor pressure in the shell of the hollow fiber module with a backpressure valve as illustrated in Fig. 1. The water reservoir is refilled as needed.

SWME operation is similar to VMD. A hot water stream is passed through a membrane module where evaporation and cooling occur. However, operational objectives are significantly different. VMD seeks to minimize heat loss due to evaporation while SWME seeks to maximize it. In contrast to VMD, SWME operations is at a lower inlet temperature and the main goal is to cool the water in the lumen side rather than producing a particular quality distillate.

VMD modeling [10,15-17] may be adapted for the SWME unit to reduce expensive experimental testing and performance evaluation and enables early detection of degradation that could lead to critical failures. This provides an added layer of operational protection for astronauts

reduction of pore opening due to deposition and fouling will be much more complicated. We do not expect significant change in membrane thickness or tortuosity of the pores resulting from contamination, deposition, and fouling.

\section*{5. Complete and partial pore entry by water}

The literature suggests polypropylene hollow fiber membranes may experience water intrusion and reduction in surface contact angle when submerged in deionized water from $\theta_{o}>115^{\circ}$ to $100^{\circ}$ for 90 days at room temperature [37]. Although the membrane was from a different supplier, contact angle reduction is likely after prolonged exposure to water. Particulates and scaling also can increase the hydrophilicity of the pore inner surface. Although a surfactant can enhance water evaporation rate from oil-in-water emulsion [38], it severely reduces water surface tension [39] and liquid entry pressure (LEP). Fig. S12 in the Supplementary information shows SWME heat rejection when some portions of the pores are larger size $(0-10 \%$ pores with $200 \mathrm{~nm}$ average diameter, which is consistent with the SEM images and pore size distribution in Fig. S3). As seen, presence of larger pore increases the heat rejection because of higher $S_{p}$ values. However, liquid water intrusion, if it occurs, can have serious consequences. Pore intrusion of liquid water can be analyzed using Laplace-Young equation (Eq. (11)), which relates liquid intrusion pressure as a function of four parameters: geometric factor ( $=1$ for cylindrical pores), water surface tension, contact angle between the liquid and surface and average pore diameter.

The geometric factor $\left(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{g}}\right)$ is less than 1.0 for non-cylindrical pores, usually 0.4-0.6 for the pores in stretched membranes [40]. As a result, liquid entry pressure can be half for stretched membrane pores, based on the geometric factor for similar sized cylindrical pores. At the operating lumen pressure ( 1.2 bar), liquid water may enter $>100 \mathrm{~nm}$ pores for a contact angle of $95^{\circ}$ and $>200 \mathrm{~nm}$ pores for a contact angle of $100^{\circ}$. Presence of organics can also affect the surface tension of water, however the effect should be negligible (as a reference, presence of $1 \mathrm{mM}$ SDS (288 ppm) reduced water surface tension by $3 \%$, whereas $2 \mathrm{mM}$ SDS (576 ppm) reduces water surface tension by $9-10 \%$ [39]. Fig. 10a illustrates LEP as a function of average pore diameter and contact angle for different liquid water surface tension ( $40-70 \mathrm{mN} / \mathrm{m}$ ). The corresponding contour plots are provided in Fig. 10b-e, where each line represents a fixed LEP for a combination of average pore diameter and contact angle. If LEP $=1$ bar, significant water entry in the pores will occur and potentially lead to system failure.

If partial liquid entry happens due to hydrophilization, the vapor path length is reduced which will increase $S_{P}$, and the flux in such case can be found by using Eq. (12). While the effect of water entry on $S_{p}$ may not be significant, the presence of a stagnant liquid layer also will affect the interface temperature between the liquid and vapor (not the temperature at pore entry) and the associated water vapor pressure driving evaporation as it introduces an additional thermal resistance.

Chamani et al. [29] have modeled partial and full pore entry by the liquid due to hydrophobicity change, which will be important during SWME operation in case of hydrophobicity change. Their results suggest the net effect of partial liquid entry will be small as the increase in vapor flux from reduced vapor path length offsets the increase in thermal resistance due to the stagnant liquid layer.

Membrane thickness has profound impact on permeant flux during vacuum membrane distillation, as well as heat transfer increase for low membrane thickness [41]. Hence, thermal performance should increase due to apparent vapor path reduction as a result of partial liquid entry. However, due to the presence of stagnant liquid layer things is much complicated. But the net effects should not be detrimental in terms of $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{p}}$.

It should be noted that a non-equilibrium evaporation layer exists at the interface between liquid and vapor. The thickness of this layer is given by Eq. (S23)in the Supplementary information [42]. Fig. S13 shows the calculated thickness of Knudsen layer as a function of pore temperature (interface temperature for partial pore entry). If the length of vapor path ( $\delta_{\mathrm{v}}$ ) is less than Knudsen layer flux equation will not be valid to describe the system.

\subsection*{5.1. Analysis of critical failure modes for SWME module}

Based on the model results and subsequent analysis, several critical failure modes can be deduced for NASA SWME module. If liquid water penetrates completely through the fraction of the pores (due to hydrophilization), it will vaporize in the shell side (For example $1 \%$ of pore leakage leads to $3.3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{h}$ of additional water loss from the system according to Hagen-Poiseuille equation). Since the reservoir capacity is around $3.6 \mathrm{~kg}$ of water, this water loss due to pore leakage will sustain the spacewalk activity only for $1-2 \mathrm{~h}$.

Burst pressure of different polymeric fibers were found to be more than 30 bars from temperature -40 to $160^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ [43]. Hence, high lumen water pressure induced fiber bursting is improbable based on an intended operational pressure of SWME water less than 1.2 bar in space. However, if any fiber detachment happens from epoxy casing, liquid water loss will be significant and reduce spacesuit operational time.

The presence of surfactant can reduce vapor pressure [44] and the driving force for evaporation significantly. This detrimental effect on thermal performance occurs even if water does not enter the pore due to a reduction in LEP; water passage through the pores (weeping) will just exacerbate the detrimental effects. Surfactant will not be introduced intentionally but potential sources of accidental introduction should be mitigated.

Another failure mode is associated with reduction of $S_{p}$ due to pore blockage, contamination, precipitation of particulates, and/or organic fouling. As shown in Fig. S9 in the Supplementary information, a reduction in $S_{P}$ results in reduced thermal performance and a corresponding increase in the outlet temperatures. If $\mathrm{T}_{\text {out }}$ is more than the desired value (say $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), the shell side pressure control valve in SWME will open more to bring it down. However, when the vacuum reaches maximum (surface pressure of Mars is 7 torr), further opening of pressure control valve will not produce desired outlet temperature and target heat rejection cannot be achieved.

\section*{6. Conclusions}

This work develops a comprehensive predictive mathematical model to estimate the thermal performance of the NASA spacesuit water membrane evaporator (SWME). The model was developed by considering mass and energy balance during the evaporation of water through the membrane pores along with diffusive transport of water vapor through the pores and differential Hagen-Poiseuille equation for lumen side water pressure drop. The model correlates critical input variables: inlet water temperature, inlet water mass flow rate, shell side pressure and overall membrane structure parameter $\left(S_{P}\right)$ to thermal performance output parameters: heat rejections, outlet water temperature, temperature drop, and lumen side pressure drop. NASA reported experimental thermal performance data was used to fit the model and estimate $S_{P}$ to be $1.04 \times 10^{-4}$, which, based on the experimentally measured average pore diameter (using SEM) and volumetric porosity (by nitrogen adsorption) provides a tortuosity value between 2.44 and 2.67 . After validation, the model was used to perform a detailed sensitivity analysis to study the effect of input variables changes on the output thermal performance parameters. Heat rejection increases (and outlet water temperature decreases) with increasing membrane parameter and/or inlet water temperature but decreases with higher shell side pressure, as expected. An approximate algebraic solution for the model was also developed by considering average physical properties, which was found to be applicable for $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{in}}<8{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The role of particulates, contaminants and foulants on thermal performance of SWME unit was analyzed and discussed as well as partial pore entry caused by hydrophobicity change in the entrance portion of the pores (lumen side). For example, a 45\% reduction in $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{P}}$ (due to pore blockage and/or pore size reduction) is

tolerable to maintain nominal heat load at 7 torr (Martian surface atmospheric pressure). The critical failure modes are discussed based on the model analysis and results. As an example, $1 \%$ of fiber bursting/ leakage will lead to an additional $3.6 \mathrm{~kg}$ water loss from the SWME system, which will reduce spacewalk activity to only $1-2 \mathrm{~h}$. The work delivers tremendous advancement in the field of hollow fiber-based membrane applications by providing a mathematical framework to analyze and predict critical process parameters and the effects of contaminants and foulants on thermal performances. A future application of the model and analysis will be to predict hollow fiber-based membrane separation performance following concentration and purification of biomolecules at lower temperature from dilute aqueous solution.

during spacewalks

Most past studies of VMD focus on the production of potable water from saline solutions, which is usually performed at relatively high temperatures $\left(30-80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ [17]. Energy efficiency is a key issue in VMD [18] but past work has not focused on thermal performance and characterizing the dependence of performance on membrane properties and operating conditions, which is key in design and operation of SWME operation. A comprehensive thermal performance model also is needed to analyze other advanced hollow fiber membrane applications like low temperature concentration of expensive biomolecules or foodstuffs where lyophilization is not suitable [19].

Performance metrics critical to SWME application include outlet water temperature, heat rejection, and rate of water loss per unit heat rejection. Lumen-side pressure drop and vapor flow rate across the membrane are important as they provide insight into undesirable scenarios such as bursting and water leakage or weeping through the pores. A comprehensive mathematical model that can predict thermal performance as a function of water inlet conditions and membrane parameters (pore size and shape, porosity, tortuosity etc.) is of utmost importance. However, modeling is complicated by several factors (e.g., low pressure evaporation of water, pore non-uniformity, difficulties in measuring tortuosity, maintaining sufficient porosity without compromising structural integrity etc.) and an unavoidable long term performance deterioration due to particulate, contaminant, and foulant build-up in the system $[20-22]$.

The VMD modeling literature has relied predominantly on arithmetic approaches with algebraic equations [16,23]. Recently, Kim et al. [17] reported a model for VMD with differential mass and energy balances, in which they estimated the vapor flux by fitting the model with experimental data. Zhang et al. [16] used the Knudsen diffusion flux equation with a single membrane transport parameter (heretofore referred to as the "membrane structure parameter") and used gas permeation to estimate the parameter experimentally. However, the prediction of thermal performance (heat rejection and temperature) by the VMD model was not explored in both studies.

Here, we develop a model for the NASA SWME unit using a differential mass and energy balance approach. The model explicitly includes the temperature dependence of all water physical properties (water latent heat of vaporization, heat capacity, vapor pressure, density, and viscosity). Membrane vapor flux is calculated using Knudsen diffusion (based on Knudsen number) and the lumen-side convective heat transfer is calculated from the Nusselt correlation for laminar flow in circular flow channels. The lumen-side pressure drop is estimated from the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The membrane structure parameter is determined by fitting predicted heat rejection values to the experimental SWME values reported by Bue et al. [24].

In contrast to various VMD publications, which are mainly explored for water desalination, our paper advances the science of membranebased cooling of water. Quantification of the role of input process and driving force variables are performed, as well as membrane properties through fundamental mass and heat transfer equations. In addition to the elegant spacesuit applications, one can apply this concept for low temperature separation and concentration of heat sensitive materials. The model is used to evaluate the effect of membrane structure parameter, porosity, pore diameter and tortuosity on heat rejection, temperature drop and lumen side pressure drop. Additionally, the

ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided is divided into two sections, (a) and (c), which relate to the details mentioned in the contextual information about a water removal system for spacesuits, known as the SWME (Spacesuit Water Membrane Evaporator) module.

Part (a) of the image is a simplified conceptual diagram of a single hollow fiber in the NASA SWME module. It depicts water flow from left to right, indicating the following:

- Water flow direction with inlet mass flow rate (ṁ_in) and inlet water temperature (T_in).
- Vapor pressure difference (ΔP = Pvapor - Pshell) across the membrane driving the water vapor transport from lumen (inside of the fiber) to shell side (outside).
- The pressure drop across the lumen (ΔPlumen).
- Temperature (T) along the length of the fiber, as well as the temperatures at the pore mouth (Tp) and the liquid-vapor interface at the membrane surface (Tm).

Part (c) of the image shows a differential control volume for mass and energy balance around the fiber, where water vapor flows out from the surface, and water enters and exits the control volume on the left and right sides respectively. The temperature profile (T(z)) is shown along the axis of the fiber with an increase in temperature represented as T(z+Δz) on the right side. The control volume serves to model the heat and mass transfer occurring within this segment of the fiber.

These diagrams support the comprehensive mathematical and physical modeling processes described in the text, which aim to understand and predict the behavior of the SWME system in various conditions, especially in terms of heat rejection and water vapor flux, and are instrumental for designing and operating an efficient SWME for astronaut spacesuits.)

dependence of thermal performance on pore size distribution, hydrophobicity change, and the role of contaminant fouling during continuous SWME operation is examined as part of a failure mode analysis. The specific objectives are: (i) developing a comprehensive mathematical model to accurately predict reported experimental thermal performances and estimating membrane structure parameter for SWME, (ii) performing a sensitivity analysis to understand the effect of input process variables on output thermal performance, (iii) understanding the role of contaminants and organic foulants on long-term thermal performance degradation and (iv) evaluating the conditions that can lead to critical failure modes.

\section*{2. Materials and methods}

Pore structure and morphology of the hollow fibers for SWME module (HF-SWME) were examined using a FEI Helios Nanolab 660 Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) at the University of Kentucky Electron Microscopy Center (EMC). Samples were prepared for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging by mounting on a $90^{\circ}$ sample holder (aluminum stub) with double sided carbon tape (Nisshin). For lumen surface views, a small fiber piece was cut axially with scissors to expose the lumen. For cross-sectional views, fibers were cut using a sharp razor blade at room temperature and mounted on a silicon wafer with copper tape for polishing using an argon ion-beam polisher (JEOL cooling cross section polisher IB-19520CCP) with settings of $4.0 \mathrm{kV}, 5.0 \mathrm{Ar}$ gas flow setting at $-120^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with $40 \mathrm{~s} / 20 \mathrm{~s}$ (on/off) for $8 \mathrm{~h}$ and stage swing enabled) [25]. The polished samples were mounted on a $90^{\circ}$ sample holder (aluminum stub) and sputter coated with $5 \mathrm{~nm}$ Pt layer (using a Leica EM ACE600 instrument) prior to SEM imaging. Surface characterization of the hollow fibers was performed using $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ sorption experiments conducted at $77 \mathrm{~K}$ with a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 instrument. Specific surface area was determined using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) isotherm method and pore volume, average pore size and pore size distribution were calculated using the method of Barrett, Joyner and Halenda (BJH).

The model equations were developed assuming all fibers are identical and fluid distribution into the fibers from the distribution manifolds is uniform. Fig. 1 illustrates a single representative fiber and the operational variables: inlet water flow rate, $\dot{m}_{i n}$; inlet water temperature, $T_{i n}$; and the driving force for water vapor transport from lumen to shell side, $\Delta P=P_{\text {vapor }}-P_{\text {shell }}$, where $P_{\text {vapor }}$ is the water vapor pressure at the water temperature adjacent to the membrane and $P_{\text {shell }}$ is the shell side pressure. Fig. 1 also illustrates the SWME module and the backpressure valve on the case used to control pressure in the shell-side space outside the fiber; the valve opens to reduce shell-side pressure if the target outlet water temperature is too high. Detailed model development from mass and energy balances for a control volume surrounding a differential fiber length (see Fig. 1) is provided in the Supplementary Information.

\subsection*{3.1. Overall model to predict SWME performance}

The variation of water flow rate in the lumen is given by:

$\frac{d \dot{m}}{d \xi}=-J_{k} \pi d_{l} L$

where, $\dot{m}$ is the water mass flow rate $(\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{s}), J_{k}$ is the vapor mass flux across the membrane $\left(\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}\right), d_{l}$ is the lumen diameter, L is total fiber length, and $\xi$ is the normalized dimensionless length. Note that the vapor flux depends on temperature and thus is a function of axial position. The initial condition for Eq. (1a) is:

$\dot{m}=\dot{m}_{i n}$ at $\xi=0$ where $\dot{m}_{i n}$ is the inlet mass flow rate per fiber.

Similarly, the variation of water temperature in the lumen is given by Eq. (2a) (see Supplementary Information for detail):

$\frac{d T}{d \xi}=\frac{-\lambda_{v}}{\dot{m} C_{p}}\left(J_{k} \pi d_{l} L\right)$

where, $C_{p}$ is the specific heat capacity of water (Joules $/ \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{K}$ ), a function of temperature and $\lambda_{v}$ is the water latent heat of vaporization (Joules/ $\mathrm{kg}$ ), also a function of temperature. Initial condition for Eq. (2a) is:

$T=T_{\text {in }}$ at $\xi=0$

where $T_{\text {in }}$ is the inlet temperature.

Since water vapor fluxes are small compared to the lumen flow rate, the lumen pressure drop is calculated from the differential Hagen-Poiseuille Equation:

$\frac{d P_{\text {lumen }}}{d \xi}=-\frac{128 \mu \dot{m} L}{\pi \rho d_{l}^{4}}$

where, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of water (Pa.s) and $\rho$ is the density $(\mathrm{kg} /$ $\mathrm{m}^{3}$ ). Note both are functions of lumen temperature. The initial condition for Eq. (3a) is:

$P_{\text {lumen }}=\left(P_{\text {lumen }}\right)_{\text {in }}$ at $\xi=0$

where $\left(P_{\text {lumen }}\right)_{\text {in }}$ is the inlet lumen water pressure.

The equation for convective heat transfer in lumen side boundary layer can be expressed as:

$h_{c}\left(T-T_{p}\right)=-\lambda_{v} J_{k}$

where, $h_{c}$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient $\left(\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{m}^{2} / \mathrm{K}\right)$ and $T_{p}$ is the pore mouth temperature $(\mathrm{K})$, a function of position along the fiber (can be assumed equal to $T_{m}$, liquid-vapor interface temperature when the interface is at the pore mouth).

The convective heat transfer coefficient is estimated from the Nusselt correlation for laminar flow in tubes. In the entry mass transfer limit, $N u=\frac{h_{c} d_{l}}{\kappa_{w}}=1.86\left(\frac{R e P r d_{l}}{L}\right)^{0.33}$, where $R e=\frac{v_{w} d_{l \rho}}{\mu}$ is the Reynolds number and $\operatorname{Pr}=\frac{C_{p} \mu}{\kappa_{w}}$ is the Prandtl number. The thermal entry length is $1 / 100$ th of the fiber length in the absence of evaporation and the flow in the lumen can be considered fully developed laminar flow. For fully developed laminar flow in the well-developed heat transfer limit, $N u=4.36$. Since the shell is under high vacuum, heat conduction in the shell is negligible in VMD [15]. While the fluid thermal boundary layer is indeed included in the heat transfer calculations, the effect is small. The difference between the bulk and inner surface temperature is less than $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for the results presented here. Also note that in our supplement we do discuss (Eq S7 and S8, and Eq (4) above)) and account for pore temp being not same as bulk lumen side water.

The calculation of water vapor flux through the pores is critical to modeling SWME performance. The flux should be calculated using either Knudsen diffusion or molecular diffusion based on the Knudsen number, $K_{n}=\frac{l}{d_{p}}$, where $l$ is the mean free path and $d_{p}$ is the mean pore diameter.

The mean free path can be calculated from [27]:

$l=\frac{k_{B} T_{p}}{\sqrt{2} \pi P \sigma^{2}}$

where, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant $\left(k_{B}=1.381 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{K}\right), T_{p}$ is the pore temperature, $P$ is the mean pore pressure at pore opening ( $P=$ $\left.P_{\text {vapor }}\right)[28]$, and $\sigma$ is the collision diameter ( $2.641 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}$ for water).

When water permeation occurs by Knudsen diffusion, the water flux is given by:

$\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{k}}=(0.0248) S_{P} \sqrt{\frac{1}{T_{p}}}(\Delta P)$

where $S_{p}$ is the overall membrane structure parameter $\left(S_{P}=\frac{d_{p} \varphi_{p}}{\delta \tau}\right), d_{p}$ is the mean pore diameter, $\varphi_{\mathrm{p}}$ is membrane porosity, $\delta$ is membrane thickness, and $\tau$ is membrane tortuosity.

Differential equations (1)-(3) are solved in MATLAB $\circledR^{\circ}$ using an adaptive Runge-Kutta method ("ode45 solver"). Values for the temperature dependent material properties are provided in the Supplemental Information (Table S1). Ranges of operational variables ( $\dot{m}_{\text {in }}, T_{i n}$, $\left(P_{\text {lumen }}\right)_{\text {in }}$ and $\left.P_{\text {shell }}\right)$ and membrane parameters used in the simulations are provided in Table S2 in the Supplementary information.

Model outputs are temperature and mass flow rate as a function of position. These are used to calculate heat rejection, total mass of water vaporized and lumen side pressure drop from Eqs. (7)-(9), respectively:

Heat rejection, $q=\int_{0}^{L} \lambda_{v} \dot{m}_{v} d z$

Total mass of water vaporized, $\left(\dot{m}_{v}\right)_{\text {tot }}=\dot{m}_{\text {in }}-\dot{m}_{\text {out }}$

Pressure drop across lumen side, $\Delta P_{\text {lumen }}=\left(P_{\text {lumen }}\right)_{\text {in }}-\left(P_{\text {lumen }}\right)_{\text {out }}$

In Eq. (7), $\lambda_{v}$ and $\dot{m}_{v}$ are temperature dependent and therefore vary with position.

For certain cases (low inlet water temperature, $<10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), one can convert the above equations into an algebraic form by considering the average properties of water at $T_{\text {avg }}=\left(T_{\text {in }}+T_{\text {out }}\right) / 2$. The result is given by (see Supporting Information for derivation):

$\left(h_{c}\right)_{\text {avg }}\left(T_{\text {in }}-\frac{\left(\lambda_{v}\right)_{\text {avg }}}{2\left(C_{p}\right)_{\text {avg }}} \ln \left(\frac{\dot{m}_{\text {in }}}{\dot{m}_{\text {in }}-\left(J_{k}\right)_{\text {avg }} \pi d_{l} L}\right)-\left(T_{p}\right)_{\text {avg }}\right)=+\left(\lambda_{v}\right)_{\text {avg }}\left(J_{k}\right)_{\text {avg }}$

where, $\left(J_{k}\right)_{\text {avg }},\left(\lambda_{v}\right)_{\text {avg }},\left(C_{p}\right)_{\text {avg }}$ and $\left(h_{c}\right)_{\text {avg }}$ are the vapor mass flux, latent heat of vaporization, water heat capacity, and convective heat transport coefficient evaluated at the average pore temperature $\left(T_{p}\right)_{\text {avg }}$. Eq. (10) is solved along with Eq. (6) to find $\left(T_{p}\right)_{\text {avg }}$. The value is used to calculate $\dot{m}_{\text {out }}$ and $T_{\text {out }}$ (see Supporting Information). Finally, heat rejection, mass of water vaporized, and lumen side pressure drop are calculated using Eqs. (7), (8) and (11) respectively.

$\Delta P_{\text {lumen }}=\frac{128 \mu_{\text {avg }} L(\dot{m})_{\text {avg }}}{\pi \rho_{\text {avg }} d_{l}^{4}}$

where, $\mu_{\text {avg }}$ and $\rho_{\text {avg }}$ are the viscosity and density of water evaluated at $T_{\text {avg }}$ and $(\dot{m})_{\text {avg }}=\frac{\dot{m}_{\text {in }}+\dot{m}_{\text {out }}}{2}$ is the average mass flow rate of water.

\subsection*{3.2. Liquid entry into the pores}

Liquid entry into the pores is analyzed by Laplace equation as shown in Eq. (11), which relates liquid entry pressure (LEP) to membrane and liquid properties.

$L E P=-\frac{4 B_{g} \gamma_{L} \cos \theta_{o}}{d_{P}}$

where, $\gamma_{L}$ and $\theta_{o}$ are the surface tension of the liquid and initial contact angle of the liquid with polymeric membrane, respectively, and $B_{g}$ is the geometric factor ( $B_{g}=1$, for cylindrical pores). Now if a portion of the pore in contact with liquid (lumen side) gets hydrophilized enough due to fouling such that the lumen side pressure is greater than LEP, liquid will enter the pores up to the end of hydrophilized portion (Fig. S1 in Supplementary information). For a single pore with partial liquid entry up to the length of $\delta_{\mathrm{L}}$, if the vapor traveling path length is $\delta_{\mathrm{V}}$, the water vapor flux in that case is given by:

$\left(J_{k}\right)_{v a p}=(0.0248) \frac{\delta}{\delta_{V}} S_{P} \sqrt{\frac{1}{T_{s}}}(\Delta P)$

where $T_{s}$ is the vapor liquid interface temperature. In the absence of liquid entry, $T_{s}$ is assumed to be equal to $T_{p}$ as discussed previously. However, in the case of partial liquid entry $T_{s} \neq T_{p}$ and $P_{\text {vapor }}$ in Eq. (12) is a function of $T_{s}$, which also is unknown.

If water wets the pores, the liquid mass flux can be estimated from the Hagen-Poiseulle equation for flow through the pores [29]:

$\left(J_{k}\right)_{\text {liq }}=\frac{\pi \rho d_{P}^{4}}{128 \mu \delta_{L}}\left(P_{\text {lumen }}-P_{\text {vapor }}+P_{c}\right)$

where, $P_{c}=\frac{4 \gamma_{L} \cos \theta}{d_{P}}$ is the capillary pressure and $\gamma_{L}$ and $\theta$ are the surface tension of the liquid and changed contact angle of the fiber in the portion of the membrane that is wetted, respectively. Physical properties $\mu$ and $\rho$ also are temperature dependent and can be evaluated at an average temperature of $\frac{T_{P}+T_{s}}{2}$.

\section*{4. Results and discussion}

The system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that comprise the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy equations for a single SWME fiber (Eqs. (1)-(3)) was solved with MATLAB® ode45 solver along with the equations for convective heat transfer coefficient in the lumen side and diffusion of vapor through the pores to obtain liquid water mass flow rate through the lumen, liquid water temperature, pore temperature and lumen side pressure profiles as a function of axial position. These results are then used to calculate the values of heat rejection, total mass of water loss, temperature drop and lumen side pressure drop that are critical to performance of the spacesuit SWME.

\subsection*{4.1. Hollow fiber characterization}

NASA experimental thermal performance measurements for the HFSWME were used to validate the model and estimate the membrane structural parameter $S_{p}$. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of the lumen side surface, shell side surface and cross section of the HFSWME membranes are shown in Fig. 2. Images show more uniform pore structure in both lumen and shell side with somewhat ellipsoidal pore opening shape, whereas the internal pore structure is more fibrous than spongy (i.e. bounded by polymer strands (not ellipsoidal cavities) as observed in polyvinylidene fluoride or PVDF membranes) as seen in the cross-sectional image [25]. As a result, SWME fibers have less variability in pore size compared to more commonly used PVDF or polyether sulfone (PES) membranes. The lumen-side pore size distribution (major axis, minor axis and circular equivalent diameter, $\sqrt{\text { major axis } * \text { minor axis }}$ is provided in Supplementary Information Fig. S3 based on measurements of 120 random pores from SEM images like the one provided in Fig. 2a. The major axis has wide pore distribution, whereas minor axis (which is more important for the diffusion of water vapor) has narrower pore distribution with some pores skewed towards the $100 \mathrm{~nm}$ size. The equivalent circular diameter (Fig. S3c) shows $\sim 6 \%$ of the pores are larger than $100 \mathrm{~nm}$.

Sorption isotherms and the corresponding BJH pore size distribution obtained from the desorption branch are provided in the Supplementary Information Fig. S4. The isotherms showed capillary condensation with a hysteresis loop consistent with a pore size around $50 \mathrm{~nm}$ [25]. The BJH pore size distribution showed a peak at $34 \mathrm{~nm}$, which is consistent with minor axis pore size distribution of SEM images, with $5 \%$ of pores $>100$ $\mathrm{nm}$ based on the cumulative pore volume. Volumetric porosity calculated from the pore volume of nitrogen sorption are $24-28 \%$ for different experiments, which is much smaller than the $40 \%$ manufacturer reported porosity.

ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of a hollow fiber for a Sweating Manikin (SWME) module with noncircular ellipsoidal pore structures. There are three panels labeled (a), (b), and (c), each displaying a different view of the membrane's structure:

(a) The top panel shows the lumen side surface of the hollow fiber. It displays a series of ellipsoidal and somewhat non-uniform pores on the surface.

(b) The middle panel depicts the shell side surface of the hollow fiber. Similarly, it has noncircular pores on the surface, but the arrangement and pore shapes appear slightly different from the lumen side.

(c) The bottom panel provides a cross-sectional view of the hollow fiber membrane. This view reveals the internal structure, which has a more fibrous texture rather than a spongy one, with the pores appearing as dark shapes within the material.

For all images, the scale bar indicates that the magnification allows for a 1.0 μm length to be visually represented by the length of the scale bar. These SEM images are used to analyze the physical characteristics of the membrane's surface and cross-sectional morphology.)

\subsection*{4.2. Estimation of structure parameter and model validation}

Only Knudsen diffusion through the pores is considered to model vapor transport through the membrane pores based on the calculated Knudsen number as a function of pore temperature for different pore diameters (see Fig. S5 in Supplementary information). For pore diameters up to $400 \mathrm{~nm}$ and pore temperatures of $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the Knudsen number is well above the threshold for Knudsen diffusion ( $K n>1.0$ ), so the vapor mass flux is estimated using the Knudsen diffusion equation (Eq. (5)).

Pore diameter, porosity, membrane thickness and tortuosity are lumped together in the overall membrane structure parameter ( $S_{P}=$ $\frac{d_{p} \varphi_{p}}{\delta \tau}$ ) in the flux equation. Using the manufacturer reported values for the HF-SWME $\left(d_{P}=40 \mathrm{~nm}, \varphi_{P}=40 \%\right.$ with $\delta=40 \mu \mathrm{m}$ and $\tau=1.0$ (if pores are straight)), $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{P}}$ is $4.0 \times 10^{-4}$. Although pore diameter of the membrane (HF-SWME) was measured and found close to manufacturer reported values (both lumen and shell side) [25], nitrogen adsorption gives a porosity of $24 \%$ and tortuosity was not verified. However, model predictions can be compared to experimental thermal performance data to obtain the best fit value of $S_{P}$. Heat rejection values over a range of inlet temperatures reported by NASA for a hollow fiber module of $18 \mathrm{~cm}$ length, 14,300 fibers with fully open backpressure valve (Bue et al. [24]) are used for the comparison and model validation. Using a $S_{P}$ value of $4.0 \times 10^{-4}$, the model overpredicts heat rejection by a factor of two (Fig. 3a). The value of $S_{P}$ that best fits the data is $1.04 \times 10^{-4}$ with a $\mathrm{R}^{2}$ value of $0.9965 . S_{P}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}$ provides the best fit and the error in heat rejection is only $0.3 \%$. Using $\mathrm{d}_{\mathrm{p}}=42 \mathrm{~nm}$ (shell surface) and $46 \mathrm{~nm}$ (lumen surface), $\varphi_{\mathrm{P}}=24 \%$ (measured by nitrogen adsorption [25]), and $\delta=40 \mu \mathrm{m}$ provides $\tau=2.44$ and 2.67 , respectively, for $S_{P}=1.04 \times$ $10^{-4}$. Note that both values are very close to the previously reported $\tau=$ 2.5 for polypropylene membrane hollow fibers [5,30]. For $S_{P}=1.04 \times$ $10^{-4}$, model predictions of heat rejection are in excellent agreement with experimental data for the range of feed temperatures and shell pressures reported indicating robustness of the model in hollow fiber membrane applications.

The model was also validated by the experimental vapor flux reported by Sun et al. (2014) [31] for PVDF membranes with the reported membrane properties: average pore size, porosity and membrane permeability (Fig. S6a in the Supplementary Materials). Model predicted vapor flux values are similar to the experimental flux values except for $d_{P}=0.282 \mu \mathrm{m}$ and inlet water temperature of $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The agreement is remarkable despite a very non-uniform pore structure with large macrovoids introduced by the phase inversion process used to form the membranes. Model estimated temperature drop is shown in Fig. S6b, which shows a low temperature drop due to high water flow rate in the lumen side.

\subsection*{4.3. Model prediction results for new generation SWME module}

Using the best fit value for the HF-SWME membrane structure factor, the model was used to evaluate the current SWME module design containing 27,900 fibers and an active fiber length of $11.9 \mathrm{~cm}$ (see Supplementary Information for other membrane input parameters). Model predicted liquid water temperature as a function of dimensionless length is shown in Fig. 4a and b for shell side pressure of 0.5 torr and 7 torr (Mars atmospheric pressure), respectively. For 0.5 torr shell side pressure, at high.

$S_{P}\left(4.0 \times 10^{-4}\right)$, the temperature approaches $0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at the midpoint of the fiber length whereas the temperatures remain above zero for $S_{P}=$ $1.04 \times 10^{-4}$. Although a negative water temperature can occur for water evaporation at low pressure [32], the lumen side pressure is $>1$ bar and a negative temperature will form ice which should be avoided in the SWME application. Note that calculations were stopped when the temperature dropped to zero. For 7 torr shell side pressure (Fig. 4b), the outlet water temperature was $7.2{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $12.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $S_{P}=4.0 \times 10^{-4}$ and $1.04 \times 10^{-4}$, respectively.

For 0.5 torr shell side pressure and $S_{P}=4.0 \times 10^{-4}$, the water vapor flux is very high and water temperature drops rapidly as a result. Fig. S7 in Supporting Information shows corresponding water vapor mass flow rate through the pores for $T_{\text {in }}=20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. For $P_{\text {shell }}=0.5$ torr (Fig. S7a) and high $S_{P}$, water vapor mass flow rate is very high near the entrance but drops rapidly as the water cools. Conversely, for $P_{\text {shell }}=7$ torr (Fig. S7b), the vapor mass flow rate is high near the entrance for high $S_{P}$ but drops below the value for

$S_{P}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}$ around $\xi=0.67$

Fig. 5 shows heat rejection, total mass of water vaporized, liquid water temperature at the outlet and lumen side pressure drops as a function of overall membrane structure parameter for different shell side pressure at $\mathrm{T}_{\text {in }}=20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Heat rejection and mass of water vaporized increase as either the structural parameter increases or shell pressure decreases (Fig. 5a and b). However, for $\mathrm{P}_{\text {shell }}=0.5$ torr and 3 torr, heat rejection reaches a maximum at a certain $S_{\mathrm{P}}$, after which there is no

ChatGPT figure/image summary: The first image provided is an SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) image displaying hollow fibers from an SWME (Sweating Manikin Wetted Membrane Evaporator) module. There are three parts to the image: (a) shows the lumen side surface, (b) displays the shell side surface, and (c) provides a cross-sectional view of the fibers, revealing noncircular ellipsoidal pore structures. All images have a scale bar indicating $1.0 \mu \mathrm{m}$.

The second set of images consists of graphs from Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, associated with the paper's discussion on model validation and prediction results for the SWME module, respectively. However, the images are repeated several times, likely due to an error in the provided links, and hence only the descriptions of Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 are provided above. 

- Fig. 3 presents two graphs: (a) illustrates model fitting with NASA reported experimental data for heat rejection as a function of inlet water temperature and (b) shows model predicted heat rejection with optimized structure parameter (Sp) along with experimental heat rejection as a function of shell side pressure.
  
- Fig. 4 includes two graphs depicting liquid water temperature as a function of dimensionless length for different values of Sp, with one graph each for shell side pressures of 0.5 torr (a) and 7 torr (b).

The third image is Fig. 5, comprised of four graphs representing: (a) heat rejection, (b) total mass of water vaporized, (c) outlet liquid water temperature, and (d) lumen side pressure drop as a function of the overall membrane structure parameter (Sp) at different shell side pressures.

The fourth image is Fig. 6, which includes four graphs as well: (a) heat rejection, (b) total mass of water vaporized, (c) outlet liquid water temperature, and (d) lumen side pressure drop as a function of inlet water temperature for different overall membrane structure parameter (Sp) values, all at a shell pressure of 7 torr.

Since the images are incidental and somewhat summarized here, the provided contextual information primarily explains the technical aspects and findings from the research.)

ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided shows two graphs labeled (a) and (b), both depicting the change in liquid water temperature as a function of dimensionless length (ξ).

Graph (a) illustrates the temperature profile for liquid water within a system with a shell side pressure (P_shell) of 0.5 torr and an inlet water temperature (T_in) of 20°C, for two different overall membrane structure parameters (S_p): 4x10^-4 and 1.04x10^-4. The x-axis represents the dimensionless length along the fiber, ranging from 0 to 1, while the y-axis represents the liquid water temperature in degrees Celsius, ranging from approximately 0 up to 20°C. There are two curves in the graph, one for each S_p value, showing how the temperature of the water changes as it moves through the system. The curve for S_p = 4x10^-4 falls more rapidly towards a lower temperature than the curve for S_p = 1.04x10^-4.

Graph (b) shows a similar set of temperature profiles but for a shell side pressure (P_shell) of 7 torr and the same inlet water temperature (T_in) of 20°C. Again, it features two curves for the two S_p values, indicating how the temperature changes over the course of the fiber. Like in graph (a), the temperature decrease is more pronounced for S_p = 4x10^-4 compared to S_p = 1.04x10^-4.

Both graphs illustrate how the different membrane structure parameters influence the thermal performance of a hollow fiber system used for water temperature regulation, potentially within the context of a space water management system, as the mention of Mars atmospheric pressure suggests.)

ChatGPT figure/image summary: The first image provided appears to show different magnifications of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a hollow fiber membrane, specifically used for a Seawater Membrane Evaporator (SWME) module. This membrane has noncircular ellipsoidal pore structures and the image likely consists of three parts:
- The lumen side surface of the fiber (the inside channel of the fiber),
- The shell side surface (the exterior of the fiber),
- A cross-sectional view of the hollow fiber to show the internal structure and pore geometry.

The scale bar in each of these images indicates a length of 1.0 micrometer, which allows one to gauge the size of the structures in the SEM images.

The subsequent paragraphs from the paper discuss the modeling of vapor transport through the membrane pores, particularly focusing on Knudsen diffusion. Parameters such as pore diameter, porosity, membrane thickness, and tortuosity are considered in developing a model to simulate and optimize the membrane's performance for heat rejection in various conditions, likely for space applications considering the reference to NASA data.

The other images provided contain various graphs related to the modeling and experimental validation of the hollow fiber membrane's performance in different conditions, such as varying inlet water temperatures and shell side pressures.

Fig. 3 shows graphs related to the model fitting with experimental heat rejection data:
- Model fitting with NASA reported experimental heat rejection as a function of inlet water temperature,
- Model predicted heat rejection with optimized structure parameter along with experimental heat rejection as a function of shell side pressure.

Fig. 4 illustrates liquid water temperature as a function of dimensionless length for different shell side pressures:
- For shell side pressure of 0.5 torr,
- For shell side pressure of 7 torr.

Fig. 5 presents:
- Heat rejection,
- Total mass of water vaporized,
- Outlet liquid water temperature,
- Lumen side pressure drop,
as functions of the overall membrane structure parameter for different shell side pressures.

Fig. 6 displays similar data points (heat rejection, mass of water vaporized, outlet liquid water temperature, lumen side pressure drop) as functions of inlet water temperature for a fixed shell side pressure of 7 torr.

These images collectively provide detailed visual insights into the performance characteristics of the membrane in various operational metrics, critical for optimizing the design and use of such hollow fiber membranes for effective heat and mass transfer applications, such as in life support systems where managing heat rejection is crucial.)

Fig. 5. (a) Heat rejection, (b) total mass of water vaporized, (c) outlet liquid water temperature and (d) lumen side pressure drop as a function of overall membrane structure parameter $(\mathrm{Sp})$ for different shell side pressure $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\text {shell }}\right) . \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{in}}=20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $\dot{m}_{i n}=91 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{h}$.

increase in heat rejection as well as mass of water vaporized. Also, at low shell side pressure outlet temperature approaches $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for higher values of $S_{p}$ (Fig. 5c). For lower shell side pressure and higher values of $S_{P}$, liquid water temperature approaches $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ before the end of the fiber and no heat rejection can be obtained downstream of that point (calculation stopped), which can help to estimate fiber length necessary for low

temperature hollow fiber applications

In addition to membrane structure parameter and shell side pressure, inlet water temperature strongly influences thermal performance. Heat rejection, total mass of water vaporized, outlet water temperature and lumen side pressure drop as a function of inlet water temperature for $\mathrm{P}_{\text {shell }}=7$ torr are shown in Fig. 6. As expected, heat rejection and mass of water vaporized increase with inlet water temperature for all values of $S_{P}$ due to increased driving force for vapor flux. Outlet water temperature also increases with inlet water temperature, however for high value of $S_{P}\left(=6 \times 10^{-4}\right)$ the effect is minimal. Under these conditions, outlet temperature never decreases below $6{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, at which temperature the vapor pressure of water is 7 torr. For $\mathrm{P}_{\text {shell }}=7$ torr (atmospheric pressure at Mars), inlet temperatures below $6{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ will not produce any cooling. However, in the moon, where atmospheric pressure is 0 torr, very low inlet water temperature is also feasible. The lumen side pressure drop is very small compared to the inlet water pressure ( 1.2 bar). At 0.5 torr (data not shown), heat rejection and mass of water vaporized increase with increasing temperature for all values of $S_{P}$. However, for higher values of $S p$ there is no increase in heat rejection or mass of water vaporized with increasing $S_{\mathrm{P}}$, consistent with Fig. 5, and the outlet temperature remains close to $0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for higher $S_{\mathrm{P}}$ values.

Another important inlet variable is the liquid water mass flow rate, which gives us the indication of blockage or bursting in the lumen side. Fig. S8 in the Supplementary information shows heat rejection and outlet water temperature as a function of inlet water flow rate at $25{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $S_{P}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}$ for different shell side pressure. Outlet water temperature and heat rejection both decrease with decreasing water flow rate as there is less water to cool and temperature drops rapidly.

\subsection*{4.4. Evaluation of conditions for finding fixed lumen outlet water temperature}

For nominal conditions, the anticipated heat load for a spacewalk is around $350 \mathrm{~W}(300 \mathrm{~W}$ from the astronaut's body and $50 \mathrm{~W}$ from the electronics) [33]. The nominal inlet water temperature is around $17{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and targeted outlet temperature is $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. From Fig. 5, when $T_{i n}=20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the adjusted membrane parameter $\left(S_{p}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}\right.$, obtained from fitting SWME experimental thermal performance data) results in $T_{\text {out }}=$ $13{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $P_{\text {shell }}=7$ torr, which is higher than targeted $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Outlet temperature and heat rejection plots for lower $T_{\text {in }}$ are shown in the Supplementary Information (Fig. S9). When $T_{i n}=17{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, S_{P}=1.04 \times$ $10^{-4}$ results in $T_{\text {out }}=11.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $P_{\text {shell }}=7$ torr, which is higher than targeted $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. However, heat rejection is $556 \mathrm{~W}$ for $P_{\text {shell }}=7$ torr, which is higher than nominal heat load ( $350 \mathrm{~W}$ ), and a reduction of $44 \% \mathrm{~S}_{\mathrm{p}}$ can be tolerated to maintain $360 \mathrm{~W}$ heat rejection. When $T_{\text {in }}=13.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, S_{P}=$ $1.04 \times 10^{-4}$ results in $T_{\text {out }}=10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $P_{\text {shell }}=7$ torr, which is exactly the outlet temperature desired. For $T_{\text {in }}=13.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, heat rejection is also 355 $\mathrm{W}$ for $P_{\text {shell }}=7$ torr, at that point any reduction in $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{p}}$ will results in increase in outlet temperature due to low heat rejection.

Fig. 7a illustrates the dependence of outlet water temperature (Tout) on inlet water temperature and membrane structure parameter $(S P)$ as a color heat map for a shell pressure of 7 torr. Clearly, outlet water temperature increases with both inlet water temperature and reduction of $S P$. The corresponding contour plot is provided in Fig. 7b. Using the contour plots, combination of inlet water temperature, $S P$ and Pshell can be chosen for a targeted outlet water temperature (for example $10{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ).

Evaluation of Approximate Algebraic Solution:

An approximate algebraic solution of the comprehensive mathematical model (ODE) can be developed to predict the heat rejection and temperature drop by considering the physical properties as constant (at an average temperature between inlet and outlet) to simplify the equations. The changes in all water physical properties (density, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity of water) within the SWME operating range $\left(5-30{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ are small. Although water vapor pressure is a strong function of temperature (Fig. S2), the analytical algebraic solution assumes the vapor pressure can be evaluated at the average temperature along SWME fiber, $\left(T_{\text {in }}+T_{\text {out }}\right) / 2$. The algebraic solution thus obtained is expected to possess greater error at higher inlet temperatures and membrane structure parameters, but it can provide a quick tool to predict the thermal performance of the SWME module without the computational rigour of the more accurate ODE model.

ChatGPT figure/image summary: The provided image appears to show data plots from a scientific paper or technical document. Specific content cannot be discussed without seeing the image, but based on the provided contextual information, these plots likely illustrate experimental data and model predictions related to a study of thermal performance in a membrane distillation system, possibly for space applications. The plots might show variables like heat rejection, mass of water vaporized, outlet liquid water temperature, lumen side pressure drop as functions of other parameters such as inlet water temperature, membrane structure parameter ($S_p$), and shell side pressure ($P_{\text{shell}}$). These types of plots are used to understand the behavior of the system under different operating conditions which could relate to applications like temperature regulation of spacesuits or thermal management systems in space environments.)

ChatGPT figure/image summary: The first image appears to be a 3-dimensional (3D) surface plot along with its corresponding contour plot in Fig. 7 from the provided context. The image illustrates:

(a) A 3D surface plot of the Sweating Manikin (SWME) outlet water temperature as a function of inlet water temperature and membrane structure parameter (S P). The outlet water temperature is represented on the vertical axis, and it varies depending on the inlet water temperature and the membrane structure parameter, which are represented on the two horizontal axes. The colors on the surface plot presumably indicate different temperature ranges.
(b) A 2-dimensional (2D) contour plot that seems to correspond to the surface plot above. This plot shows lines representing different constant outlet temperatures based on varying inlet water temperatures and membrane structure parameters, allowing easy identification of conditions to achieve a targeted outlet temperature, for instance, \(10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\).

Both plots are devised to show how changing the inlet water temperature and the overall membrane structure parameter \(S_{P}\) can affect the performance of the SWME system, specifically the outlet water temperature, with a fixed shell side pressure of 7 torr. This information is critical for engineers and scientists who are interested in the thermal management of systems, possibly in applications like space suits or other similar areas where cooling is essential for operation under variable temperature conditions.)

Fig. 7. (a) 3-dimensional (3D) surface plot of SWME outlet water temperature as a function of inlet water temperature and membrane structure parameter (SP) and (b) corresponding contour plot showing different outlet temperature line for inlet water temperature and SP. For current SWME module: number of fibers is 27,900 , inlet water mass flow rate is $91 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{h}$.

mass of water vaporized, outlet temperature and lumen side pressure drop as a function of membrane structure parameter, $S p$ for shell side pressre of 7 torr and inlet water temperature of $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Heat rejection increases with increasing $S p$, but the algebraic model overpredicts the values for high $S p$.

The temperature distribution along the fiber is plotted in Fig. S11 which shows $T_{\text {avg }}$ is higher $\left(12.2{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ for the algebraic model than the ODE model $\left(11.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. This leads to overprediction of water evaporation and heat rejection. Heat rejection and temperature drop along the fiber as a function of inlet water temperature also show that model prediction error increases with increasing inlet temperature (Fig. 8). Nonetheless, the error in predicting outlet temperature, (Tout ${ }_{\text {ODE }}$ - Tout $_{\text {algebraic }}$ )/ Tout $_{\mathrm{ODE}}$, is $<10 \%$ for inlet temperatures less than $8{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\subsection*{4.5. Role of particulates, contaminants and foulants in lumen water}

Fouling by scaling or particulate deposition is one of the major reasons for performance degradation during membrane distillation. Fouling also may be an issue for the SWME. Polypropylene (PP) hollow fiber membranes have shown $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ scaling and significant water flux

ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows two graphical plots comparing the performance of an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model against an algebraic model for a Sweeping Gas Membrane Evaporation (SWME) module. Both plots portray the response of the system to changes in inlet water temperature, with membrane structure parameter (Sp) and shell side pressure (Pshell) kept constant.

Plot (a) depicts heat rejection, measured in watts, as a function of the inlet water temperature ranging from around 5°C to 35°C. Both the ODE and algebraic models show an increase in heat rejection with rising inlet water temperature, with the algebraic model slightly overpredicting the values compared to the ODE model.

Plot (b) illustrates the outlet water temperature, again as a function of inlet water temperature within the same range. Both the ODE and algebraic models demonstrate a rise in outlet water temperature with increasing inlet water temperature, with the algebraic model exhibiting a consistent overprediction compared to the ODE model across the temperature range.

The model parameters are specified in the legends within the plots, indicating a shell side pressure (Pshell) of 7 torr and a membrane structure parameter (Sp) of 1.04x10^-4. The graphical data suggests the algebraic model, while generally alignive with the ODE model, tends to overestimate performance metrics for the given conditions.)

reduction with tap water in membrane distillation process [34,35]. Similar contaminant precipitation and scaling may occur in the SWME loop as metal ions and other contaminants in the feed are concentrated during operation. Adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on silica particulate aggregates was also reported to reduce vapor flux sharply [36]. The effects of particulates in the membrane pore can be multifaceted, from pore blocking to reduction in pore size. Fig. 9 illustrates the effect of reducing pore size by a factor of two on heat rejection. A dramatic decrease occurs over the range of inlet temperatures considered. However, the dependence of heat rejection on changing pore size is approximately linear. Fig. 9b also suggests the "reduction in heat flux" (heat flux ratio) is a linear function of inlet $\mathrm{T}$.

Physical processes such as fouling can lead to $S_{P}$ reduction and a concomitant reduction in thermal performance that can cause system failure. For example, a change is $\pm 5 \%$ is the $S_{P}$ value cause a $\pm 3 \%$ change in the temperature drop of SWME module. If only pore diameter reduces due to deposition (most probably at the pore openings), $S_{P}$ should decrease linearly. However, a reduction of pore size will also lower porosity. For example, a $10 \%$ reduction in $\underline{d}_{p}$ will cause $19 \%$ reduction in surface porosity and a net reduction of $27 \%$ in $S_{p}$. However, if some small pores are blocked completely only $\varphi_{\mathrm{P}}$ will be reduced (and corresponding linear reduction in $S_{\mathrm{P}}$ with respect of porosity) without significant $d_{P}$ changes. The combination of small pore blockage and

ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image contains two graphs labeled (a) and (b). Graph (a) shows a plot of heat rejection in watts as a function of inlet water temperature in degrees Celsius. There are two lines on this graph: one is labeled "Regular pore size" and the other is labeled "Half pore diameter," indicating that heat rejection is being compared for two different pore sizes in a membrane. The x-axis represents the inlet water temperature ranging from 5 to 35 degrees Celsius, and the y-axis represents heat rejection from 0 to about 2000 watts. 

Graph (b) shows the ratio of heat rejection when the pore size is halved to that of the regular pore size described as "q_half pore dia./q_Regular pore." The x-axis is the same as in graph (a), showing the inlet water temperature from 5 to 35 degrees Celsius. The y-axis shows the ratio of heat rejection, which ranges from 0.5 to just under 0.7 as temperature increases.

The graphs are intended to illustrate how a reduction in pore size due to factors like scaling or fouling can impact heat rejection in the context of a water treatment system described as SWME, presumably a membrane distillation system, at a shell side pressure of 7 torr and a specific structure parameter (SP) for the regular pore size.)

Effect of pore size reduction by scaling or fouling on SWME heat rejection as a function of inlet water temperature: (a) heat rejection when pore size is reduced by half compared to regular pore size and (b) ratio of heat rejection when pore size is halved versus regular pore size. $\mathrm{P}_{\text {shell }}=7$ torr and $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{P}}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}$ for regular pore size.

ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image consists of a set of data visualizations related to the properties of a membrane used in a Seawater Membrane Evaporator (SWME) system. These visualizations likely stem from a scientific paper discussing the effects of pore size, water temperature, and contaminants on the performance of the SWME system.

Fig. 10 presents:

a) A 3D surface plot demonstrating the relationship between the liquid entry pressure (LEP) of a membrane as affected by the contact angle and average pore diameter across different water surface tension values (denoted by $\gamma_L$ ranging from 40 to 70 mN/m). The graph depicts how the LEP varies with these factors, giving insight into how the capillary properties of the membrane change.

b) To e) A series of contour plots at various fixed water surface tensions (70, 60, 50, and 40 mN/m respectively), each showing contour lines that likely represent different levels of LEP. These plots provide a two-dimensional view of how the LEP changes systematically with the contact angle and average pore diameter specific to each surface tension value.

Each plot is annotated with contour lines, possibly indicating consistent LEP values in different conditions. For instance, in the plots from (b) to (e), we see the spread of contour lines over the axis of "Average pore diameter" and "Contact angle (degrees)" which suggests how the LEP is influenced by the interaction of these two variables under the given water surface tension. The color bar in the 3D plot correlates with a numerical LEP value, offering a visual representation of pressure thresholds needed to overcome capillary forces within the membrane pores.

The aim of these visualizations is likely to aid the understanding of how the SWME system's efficiency can be impacted by physical membrane characteristics, which is relevant for optimization and troubleshooting of desalination or separation processes.)

Fig. 10. (a) 3D surface plots of liquid entry pressure (LEP) as a function of the contact angle and average pore diameter at different water surface tension ( $\gamma_{L}=$ $40-70 \mathrm{mN} / \mathrm{m}$ ) and contour plots showing different LEP lines for (b) $\gamma_{L}=70 \mathrm{mN} / \mathrm{m}$, (c) $\gamma_{L}=60 \mathrm{mN} / \mathrm{m}$, (d) $\gamma_{L}=50 \mathrm{mN} / \mathrm{m}$, and (e) $\gamma_{L}=40 \mathrm{mN} / \mathrm{m}$. Geometric factor was considered 1.0 in these figures (cylindrical pores).
