Fig. 7. (a) 3-dimensional (3D) surface plot of SWME outlet water temperature as a function of inlet water temperature and membrane structure parameter (SP) and (b) corresponding contour plot showing different outlet temperature line for inlet water temperature and SP. For current SWME module: number of fibers is 27,900 , inlet water mass flow rate is $91 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{h}$.

mass of water vaporized, outlet temperature and lumen side pressure drop as a function of membrane structure parameter, $S p$ for shell side pressre of 7 torr and inlet water temperature of $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Heat rejection increases with increasing $S p$, but the algebraic model overpredicts the values for high $S p$.

The temperature distribution along the fiber is plotted in Fig. S11 which shows $T_{\text {avg }}$ is higher $\left(12.2{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ for the algebraic model than the ODE model $\left(11.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. This leads to overprediction of water evaporation and heat rejection. Heat rejection and temperature drop along the fiber as a function of inlet water temperature also show that model prediction error increases with increasing inlet temperature (Fig. 8). Nonetheless, the error in predicting outlet temperature, (Tout ${ }_{\text {ODE }}$ - Tout $_{\text {algebraic }}$ )/ Tout $_{\mathrm{ODE}}$, is $<10 \%$ for inlet temperatures less than $8{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\subsection*{4.5. Role of particulates, contaminants and foulants in lumen water}

Fouling by scaling or particulate deposition is one of the major reasons for performance degradation during membrane distillation. Fouling also may be an issue for the SWME. Polypropylene (PP) hollow fiber membranes have shown $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ scaling and significant water flux

reduction with tap water in membrane distillation process [34,35]. Similar contaminant precipitation and scaling may occur in the SWME loop as metal ions and other contaminants in the feed are concentrated during operation. Adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on silica particulate aggregates was also reported to reduce vapor flux sharply [36]. The effects of particulates in the membrane pore can be multifaceted, from pore blocking to reduction in pore size. Fig. 9 illustrates the effect of reducing pore size by a factor of two on heat rejection. A dramatic decrease occurs over the range of inlet temperatures considered. However, the dependence of heat rejection on changing pore size is approximately linear. Fig. 9b also suggests the "reduction in heat flux" (heat flux ratio) is a linear function of inlet $\mathrm{T}$.

Physical processes such as fouling can lead to $S_{P}$ reduction and a concomitant reduction in thermal performance that can cause system failure. For example, a change is $\pm 5 \%$ is the $S_{P}$ value cause a $\pm 3 \%$ change in the temperature drop of SWME module. If only pore diameter reduces due to deposition (most probably at the pore openings), $S_{P}$ should decrease linearly. However, a reduction of pore size will also lower porosity. For example, a $10 \%$ reduction in $\underline{d}_{p}$ will cause $19 \%$ reduction in surface porosity and a net reduction of $27 \%$ in $S_{p}$. However, if some small pores are blocked completely only $\varphi_{\mathrm{P}}$ will be reduced (and corresponding linear reduction in $S_{\mathrm{P}}$ with respect of porosity) without significant $d_{P}$ changes. The combination of small pore blockage and
