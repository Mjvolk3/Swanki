during spacewalks

Most past studies of VMD focus on the production of potable water from saline solutions, which is usually performed at relatively high temperatures $\left(30-80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ [17]. Energy efficiency is a key issue in VMD [18] but past work has not focused on thermal performance and characterizing the dependence of performance on membrane properties and operating conditions, which is key in design and operation of SWME operation. A comprehensive thermal performance model also is needed to analyze other advanced hollow fiber membrane applications like low temperature concentration of expensive biomolecules or foodstuffs where lyophilization is not suitable [19].

Performance metrics critical to SWME application include outlet water temperature, heat rejection, and rate of water loss per unit heat rejection. Lumen-side pressure drop and vapor flow rate across the membrane are important as they provide insight into undesirable scenarios such as bursting and water leakage or weeping through the pores. A comprehensive mathematical model that can predict thermal performance as a function of water inlet conditions and membrane parameters (pore size and shape, porosity, tortuosity etc.) is of utmost importance. However, modeling is complicated by several factors (e.g., low pressure evaporation of water, pore non-uniformity, difficulties in measuring tortuosity, maintaining sufficient porosity without compromising structural integrity etc.) and an unavoidable long term performance deterioration due to particulate, contaminant, and foulant build-up in the system $[20-22]$.

The VMD modeling literature has relied predominantly on arithmetic approaches with algebraic equations [16,23]. Recently, Kim et al. [17] reported a model for VMD with differential mass and energy balances, in which they estimated the vapor flux by fitting the model with experimental data. Zhang et al. [16] used the Knudsen diffusion flux equation with a single membrane transport parameter (heretofore referred to as the "membrane structure parameter") and used gas permeation to estimate the parameter experimentally. However, the prediction of thermal performance (heat rejection and temperature) by the VMD model was not explored in both studies.

Here, we develop a model for the NASA SWME unit using a differential mass and energy balance approach. The model explicitly includes the temperature dependence of all water physical properties (water latent heat of vaporization, heat capacity, vapor pressure, density, and viscosity). Membrane vapor flux is calculated using Knudsen diffusion (based on Knudsen number) and the lumen-side convective heat transfer is calculated from the Nusselt correlation for laminar flow in circular flow channels. The lumen-side pressure drop is estimated from the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The membrane structure parameter is determined by fitting predicted heat rejection values to the experimental SWME values reported by Bue et al. [24].

In contrast to various VMD publications, which are mainly explored for water desalination, our paper advances the science of membranebased cooling of water. Quantification of the role of input process and driving force variables are performed, as well as membrane properties through fundamental mass and heat transfer equations. In addition to the elegant spacesuit applications, one can apply this concept for low temperature separation and concentration of heat sensitive materials. The model is used to evaluate the effect of membrane structure parameter, porosity, pore diameter and tortuosity on heat rejection, temperature drop and lumen side pressure drop. Additionally, the
