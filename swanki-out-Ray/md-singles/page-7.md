temperature hollow fiber applications

In addition to membrane structure parameter and shell side pressure, inlet water temperature strongly influences thermal performance. Heat rejection, total mass of water vaporized, outlet water temperature and lumen side pressure drop as a function of inlet water temperature for \(\mathrm{P}_{\text {shell }}=7\) torr are shown in Fig. 6. As expected, heat rejection and mass of water vaporized increase with inlet water temperature for all values of \(S_{P}\) due to increased driving force for vapor flux. Outlet water temperature also increases with inlet water temperature, however for high value of \(S_{P}\left(=6 \times 10^{-4}\right)\) the effect is minimal. Under these conditions, outlet temperature never decreases below \(6{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\), at which temperature the vapor pressure of water is 7 torr. For \(\mathrm{P}_{\text {shell }}=7\) torr (atmospheric pressure at Mars), inlet temperatures below \(6{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) will not produce any cooling. However, in the moon, where atmospheric pressure is 0 torr, very low inlet water temperature is also feasible. The lumen side pressure drop is very small compared to the inlet water pressure ( 1.2 bar). At 0.5 torr (data not shown), heat rejection and mass of water vaporized increase with increasing temperature for all values of \(S_{P}\). However, for higher values of \(S p\) there is no increase in heat rejection or mass of water vaporized with increasing \(S_{\mathrm{P}}\), consistent with Fig. 5, and the outlet temperature remains close to \(0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) for higher \(S_{\mathrm{P}}\) values.

Another important inlet variable is the liquid water mass flow rate, which gives us the indication of blockage or bursting in the lumen side. Fig. S8 in the Supplementary information shows heat rejection and outlet water temperature as a function of inlet water flow rate at \(25{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) and \(S_{P}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}\) for different shell side pressure. Outlet water temperature and heat rejection both decrease with decreasing water flow rate as there is less water to cool and temperature drops rapidly.

\subsection*{4.4. Evaluation of conditions for finding fixed lumen outlet water temperature}

For nominal conditions, the anticipated heat load for a spacewalk is around \(350 \mathrm{~W}(300 \mathrm{~W}\) from the astronaut's body and \(50 \mathrm{~W}\) from the electronics) [33]. The nominal inlet water temperature is around \(17{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) and targeted outlet temperature is \(10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\). From Fig. 5, when \(T_{i n}=20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\), the adjusted membrane parameter \(\left(S_{p}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}\right.\), obtained from fitting SWME experimental thermal performance data) results in \(T_{\text {out }}=\) \(13{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) for \(P_{\text {shell }}=7\) torr, which is higher than targeted \(10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\). Outlet temperature and heat rejection plots for lower \(T_{\text {in }}\) are shown in the Supplementary Information (Fig. S9). When \(T_{i n}=17{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, S_{P}=1.04 \times\) \(10^{-4}\) results in \(T_{\text {out }}=11.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) for \(P_{\text {shell }}=7\) torr, which is higher than targeted \(10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\). However, heat rejection is \(556 \mathrm{~W}\) for \(P_{\text {shell }}=7\) torr, which is higher than nominal heat load ( \(350 \mathrm{~W}\) ), and a reduction of \(44 \% \mathrm{~S}_{\mathrm{p}}\) can be tolerated to maintain \(360 \mathrm{~W}\) heat rejection. When \(T_{\text {in }}=13.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, S_{P}=\) \(1.04 \times 10^{-4}\) results in \(T_{\text {out }}=10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) for \(P_{\text {shell }}=7\) torr, which is exactly the outlet temperature desired. For \(T_{\text {in }}=13.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\), heat rejection is also 355 \(\mathrm{W}\) for \(P_{\text {shell }}=7\) torr, at that point any reduction in \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{p}}\) will results in increase in outlet temperature due to low heat rejection.

Fig. 7a illustrates the dependence of outlet water temperature (Tout) on inlet water temperature and membrane structure parameter \((S P)\) as a color heat map for a shell pressure of 7 torr. Clearly, outlet water temperature increases with both inlet water temperature and reduction of \(S P\). The corresponding contour plot is provided in Fig. 7b. Using the contour plots, combination of inlet water temperature, \(S P\) and Pshell can be chosen for a targeted outlet water temperature (for example \(10{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) ).

Evaluation of Approximate Algebraic Solution:

An approximate algebraic solution of the comprehensive mathematical model (ODE) can be developed to predict the heat rejection and temperature drop by considering the physical properties as constant (at an average temperature between inlet and outlet) to simplify the equations. The changes in all water physical properties (density, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity of water) within the SWME operating range \(\left(5-30{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\) are small. Although water vapor pressure is a strong function of temperature (Fig. S2), the analytical algebraic solution assumes the vapor pressure can be evaluated at the average temperature along SWME fiber, \(\left(T_{\text {in }}+T_{\text {out }}\right) / 2\). The algebraic solution thus obtained is expected to possess greater error at higher inlet temperatures and membrane structure parameters, but it can provide a quick tool to predict the thermal performance of the SWME module without the computational rigour of the more accurate ODE model.
