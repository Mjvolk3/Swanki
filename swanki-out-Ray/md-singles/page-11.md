tolerable to maintain nominal heat load at 7 torr (Martian surface atmospheric pressure). The critical failure modes are discussed based on the model analysis and results. As an example, \(1 \%\) of fiber bursting/ leakage will lead to an additional \(3.6 \mathrm{~kg}\) water loss from the SWME system, which will reduce spacewalk activity to only \(1-2 \mathrm{~h}\). The work delivers tremendous advancement in the field of hollow fiber-based membrane applications by providing a mathematical framework to analyze and predict critical process parameters and the effects of contaminants and foulants on thermal performances. A future application of the model and analysis will be to predict hollow fiber-based membrane separation performance following concentration and purification of biomolecules at lower temperature from dilute aqueous solution.
