\subsection*{4.2. Estimation of structure parameter and model validation}

Only Knudsen diffusion through the pores is considered to model vapor transport through the membrane pores based on the calculated Knudsen number as a function of pore temperature for different pore diameters (see Fig. S5 in Supplementary information). For pore diameters up to \(400 \mathrm{~nm}\) and pore temperatures of \(40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\), the Knudsen number is well above the threshold for Knudsen diffusion ( \(K n>1.0\) ), so the vapor mass flux is estimated using the Knudsen diffusion equation (Eq. (5)).

Pore diameter, porosity, membrane thickness and tortuosity are lumped together in the overall membrane structure parameter ( \(S_{P}=\) \(\frac{d_{p} \varphi_{p}}{\delta \tau}\) ) in the flux equation. Using the manufacturer reported values for the HF-SWME \(\left(d_{P}=40 \mathrm{~nm}, \varphi_{P}=40 \%\right.\) with \(\delta=40 \mu \mathrm{m}\) and \(\tau=1.0\) (if pores are straight)), \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{P}}\) is \(4.0 \times 10^{-4}\). Although pore diameter of the membrane (HF-SWME) was measured and found close to manufacturer reported values (both lumen and shell side) [25], nitrogen adsorption gives a porosity of \(24 \%\) and tortuosity was not verified. However, model predictions can be compared to experimental thermal performance data to obtain the best fit value of \(S_{P}\). Heat rejection values over a range of inlet temperatures reported by NASA for a hollow fiber module of \(18 \mathrm{~cm}\) length, 14,300 fibers with fully open backpressure valve (Bue et al. [24]) are used for the comparison and model validation. Using a \(S_{P}\) value of \(4.0 \times 10^{-4}\), the model overpredicts heat rejection by a factor of two (Fig. 3a). The value of \(S_{P}\) that best fits the data is \(1.04 \times 10^{-4}\) with a \(\mathrm{R}^{2}\) value of \(0.9965 . S_{P}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}\) provides the best fit and the error in heat rejection is only \(0.3 \%\). Using \(\mathrm{d}_{\mathrm{p}}=42 \mathrm{~nm}\) (shell surface) and \(46 \mathrm{~nm}\) (lumen surface), \(\varphi_{\mathrm{P}}=24 \%\) (measured by nitrogen adsorption [25]), and \(\delta=40 \mu \mathrm{m}\) provides \(\tau=2.44\) and 2.67 , respectively, for \(S_{P}=1.04 \times\) \(10^{-4}\). Note that both values are very close to the previously reported \(\tau=\) 2.5 for polypropylene membrane hollow fibers [5,30]. For \(S_{P}=1.04 \times\) \(10^{-4}\), model predictions of heat rejection are in excellent agreement with experimental data for the range of feed temperatures and shell pressures reported indicating robustness of the model in hollow fiber membrane applications.

The model was also validated by the experimental vapor flux reported by Sun et al. (2014) [31] for PVDF membranes with the reported membrane properties: average pore size, porosity and membrane permeability (Fig. S6a in the Supplementary Materials). Model predicted vapor flux values are similar to the experimental flux values except for \(d_{P}=0.282 \mu \mathrm{m}\) and inlet water temperature of \(80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\). The agreement is remarkable despite a very non-uniform pore structure with large macrovoids introduced by the phase inversion process used to form the membranes. Model estimated temperature drop is shown in Fig. S6b, which shows a low temperature drop due to high water flow rate in the lumen side.

\subsection*{4.3. Model prediction results for new generation SWME module}

Using the best fit value for the HF-SWME membrane structure factor, the model was used to evaluate the current SWME module design containing 27,900 fibers and an active fiber length of \(11.9 \mathrm{~cm}\) (see Supplementary Information for other membrane input parameters). Model predicted liquid water temperature as a function of dimensionless length is shown in Fig. 4a and b for shell side pressure of 0.5 torr and 7 torr (Mars atmospheric pressure), respectively. For 0.5 torr shell side pressure, at high.

\(S_{P}\left(4.0 \times 10^{-4}\right)\), the temperature approaches \(0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) at the midpoint of the fiber length whereas the temperatures remain above zero for \(S_{P}=\) \(1.04 \times 10^{-4}\). Although a negative water temperature can occur for water evaporation at low pressure [32], the lumen side pressure is \(>1\) bar and a negative temperature will form ice which should be avoided in the SWME application. Note that calculations were stopped when the temperature dropped to zero. For 7 torr shell side pressure (Fig. 4b), the outlet water temperature was \(7.2{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) and \(12.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) for \(S_{P}=4.0 \times 10^{-4}\) and \(1.04 \times 10^{-4}\), respectively.

For 0.5 torr shell side pressure and \(S_{P}=4.0 \times 10^{-4}\), the water vapor flux is very high and water temperature drops rapidly as a result. Fig. S7 in Supporting Information shows corresponding water vapor mass flow rate through the pores for \(T_{\text {in }}=20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\). For \(P_{\text {shell }}=0.5\) torr (Fig. S7a) and high \(S_{P}\), water vapor mass flow rate is very high near the entrance but drops rapidly as the water cools. Conversely, for \(P_{\text {shell }}=7\) torr (Fig. S7b), the vapor mass flow rate is high near the entrance for high \(S_{P}\) but drops below the value for

\(S_{P}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}\) around \(\xi=0.67\)

Fig. 5 shows heat rejection, total mass of water vaporized, liquid water temperature at the outlet and lumen side pressure drops as a function of overall membrane structure parameter for different shell side pressure at \(\mathrm{T}_{\text {in }}=20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\). Heat rejection and mass of water vaporized increase as either the structural parameter increases or shell pressure decreases (Fig. 5a and b). However, for \(\mathrm{P}_{\text {shell }}=0.5\) torr and 3 torr, heat rejection reaches a maximum at a certain \(S_{\mathrm{P}}\), after which there is no
