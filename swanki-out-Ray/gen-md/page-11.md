## What is the effect of 1% fiber bursting/leakage on water loss and spacewalk duration?

A 1% fiber bursting/leakage will lead to an additional $3.6$ kg water loss from the SWME system, reducing spacewalk activity to only 1-2 hours.

## Explain the impact of contaminants and foulants on thermal performance in the context of hollow fiber-based membrane applications.

Contaminants and foulants adversely affect thermal performance by clogging pores and reducing the overall efficiency of heat transfer, hindering the process functionality.

## Given that $C_p$ represents water heat capacity, express it in proper units and context.

The heat capacity of water $C_p$ is expressed as $ Joules/kg/K $ and is crucial for understanding the energy required to change the temperature of water in thermal processes.

## Calculate the mass flux of vapor ($J_k$) through the pores if $ \dot{m}_{\text{in}} $ is known.

Given $\dot{m}_{\text{in}}$ (the inlet mass flow rate of water) and knowing that $J_k$ stands for the mass flux of vapor through the pores, one can use relationship:

$$ J_k = \frac{\dot{m}_{\text{in}}}{A_p \cdot n} $$

where $A_p$ is the area of one pore opening and $n$ is the number of pores per unit length of fiber.

## What purpose do the Antoine constants (A, B, C) serve in the mathematical model?

The Antoine constants (A, B, C) are used to calculate the vapor pressure of a substance, which is essential for modeling phase changes and predicting separation performance in membrane applications.

## Using $P_{\text{vapor}}$ (water vapor pressure) and $P_{\text{lumen}}$ (lumen side liquid water pressure), describe the importance of pressure differentials in membrane processes.

Pressure differentials between $P_{\text{vapor}}$ and $P_{\text{lumen}}$ drive the separation process in hollow fiber-based membranes by affecting vapor transport through pores.
