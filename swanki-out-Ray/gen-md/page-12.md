### Card 2

## What is the significance of the parameter $\delta_{L}$ in membrane technologies?

The parameter $\delta_{L}$ represents the liquid entry length in the membrane and is measured in meters (m). This length is crucial as it determines how far liquid can penetrate into the membrane before transitioning to vapor. It affects the efficiency and performance of separation processes like distillation.

### Card 3

## Explain the variable $\Delta P$ and provide its unit.

$\Delta P$ represents the pressure drop across the membrane. This parameter is measured in Pascals (Pa).

Understanding $\Delta P$ is vital for evaluating the performance of a membrane, as it influences the driving force for mass transfer and affects flux rates through the membrane.

### Card 5

## What does $\tau$ represent in the context of membrane properties and why is it important?

$\tau$ represents the tortuosity of a membrane. Tortuosity is a dimensionless quantity that indicates the complexity of the path fluid must take through the porous structure of the membrane. It directly affects the resistance to flow and mass transfer within the membrane.

### Card 6

## State the mathematical relationship between the variables for water latent heat of vaporization and provide its unit.

Water latent heat of vaporization is denoted as $\lambda_{v}$ and is measured in Joules per kilogram (J/kg). This value specifies the amount of energy required to convert a unit mass of water from liquid to vapor without a temperature change.

$$
