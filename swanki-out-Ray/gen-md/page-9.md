## What effect does pore size reduction have on SWME heat rejection as the inlet water temperature changes?

The paper states that the heat rejection decreases when the pore size is reduced by half compared to the regular pore size.

## When pore size is reduced by half, what is the effect on the ratio of heat rejection versus regular pore size?

The ratio of heat rejection when pore size is halved is shown to be different from that of the regular pore size.

## Given $P_{\text{shell}} = 7$ torr and $S_P = 1.04 \times 10^{-4}$ for regular pore size, what values could you expect when pore size is reduced by scaling or fouling?

The values of heat rejection, $\mathrm{P}_{\text{shell}}$, and $\mathrm{S}_p$ may alter in response to pore size changes, indicating variations in performance metrics.

## How does liquid entry pressure (LEP) change with respect to the contact angle and average pore diameter at different water surface tensions in the given study?

The liquid entry pressure (LEP) is functionally dependent on the contact angle and pore diameter, varying with the water surface tension $\gamma_{L}$.

$$
\text{LEP} = f(\theta, d, \gamma_{L})
$$

## Explain the equation $\gamma_{L} = 40-70\mathrm{mN}/\mathrm{m}$ mentioned in the text about LEP?

The equation $\gamma_{L} = 40-70\mathrm{mN}/\mathrm{m}$ represents the range of water surface tension $\gamma_{L}$ considered in the study, influencing LEP values.

## What geometric factor was assumed in the figures related to LEP and why?

The geometric factor was considered 1.0 for cylindrical pores, simplifying the analysis by standardizing pore shapes.
