Here are six cards focusing on the scientific and mathematical concepts discussed in the provided chunk of the paper:

---

## How does the inlet water temperature affect heat rejection and the mass of water vaporized in a SWME module?

Increasing the inlet water temperature increases both heat rejection and the mass of water vaporized due to the increased driving force for vapor flux.

## What is the effect of inlet water temperature on outlet water temperature for a high membrane structure parameter $S_{P}$?

For high values of $S_{P}\left(=6 \times 10^{-4}\right)$, the effect on outlet water temperature is minimal. The outlet temperature never decreases below $6{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, where the vapor pressure of water is 7 torr.

## Explain the pressure condition at which inlet temperatures below $6{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ will not produce any cooling in the SWME module.

For $\mathrm{P}_{\text {shell }}=7$ torr (atmospheric pressure on Mars), inlet temperatures below $6{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ will not produce any cooling because the minimum vapor pressure at this temperature is 7 torr.

## What is the nominal heat load for a spacewalk and how does it relate to the SWME module's performance?

The nominal heat load for a spacewalk is around $350 \mathrm{~W}$. The SWME module must handle this heat load to maintain the desired outlet water temperature, which is typically around $10{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

## Describe the algebraic approximation for predicting heat rejection and temperature drop in the SWME module.

The algebraic solution approximates the comprehensive mathematical model by considering physical properties as constant at an average temperature between the inlet and outlet.

$$
T_{\text {avg}} = \frac{T_{\text {in }} + T_{\text {out }}}{2}
$$

This simplifies the equations, but the approximation has greater error at higher inlet temperatures and membrane structure parameters.

## Using the contour plots from the study, how can one choose the appropriate combination of inlet water temperature, $S_{P}$, and $P_{\text {shell}}$ for a targeted outlet water temperature?

The contour plots allow for the selection of a combination of inlet water temperature, membrane structure parameter $S_{P}$, and shell pressure $P_{\text {shell}}$ to achieve a targeted outlet water temperature (e.g., $10{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$).
