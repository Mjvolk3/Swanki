## What is the typical temperature range for the production of potable water from saline solutions in VMD processes?

Most past studies of VMD focus on the production of potable water from saline solutions, which is usually performed at relatively high temperatures:

## Why is energy efficiency considered a key issue in VMD processes?

Energy efficiency is a key issue in VMD because it directly impacts the operational costs and sustainability of the process. Efficient energy use ensures that less input energy is required to produce the desired output, making the process more economically and environmentally viable.

## Explain the significance of the "membrane structure parameter" in evaluating VMD processes.

The "membrane structure parameter" is critical in evaluating VMD processes as it encapsulates important characteristics like pore size, shape, porosity, and tortuosity. Zhang et al. [16] used gas permeation to estimate this parameter experimentally. Accurate determination of this parameter helps in understanding the membrane's behavior and its contributions to performance metrics such as heat rejection and vapor flux.

## Describe the factors contributing to the complexity of modeling VMD processes.

Modeling VMD processes is complicated due to:

- Low pressure evaporation of water,
- Pore non-uniformity,
- Difficulties in measuring tortuosity,
- Maintaining sufficient porosity without compromising structural integrity,
- Long-term performance deterioration due to particulate, contaminant, and foulant build-up.

## What equation is used in the NASA SWME unit model to estimate the lumen-side pressure drop, and why is this important?

The lumen-side pressure drop in the NASA SWME unit model is estimated using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. This estimation is vital as it influences the flow dynamics within the system and can impact membrane performance and system integrity.

$$
\Delta P = \frac{8 \mu L Q}{\pi r^4}
$$

Where:
- $\Delta P$ is the pressure drop,
- $\mu$ is the fluid viscosity,
- $L$ is the length of the tube,
- $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate,
- $r$ is the radius of the tube.

Understanding pressure drop helps in preventing undesirable scenarios such as membrane bursting or water leakage.
