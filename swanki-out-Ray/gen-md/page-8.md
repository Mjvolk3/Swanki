### Card 1

## Explain the relationship between membrane structure parameter (SP) and heat rejection in the SWME process.

The heat rejection in the SWME process increases with increasing membrane structure parameter, denoted as $SP$. However, it should be noted that the algebraic model tends to overpredict the values for high $SP$. Specifically, the error in predicting outlet temperature rises with an increase in inlet temperature.

### Card 2

## What is the error in predicting outlet temperature for inlet temperatures less than $8{ }^{\circ}C$ using the algebraic model in the SWME process? 

The error in predicting outlet temperature $((T_{\text{out ODE}} - T_{\text{out algebraic}})/T_{\text{out ODE}})$ is less than 10% for inlet temperatures less than $8{ }^{\circ}C$.

### Card 3

## How does fouling by scaling or particulate deposition affect membrane distillation performance?

Fouling by scaling or particulate deposition significantly degrades performance by:

- Scaling e.g., $\text{CaCO}_3$ deposits
- Reducing water flux
- Blocking membrane pores, reducing effective pore size
- Reducing porosity and thus decreasing thermal performance

For example, a $10 \%$ reduction in pore diameter ($d_{p}$) can lower surface porosity by $19 \%$ and reduce the structure parameter $S_{p}$ by $27 \%$.

### Card 4

## Describe the relationship between inlet water temperature and error in the SWME model's temperature predictions.

The model prediction error, especially in outlet temperature prediction, increases with higher inlet water temperatures. The predicted outlet temperature difference $(T_{\text{out ODE}} - T_{\text{out algebraic}})/T_{\text{out ODE}}$, for example, remains less than 10% only for inlet temperatures below $8{ }^{\circ}C$.

### Card 5

## Discuss the effect of reducing pore size on heat rejection in the SWME process.

Reducing the pore size by a factor of two leads to a substantial decrease in heat rejection for the range of inlet temperatures considered. The reduction in heat flux (heat flux ratio) is approximately linear with inlet temperature.

### Card 6

## Explain what happens to thermal performance and system stability when $S_{p}$ is altered by $\pm 5\%$ due to fouling or pore size reduction.

A change of $\pm 5\%$ in $S_{p}$ can cause a $\pm 3\%$ change in the temperature drop of the SWME module. If the pore diameter is primarily reduced without blocking, $S_{p}$ decreases linearly. However, simultaneous blockages in small pores and porosity reduction can cause complex impacts:

- A $10\%$ reduction in pore diameter decreases surface porosity by $19\%$ and reduces $S_{p}$ by $27\%$.
- If small pores are blocked completely, only the porosity $\varphi_P$ reduces, impacting $S_{p}$ linearly with respect to porosity.
