### Card 1

In the context of the Spacesuit Water Membrane Evaporator (SWME), what are the key factors that the mathematical model evaluates to predict failure modes?

%
The mathematical model evaluates the following key factors to predict failure modes in the SWME:

- Heat rejection
- Temperature drop
- Lumen side pressure drop 

These evaluations are performed through the computations of heat and mass balances, convective heat transfer coefficients, and the use of equations like the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for pressure drop.

### Card 2

The mass flux of water vapor through the pores in the SWME is calculated using which type of diffusion?

%
The mass flux of water vapor through the pores in the SWME is calculated using Knudsen diffusion. Knudsen diffusion is relevant when the mean free path of the molecules is comparable to the size of the pores in the membrane.

$$
J = \frac{\epsilon}{\tau} \cdot \frac{D_k}{\delta} \cdot (p_1 - p_2)
$$

where:
- $J$ = mass flux of water vapor
- $\epsilon$ = porosity
- $\tau$ = tortuosity
- $D_k$ = Knudsen diffusion coefficient
- $\delta$ = membrane thickness
- $p_1, p_2$ = pressures at different points

### Card 3

What equation is used to estimate the lumen side pressure drop in the SWME, and what are the main variables involved?

%
The lumen side pressure drop in the SWME is estimated using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:

$$
\Delta P = \frac{8 \mu L Q}{\pi r^4}
$$

where:
- $\Delta P$ = pressure drop
- $\mu$ = dynamic viscosity of the fluid
- $L$ = length of the tube
- $Q$ = volumetric flow rate
- $r$ = radius of the tube

This equation assumes laminar flow conditions within the lumen side of the hollow fiber membrane.

### Card 4

What is the primary operational difference between Vacuum Membrane Distillation (VMD) and the SWME?

%
The primary operational difference between Vacuum Membrane Distillation (VMD) and the SWME is their objective with respect to heat loss and evaporation:

- **VMD** seeks to minimize heat loss due to evaporation while producing a high-quality distillate.
- **SWME** seeks to maximize heat loss through evaporation for the purpose of cooling the water in the lumen side, rather than producing a specific quality of distillate.

### Card 5

What role does a backpressure valve play in the operation of the SWME?

%
In the operation of the SWME, a backpressure valve is used to control the water vapor pressure in the shell of the hollow fiber module. This helps in:

- Regulating the rate of water evaporation
- Controlling the exiting temperature of the liquid water

By adjusting the backpressure valve, the system can manage the thermal control effectively to ensure the astronauts' comfort and safety.

### Card 6

Explain how the Nusselt correlation is utilized in the context of the SWME to calculate convective heat transfer coefficients.

%
The Nusselt correlation is used to calculate convective heat transfer coefficients on the lumen side of the hollow fiber in the SWME. For laminar flow conditions, the Nusselt number ($Nu$) can be related to the convective heat transfer coefficient ($h$) as follows:

$$
Nu = \frac{hD}{k}
$$

where:
- $Nu$ = Nusselt number
- $h$ = convective heat transfer coefficient
- $D$ = characteristic length (e.g., diameter of the lumen)
- $k$ = thermal conductivity of the fluid

The Nusselt number for laminar flow in circular tubes can be approximated by various empirical correlations, such as:

$$
Nu = 3.66
$$

for constant wall temperature. This allows for the calculation of $h$ which is critical for determining overall heat rejection in SWME.
