## Explain the model fitting in Fig. 3(a) for optimizing the overall membrane structure parameter, $S_p$.

The model fitting in Fig. 3(a) involves comparing NASA-reported experimental heat rejection data as a function of inlet water temperature with a fully open backpressure valve. The objective is to optimize the overall membrane structure parameter, $S_p$.

## What does Fig. 3(b) depict in relation to the optimized $S_p$?

Fig. 3(b) shows the model-predicted heat rejection with the optimized membrane structure parameter, $S_p$, alongside the experimental heat rejection as a function of shell side pressure.

## Explain the significance of the variables $\mathrm{P}_{\text{shell }}$ and $\dot{m}_{i n}$ used in Fig. 4.

In Fig. 4, $\mathrm{P}_{\text{shell }}$ represents the shell side pressure, and $\dot{m}_{i n}$ represents the inlet liquid water mass flow rate, which is $91 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{h}$. These parameters are crucial in analyzing the liquid water temperature as a function of dimensionless length for different $\mathrm{S_p}$ values.

## Describe how $\mathrm{Sp}$ values affect liquid water temperature in Fig. 4.

In Fig. 4, different values of $\mathrm{Sp}$ ($4.0 \times 10^{-4}$ and $1.04 \times 10^{-4}$) affect the liquid water temperature as a function of dimensionless length for varying shell side pressures ($0.5$ torr and $7$ torr). Higher $\mathrm{Sp}$ values lead to higher temperature gradients along the dimensionless length of the membrane.

## Discuss the impact of shell side pressure on the outlet temperature as presented in Fig. 5c.

In Fig. 5c, lower shell side pressure results in the outlet temperature approaching $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for higher values of $\mathrm{S_p}$, indicating significant cooling. This shows that optimal shell side pressure and $\mathrm{S_p}$ values must be balanced to attain desired outlet temperatures.

## How does the overall membrane structure parameter $S_p$ influence heat rejection and the mass of water vaporized as illustrated in Fig. 5(a) and 5(b)?

In Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), it's evident that increasing the overall membrane structure parameter $S_p$ leads to an increase in heat rejection and the total mass of water vaporized. This underscores the importance of optimizing $S_p$ for efficient heat transfer and vaporization.
