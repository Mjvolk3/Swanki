### Card 1

Modeling vapor transport through the membrane pores requires consideration of Knudsen diffusion. 

## What equation is used to estimate vapor mass flux, assuming Knudsen diffusion?

The vapor mass flux is estimated using the Knudsen diffusion equation:

$$
J_K = \frac{2}{3} \frac{d_p \varphi_p}{\delta \tau} \left( \frac{\pi}{8 R T} \right)^{1/2} \left( P_1 - P_2 \right)
$$

where:
- $J_K$: Knudsen flux
- $d_p$: pore diameter
- $\varphi_p$: porosity
- $ \delta$: thickness
- $\tau$: tortuosity
- $R$: universal gas constant
- $T$: temperature
- $P_1$, $P_2$: partial pressures

### Card 2

One key property for vapor transport in membranes is the overall membrane structure parameter, denoted $S_{P}$.

## What is the expression for the overall membrane structure parameter $S_{P}$?

The overall membrane structure parameter is given by:

$$
S_{P} = \frac{d_p \varphi_p}{\delta \tau}
$$

where:
- $d_p$: pore diameter
- $\varphi_p$: porosity
- $\delta$: membrane thickness
- $\tau$: tortuosity

By lumping these parameters together, it simplifies the flux equation.

### Card 3

Model validation can be performed by comparing experimental data to modeled predictions.

## What $S_{P}$ value was found to best fit the experimental data and what $\mathrm{R}^{2}$ value does it produce?

The value of $S_{P}$ that best fits the experimental data is:

$$
S_{P} = 1.04 \times 10^{-4}
$$

with an $\mathrm{R}^2$ value of:

$$
0.9965
$$

This suggests a very good fit between the model predictions and the experimental data.

### Card 4

Validation of the model involves comparison with real membrane properties and experimental outcomes.

## For the formula $S_{P} = 1.04 \times 10^{-4}$, which measured values of $d_p$, $\varphi_p$, and $\delta$ were substituted, and what are the resulting $\tau$ values?

Using:
- $d_p = 42 \, \mathrm{nm}$ (shell surface) and $46 \, \mathrm{nm}$ (lumen surface)
- $\varphi_p = 24\%$ (measured by nitrogen adsorption)
- $\delta = 40 \, \mu \mathrm{m}$ 

The resulting $\tau$ values are:
- $\tau = 2.44$ for shell surface
- $\tau = 2.67$ for lumen surface

These values provide close approximation to the previously reported tortuosity for polypropylene membrane hollow fibers.

### Card 5

The model predicts variations in temperatures under different conditions.

## For a shell side pressure of 0.5 torr and $S_{P}=4.0 \times 10^{-4}$, what is the significant result seen halfway down the fiber length?

At halfway down the fiber length, the significant result is:

$$
T \approx 0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

This is a critical observation as the temperature drops rapidly due to water vapor flux. For $S_{P}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}$, temperatures remain above zero, avoiding ice formation which is crucial for SWME applications.

### Card 6

Model predictions can vary with changes in structural parameters and operational conditions.

## For a shell side pressure of 7 torr and $S_{P}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}$, what is the outlet water temperature?

For a shell side pressure of 7 torr:

$$
T_{\text{outlet}} = 12.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

This represents a balance between efficient vapor flux and maintaining a temperature that avoids freezing, which aligns with the operational requirements.
