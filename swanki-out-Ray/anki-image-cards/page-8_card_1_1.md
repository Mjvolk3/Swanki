The key variables depicted in the 3D surface plot are:
1. **Outlet water temperature** (vertical axis)
2. **Inlet water temperature** (one of the horizontal axes)
3. **Membrane structure parameter (SP)** (the other horizontal axis)

## In the 2D contour plot of SWME outlet water temperature, what do the lines represent?

The lines in the 2D contour plot represent different constant outlet water temperatures based on varying inlet water temperatures and membrane structure parameters.
