Graph (a) in Fig. 4 shows the temperature profile for liquid water with a shell side pressure ($P_{\text{shell}}$) of 0.5 torr and an inlet water temperature ($T_{\text{in}}$) of 20°C. The graph compares two overall membrane structure parameters ($S_p$): 

1. $S_p = 4 \times 10^{-4}$
2. $S_p = 1.04 \times 10^{-4}$

The x-axis represents the dimensionless length along the fiber (ξ), ranging from 0 to 1, while the y-axis represents the liquid water temperature in degrees Celsius, ranging from approximately 0 up to 20°C. The temperature curve for $S_p = 4 \times 10^{-4}$ declines more rapidly towards a lower temperature compared to the curve for $S_p = 1.04 \times 10^{-4}$, indicating a more efficient cooling effect.

## How does the liquid water temperature profile in Graph (b) of Fig. 4 differ between the two membrane structure parameters?

Graph (b) in Fig. 4 presents the temperature profile for liquid water with a shell side pressure ($P_{\text{shell}}$) of 7 torr and an inlet water temperature ($T_{\text{in}}$) of 20°C. It compares two overall membrane structure parameters ($S_p$):

1. $S_p = 4 \times 10^{-4}$
2. $S_p = 1.04 \times 10^{-4}$

Similar to Graph (a), the x-axis represents the dimensionless length along the fiber (ξ), ranging from 0 to 1, while the y-axis represents the liquid water temperature in degrees Celsius, ranging from approximately 0 up to 20°C. The curve for $S_p = 4 \times 10^{-4}$ again shows a more rapid decline in temperature compared to the curve for $S_p = 1.04 \times 10^{-4}$, indicating the former is more effective in reducing the water temperature as it moves through the fiber.
