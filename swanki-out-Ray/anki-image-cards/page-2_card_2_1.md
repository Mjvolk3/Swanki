Part (a) of the image is a simplified conceptual diagram of a single hollow fiber in the NASA SWME module. It shows the water flow direction from left to right, indicating:

- Inlet mass flow rate ($\dot{m}_{in}$) and inlet water temperature ($T_{in}$).
- Vapor pressure difference $\Delta P = P_{\mathrm{vapor}} - P_{\mathrm{shell}}$ across the membrane driving water vapor transport.
- Lumen pressure drop ($\Delta P_{\mathrm{lumen}}$).
- Temperature profile along the fiber, including temperatures at the pore mouth ($T_{p}$) and the liquid-vapor interface at the membrane surface ($T_{m}$).

## Describe the function of the differential control volume shown in part (c) of the image.

Part (c) of the image shows a differential control volume for mass and energy balance around the fiber in the NASA SWME module. Water vapor exits the surface, while water enters and exits the control volume. The temperature profile $T(z)$ along the axis of the fiber increases to $T(z+\Delta z)$. This control volume is used to model heat and mass transfer within this fiber segment.
