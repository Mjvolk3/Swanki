Explain the model fitting process illustrated by the graph labeled "Fig. 3(a)".

%

The graph labeled "Fig. 3(a)" depicts model fitting with NASA-reported experimental heat rejection data as a function of inlet water temperature. The process involves optimizing the overall membrane structure parameter $S_p$ with a fully open backpressure valve to match the experimental data taken from Bue et al. This optimization helps improve the model's accuracy in predicting heat rejection based on varying inlet water temperatures.

Describe what is shown in the graph labeled "Fig. 3(b)" and its significance in the context of the study.

%

The graph labeled "Fig. 3(b)" shows model-predicted heat rejection with an optimized structure parameter $S_p$ along with experimental heat rejection as a function of shell side pressure. This comparison validates the model's predictability and demonstrates that the optimized parameter $S_p$ accurately represents the experimental conditions, thus confirming the model's reliability for predicting heat rejection under various shell side pressures.
