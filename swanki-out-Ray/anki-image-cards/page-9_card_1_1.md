Graph (a) demonstrates that reducing the pore size by half results in lower heat rejection compared to the regular pore size. For instance, at an inlet water temperature of 25Â°C, the heat rejection for the regular pore size is approximately 1400 watts, whereas for the halved pore size, it is slightly below 1000 watts.

Graph (b) shows the ratio of heat rejection when the pore size is halved versus regular pore size. The ratio remains below 0.7 across the temperature range, indicating that heat rejection always decreases with reduced pore size.

The variables and conditions stated include:
- The shell side pressure $\mathrm{P}_{\text {shell }}$ is 7 torr.
- The specific structure parameter $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{P}}$ for the regular pore size is $1.04 \times 10^{-4}$.
- The inlet water temperature ranges from 5 to 35 degrees Celsius.
- Comparison between heat rejection of regular pore size versus half pore diameter.
