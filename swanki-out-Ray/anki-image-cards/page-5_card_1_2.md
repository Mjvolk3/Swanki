What is depicted in the SEM images of the hollow fiber for the SWME module (HF-SWME) and what does the scale bar represent?

%

The SEM images show the hollow fiber for a Sweating Manikin (SWME) module with noncircular ellipsoidal pore structures. Panel (a) shows the lumen side surface, panel (b) shows the shell side surface, and panel (c) shows a cross-sectional view. The scale bar indicates that 1.0 $\mu$m is represented by the length of the scale bar.

Describe the differences observed in the pore structures on the lumen side surface and the shell side surface of the hollow fiber for the SWME module (HF-SWME).

%

In the SEM images of the hollow fiber for the SWME module (HF-SWME):
- Panel (a) showing the lumen side surface reveals ellipsoidal, somewhat non-uniform pores on the surface.
- Panel (b) showing the shell side surface shows noncircular pores with slightly different arrangements and shapes compared to the lumen side.
