The SEM images display the following details:

1. **Panel (a)**: Lumen side surface, characterized by ellipsoidal and non-uniform pores on the surface.
2. **Panel (b)**: Shell side surface, also with noncircular pores that are different in shape and arrangement from the lumen side.
3. **Panel (c)**: Cross-sectional view, showing a fibrous internal texture with pores appearing as dark shapes within the material.

The scale bar in each image represents $1.0 \mu \mathrm{m}$.

The three SEM images indicate that the hollow fiber for the SWME module has noncircular ellipsoidal pore structures, with distinct surface characteristics on different sides:

1. **Lumen side surface** (panel a) presents ellipsoidal, non-uniform pores.
2. **Shell side surface** (panel b) shows pores that differ in shape and arrangement compared to the lumen side.
3. **Cross-sectional view** (panel c) reveals a fibrous internal structure with pores appearing as dark shapes.

The scale bar for all images is $1.0 \mu \mathrm{m}$.
