The algebraic solution assumes the vapor pressure can be evaluated at the average temperature along the SWME fiber, given by $\left(T_{\text{in}} + T_{\text{out}}\right) / 2$.

## What limitations might the algebraic solution have for predicting the thermal performance of the SWME module?

The algebraic solution is expected to have greater error at higher inlet temperatures and membrane structure parameters. However, it provides a quick tool for predicting the thermal performance of the SWME module without the computational rigor of a more accurate ODE model.
