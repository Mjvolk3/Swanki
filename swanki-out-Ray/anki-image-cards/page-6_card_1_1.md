Fig. 3 in the study presents two important sub-figures related to the heat rejection performance of an SWME module:

1. **Fig. 3(a)**: It shows the model fitting using NASA reported experimental data for heat rejection as a function of inlet water temperature with a fully open backpressure valve. The goal is to optimize the overall membrane structure parameter, $S_p$.
2. **Fig. 3(b)**: This graph depicts the model-predicted heat rejection with the optimized $S_p$ alongside experimental heat rejection data as a function of shell side pressure.

These figures illustrate the relationship between inlet water temperature and shell side pressure on the heat rejection performance, validating the model's capability to predict heat rejection using optimized membrane structural parameters.

In Fig. 3(a), the highlighted optimization parameter is the overall membrane structure parameter, denoted as $S_p$. The model uses this parameter to fit NASA reported experimental data of heat rejection as a function of the inlet water temperature with a fully open backpressure valve. By optimizing $S_p$, the model aims to accurately represent the experimental heat rejection data, which is crucial for predicting the performance of the SWME module under various operating conditions.
