    How does the Sweat Management Equipment (SWME) module operate and what are some key components?
    
    %
    
    The SWME module processes sweat by managing inputs and driving forces, such as membrane properties. Key components in the SWME module include:
    - BPV motor
    - BPV Assembly
    - Fiber Cartridge with Stainless Steel Frame
    - Housing
    - Inlet/Header
    - Outlet/Header
    - Internal Volume Access Ports
    
    Water enters as "Inlet water (warm)" and exits as "Outlet water (cold)", with vapor flow managed in the system.

    What does the simplified conceptual diagram of a single fiber in the NASA SWME module illustrate?
    
    %
    
    The simplified conceptual diagram of a single fiber illustrates:
    - The direction of the atmospheric pressure ($P_{atm}$)
    - The pressure control valve
    
    This helps to understand the operational principles of a critical component in the SWME system.
