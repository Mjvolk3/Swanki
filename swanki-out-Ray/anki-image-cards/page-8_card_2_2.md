Plot (a) shows that both the ODE and algebraic models predict an increase in heat rejection with rising inlet water temperature, ranging from around 5째C to 35째C. The algebraic model generally overpredicts the heat rejection values compared to the ODE model.

## What are the observed differences in outlet water temperature predictions between the ODE and algebraic models for varying inlet water temperatures?

Plot (b) illustrates that both models show an increase in outlet water temperature with rising inlet water temperature, ranging from around 5째C to 35째C. The algebraic model consistently overestimates the outlet water temperature compared to the ODE model across the temperature range.
