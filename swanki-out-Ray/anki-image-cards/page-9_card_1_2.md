What is the effect of reducing the pore size by half on heat rejection in an SWME system as a function of inlet water temperature?

%

Reducing the pore size by half significantly decreases the heat rejection across various inlet water temperatures in the SWME system. This is evident in the first graph where the heat rejection values are consistently lower for the "Half pore diameter" compared to the "Regular pore size." The reduction is more pronounced at higher inlet temperatures (up to about 2000 watts for regular pore size).

What does graph (b) in Fig. 9 of the given image illustrate regarding the ratio of heat rejection for half pore diameter to regular pore size?

%

Graph (b) illustrates that the ratio of heat rejection for "Half pore diameter" to "Regular pore size" decreases with an increase in inlet water temperature. The ratio ranges from 0.5 to just under 0.7, indicating a substantial drop in efficiency due to the reduction in pore size.
