## How does the simplified conceptual diagram of a single hollow fiber in the NASA SWME module depict the direction and properties of water flow?

The diagram shows water flowing from left to right with the following indicated properties:

- Inlet mass flow rate $(\dot{m}_{\text{in}})$ and inlet water temperature $(T_{\text{in}})$.
- Vapor pressure difference $(\Delta P = P_{\text{vapor}} - P_{\text{shell}})$ across the membrane driving water vapor transport from the lumen to the shell side.
- Pressure drop across the lumen $(\Delta P_{\text{lumen}})$.
- Temperature (T) along the length of the fiber, including the temperatures at the pore mouth $(T_p)$ and at the liquid-vapor interface on the membrane surface $(T_m)$.

## What does the differential control volume in part (c) of the NASA SWME module diagram represent, and how is temperature change along the fiber axis modeled?

The differential control volume in part (c) represents a segment of the fiber used for mass and energy balance analysis. It depicts water vapor flux out from the surface and water inflow and outflow on the left and right sides, respectively. The temperature profile along the fiber axis is noted as $T(z)$, with an increase to $T(z+\Delta z)$ on the right side, illustrating the temperature change along the fiber's length.
