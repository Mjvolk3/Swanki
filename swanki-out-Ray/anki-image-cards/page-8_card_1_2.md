What does the 3D surface plot in Fig. 7(a) represent, and how do the inlet water temperature and membrane structure parameter affect the outlet water temperature?

%

The 3D surface plot in Fig. 7(a) represents the Sweating Manikin (SWME) outlet water temperature as a function of the inlet water temperature and membrane structure parameter (SP). The outlet water temperature, shown on the vertical axis, varies based on the inlet water temperature and SP, depicted on the two horizontal axes. Different color bands indicate varying temperature ranges.

What information does the contour plot in Fig. 7(b) provide about the SWME system's performance?

%

The contour plot in Fig. 7(b) shows lines representing various constant outlet temperatures based on changes in the inlet water temperatures and membrane structure parameters. This plot facilitates the identification of specific conditions to achieve targeted outlet temperatures, essential for thermal management applications.
