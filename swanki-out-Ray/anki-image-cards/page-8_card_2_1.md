Compare the performance outcomes between the ODE and algebraic models for heat rejection and temperature drop in SWME as a function of inlet water temperature.

%

The image presents two plots:
- **Heat Rejection (Plot a)**: Both ODE and algebraic models show increased heat rejection with rising inlet water temperature from approximately 5째C to 35째C. The algebraic model slightly overpredicts heat rejection compared to the ODE model.
- **Outlet Water Temperature (Plot b)**: Both models indicate a rise in outlet water temperature with increasing inlet temperature, with the algebraic model consistently overpredicting compared to the ODE model.

Overall, while the algebraic model's predictions align relatively well with the ODE model, it generally overestimates the performance metrics.

Explain the impact of inlet water temperature on the heat rejection and outlet water temperature in the SWME module based on the presented models.

%

Based on the provided image, the impact of inlet water temperature is as follows:
- **Heat Rejection (Plot a)**: As the inlet water temperature increases from about 5째C to 35째C, both models predict higher heat rejection. The algebraic model shows a slight overestimation compared to the ODE model.
- **Outlet Water Temperature (Plot b)**: With rising inlet water temperature, the outlet water temperature also increases according to both models. The algebraic model consistently overpredicts this temperature compared to the ODE model.

These observations suggest that inlet water temperature significantly influences the thermal performance of the SWME module, with the algebraic model tending to overestimate the outcomes.
