The algebraic solution assumes vapor pressure can be evaluated at the average temperature along SWME fiber, $\left(T_{\text{in}} + T_{\text{out}}\right) / 2$. It is expected to have greater error at higher inlet temperatures and specific membrane structure parameters but serves as a quick predictive tool without the computational rigor required by the more accurate ODE model.

## What are the parameters shown in Fig. 6 (a-d) and their relevance to the SWME module's performance?

Fig. 6 displays several parameters: 
- (a) Heat rejection
- (b) Total mass of water vaporized
- (c) Outlet liquid water temperature
- (d) Lumen side pressure drop

These parameters are analyzed as functions of inlet water temperature for different overall membrane structure parameters $S_p$, with $P_{\text{shell}} = 7$ torr and $\dot{m}_{\text{in}} = 91 \text{ kg/h}$. These plots help in understanding the SWME module's performance under varying conditions, crucial for applications such as space thermal management.
