Figure 10 presents the following components regarding LEP in a SWME system:
1. A 3D surface plot showing the relationship between LEP, contact angle, and average pore diameter for different water surface tensions ($\gamma_L$ ranging from 40 to 70 mN/m).
2. Contour plots for fixed water surface tensions of:
   - $\gamma_L = 70 \mathrm{mN} / \mathrm{m}$
   - $\gamma_L = 60 \mathrm{mN} / \mathrm{m}$
   - $\gamma_L = 50 \mathrm{mN} / \mathrm{m}$
   - $\gamma_L = 40 \mathrm{mN} / \mathrm{m}$
These contour plots show different LEP lines as functions of the contact angle and average pore diameter under each specific water surface tension.

## How does the liquid entry pressure (LEP) change with varying contact angles and average pore diameters according to the 3D surface plot in Fig. 10?

In the 3D surface plot of Fig. 10:
- LEP increases with a decrease in the average pore diameter.
- LEP increases with an increase in the contact angle.
- The 3D plot visualizes these changes across different water surface tensions ranging from $\gamma_L = 40$ to $70 \mathrm{mN} / \mathrm{m}$.
- The color bar represents numerical LEP values, indicating pressure thresholds required to overcome capillary forces in membrane pores.
