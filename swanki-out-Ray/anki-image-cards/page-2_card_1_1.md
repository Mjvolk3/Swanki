Figure 1(a) includes a diagram of an astronaut wearing a spacesuit integrated with the SWME (Sweat Management Equipment) module. The diagram details various components of the SWME module, such as the "BPV motor," "BPV Assembly," "Fiber Cartridge with Stainless Steel Frame," "Housing," "Inlet Header," "Outlet Header," and "Internal Volume Access Ports." The pathways for "Inlet water (warm)" and "Outlet water (cold)" are shown, as well as the direction of "Vapor flow."

Figure 1(b) presents a simplified conceptual diagram of a single fiber within the NASA SWME module. The diagram indicates the direction of the atmospheric pressure ($P_{\text{atm}}$) and the placement of a pressure control valve, elucidating the operational principles of this critical component in the SWME system.
