How does the heat rejection in a Seawater Membrane Evaporator (SWME) system change when the pore size is reduced by half compared to the regular pore size?

%

When the pore size is reduced by half, the heat rejection in the SWME system decreases significantly compared to the regular pore size. This effect is due to the increased resistance to vapor flow through the smaller pores, which limits the system's ability to reject heat efficiently. The ratio of heat rejection for the halved pore size versus the regular pore size demonstrates this decline quantitatively. The conditions for the system are given by $\mathrm{P}_{\text {shell }}=7$ torr and $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{P}}=1.04 \times 10^{-4}$.

## Liquid Entry Pressure (LEP) variation with pore diameter and contact angle in SWME membranes

Explain how the contact angle and average pore diameter affect the Liquid Entry Pressure (LEP) for a membrane at various water surface tensions.

%

The LEP is influenced both by the contact angle and the average pore diameter of the membrane. As these parameters vary, the LEP changes, which is crucial for understanding the capillary forces in the membrane:

- In the 3D surface plot (Fig. 10a), higher contact angles and smaller pore diameters generally result in increased LEP, indicative of greater difficulty for liquid to penetrate the membrane.
- The contour plots (Figs. 10b-e) at different water surface tensions ($\gamma_{L}=70 \mathrm{mN}/\mathrm{m}$, $60 \mathrm{mN}/\mathrm{m}$, $50 \mathrm{mN}/\mathrm{m}$, and $40 \mathrm{mN}/\mathrm{m}$) provide a detailed view. Higher surface tension corresponds to higher LEP values, and the effect of varying average pore diameter and contact angle is more pronounced at higher tensions.
