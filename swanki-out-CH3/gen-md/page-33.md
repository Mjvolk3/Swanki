## What is the vector function $\mathbf{u}(x)$ described in the given equations, and how is it defined?
$\mathbf{u}(x) = \binom{x}{x^{2}}$
This vector function $\mathbf{u}(x)$, initially outlined in the exponential family formulas, transforms a scalar $x$ into a vector consisting of $x$ and its square, $x^2$. This function forms part of the transformations applied in exponential family distributions to incorporate natural parameters and sufficient statistics.

## In the context of the given mathematical model, how is the function $g(\boldsymbol{\eta})$ expressed, and what is its role?
$$g(\boldsymbol{\eta}) = \left(-2 \eta_{2}\right)^{1 / 2} \exp \left(\frac{\eta_{1}^{2}}{4 \eta_{2}}\right)$$
The function $g(\boldsymbol{\eta})$ plays a crucial role in the parameterization of the exponential family of distributions, particularly in forming the moment-generating functionality of the distributions involved. Here, $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$ are components of the natural parameter vector $\boldsymbol{\eta}$, influencing the shape and scale respectively of the distribution.

## How is $h(\mathbf{x})$ defined and used in the context of exponential family distributions?
$h(\mathbf{x}) =(2 \pi)^{-1 / 2}$
The function $h(\mathbf{x})$, essentially a normalizing constant here, is a component in the density function of exponential family distributions. Its main role is to ensure that the density function integrates to one, fulfilling the requirements of a probability density function.

## Derive how $-\nabla \ln g(\boldsymbol{\eta})$ equals $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})]$ in the context of exponential family distributions.
Given the equilibrium condition from the maximum likelihood estimation in exponential families:
$$
-\frac{1}{g(\boldsymbol{\eta})} \nabla g(\boldsymbol{\eta})=g(\boldsymbol{\eta}) \int h(\mathbf{x}) \exp \left\{\boldsymbol{\eta}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})\right\} \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}=\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})]
$$
After simplifying the $g(\boldsymbol{\eta})$ terms and using properties of logarithmic differentiation, the left-hand side simplifies to $-\nabla \ln g(\boldsymbol{\eta})$, establishing that it is equal to the expected value of the sufficient statistic $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})$.
This derivation is fundamental in understanding how parameters are estimated within this class of distributions, emphasizing the role of sufficient statistics in parameter estimation.

## Explain the significance of the relationship between $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_k$ and $s$ in the class-conditional densities of the exponential family format.
In the framework where $$p\left(\mathbf{x} \mid \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}, s\right)=\frac{1}{s} h\left(\frac{1}{s} \mathbf{x}\right) g\left(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}\right) \exp \left\{\frac{1}{s} \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{k}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}\right\}$$, $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_k$ represents the parameter vector for each class, allowing differentiation between classes in a classification task. The scale parameter $s$ is shared across all classes, affecting the spread or scale of the distribution but not the class-specific characteristics which are dictated by $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_k$. This sharing of $s$ implies an assumption of common variance or scale among the classes, while allowing the mean (or location) to vary with $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_k$.
This type of structuring can simplify the model while still providing flexibility to capture class-specific features.
