In the $K$-nearest neighbor classifier depicted, the new data point, represented by the black diamond, is classified based on the majority class membership of the $K=3$ nearest training data points surrounding it. Here, $K$ is set to 3, indicating that the classification of the black diamond is influenced by the 3 closest neighbors in the feature space.

## What mathematical formula represents the posterior probability of class membership in $K$-nearest neighbor classification?

The posterior probability of class membership in the $K$-nearest neighbor classification can be calculated using the formula:

$$
p\left(\mathcal{C}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}\right)=\frac{K_{k}}{K}
$$

where $K_k$ is the number of nearest neighbors belonging to class $\mathcal{C}_k$ among the $K$ total nearest neighbors to the point $\mathbf{x}$. This ratio determines the likelihood of assigning the test point $\mathbf{x}$ to the class $\mathcal{C}_k$.
