The elliptical contours in the image represent levels of constant probability density for a 2D Gaussian distribution. The orientation and shape of the ellipses are determined by the covariance structure of the distribution, indicating the degree and direction of correlation between \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \).

## How does the general form of the covariance matrix affect the contours of a 2D Gaussian distribution as depicted in the image?

In the image, the Gaussian distribution's covariance matrix is of a general form, causing the elliptical contours to be oriented in such a way that they are not aligned with the coordinate axes. This illustrates that the variables \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are correlated. The major and minor axes of the ellipses indicate the principal directions of the variation in the data.
