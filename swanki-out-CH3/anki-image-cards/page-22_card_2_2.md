## How does the process of updating the mean estimate $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N)}$ change with each additional data point $\mathbf{x}_N$ according to the given equation?

The mean estimate $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N)}$ is updated by incorporating the new data point $\mathbf{x}_N$ as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N)} = \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N-1)} + \frac{1}{N}(\mathbf{x}_N - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N-1)})
$$

This equation shows that the new estimate is adjusted by a fraction $\frac{1}{N}$ of the error between the new data point $\mathbf{x}_N$ and the previous mean estimate $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N-1)}$. As $N$ increases, the influence of each subsequent data point on the mean estimate decreases.

## Based on the contour plots in part (b) of the image, how does the mixture of two Gaussian distributions improve modeling over a single Gaussian distribution?

The improvement provided by using a mixture of two Gaussian distributions over a single Gaussian is evident through the ability of the mixture model to encapsulate the two distinct clusters observed in the data. Each Gaussian component in the mixture assigns a set of contours that closely align with one of the clusters, thus reflecting the actual data distribution more accurately than a single Gaussian, which places a high probability density in regions where data points are sparse.

The formulation and optimization of such a model typically involve estimating the means, variances, and mixing coefficients ($\pi_k$) of the Gaussian components so that the combined distribution maximizes the likelihood of the observed data, captured effectively by the contours shown in the plot.
