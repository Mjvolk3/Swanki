The parameter $h$ in the kernel density model acts as a smoothing parameter. When $h$ is set too small, it results in a very noisy density model, capturing excessive data noise as seen in the top panel of the figure. Conversely, when $h$ is set too large, it overly smooths the density estimate, washing out significant structures like bimodality, observable in the bottom panel. An optimal $h$, depicted in the middle panel, balances these effects, providing a density estimate that reasonably represents the true underlying distribution without excessive noise or loss of detail.

The kernel density model with Gaussian kernels is given by:
$$
p(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{\left(2 \pi h^{2}\right)^{D / 2}} \exp \left\{-\frac{\left\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{n}\right\|^2}{2 h^{2}}\right\}
$$
This model places a Gaussian function with a mean of $\mathbf{x}_n$ (the data point) and a variance of $h^2$ at each data point. Here, $D$ denotes the dimensionality of the data points and $h$ the standard deviation of the Gaussian components. The exponential term represents the distance of the data point $\mathbf{x}$ from the mean, scaled by the variance. The factor $(2\pi h^2)^{-D/2}$ normalizes the Gaussian distribution. Summing these contributions results in an estimate of the overall density, and dividing by $N$ ensures the result is normalized across the data set.
