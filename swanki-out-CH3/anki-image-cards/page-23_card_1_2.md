The red curve represents the overall Gaussian mixture distribution, which is the sum of the three individual Gaussian distributions depicted in blue. This composite red curve illustrates the combined effect of the three components, yielding a complex probability density function that encapsulates contributions from each Gaussian component.

## How are the components of a Gaussian mixture model related to the overall mixture distribution shown in the image?

In the context of the image, each blue curve represents an individual Gaussian distribution with its own mean and variance. The overall mixture distribution, shown in red, is the weighted sum of these Gaussian components. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

$$
p(t|x) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \pi_i \mathcal{N}(t|\mu_i, \sigma_i^2)
$$

where \( \mathcal{N}(t|\mu_i, \sigma_i^2) \) is the $i$-th Gaussian distribution and \( \pi_i \) are the mixture weights (assumed to sum to one). This yields a probability density function that effectively models a more complex stochastic process by embedding several simpler distributions within its formulation.
