The mixing coefficients for the three Gaussian components are $\pi_1 = 0.5$, $\pi_2 = 0.3$, and $\pi_3 = 0.2$. In the context of a Gaussian mixture model, these coefficients represent the probabilities associated with each Gaussian component, indicating the proportion of the overall mixture that each component contributes to.

## What is the significance of the colors red, blue, and green in the contours of constant density for each of the mixture components shown in the image?

The colors red, blue, and green in the contours of constant density distinguish between the three Gaussian components in the mixture. Each color represents a different Gaussian distribution with its own set of parameters (mean and covariance). This differentiation makes it visually easier to identify and analyze the individual behaviors and characteristics of each component in the mixture.
