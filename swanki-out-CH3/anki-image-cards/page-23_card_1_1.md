The red curve in the image represents the overall Gaussian mixture distribution, which is the sum of the three individual Gaussian distributions (shown in blue). Each blue curve represents a single Gaussian distribution, and their sum results in the complex red curve which captures the total probability density function across the variable 't'.

The Gaussian mixture model illustrated in this image is significant as it showcases how multiple simple Gaussian distributions can be combined to model a more complex probability distribution over a variable 't'. This model allows for capturing variations in data that may not be well-represented by a single Gaussian distribution, making it extremely versatile for modeling diverse probabilistic scenarios. This flexibility is critical in fields like machine learning, where data often exhibits multimodal characteristics.
