The surface plot shown in Figure 3.8(c) represents the probability density function $p(\mathbf{x})$ of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in a two-dimensional space, formed by combining three distinct Gaussian distributions. The plot illustrates the spatial interaction of these components, with peaks indicating the areas of highest probability density corresponding to the centers (means) of each Gaussian component. This visualization is essential in understanding how the mixtures of different Gaussian distributions contribute to the overall probability landscape of the model.

## Question: Considering the Gaussian Mixture Model shown in Figure 3.8(c), describe how the peaks of the surface plot correlate with the components of the model.

Each peak in the surface plot from Figure 3.8(c) directly correlates with the center (mean) of a Gaussian component in the mixture model. The height and sharpness of each peak reflect the concentration (variance) and strength (mixing coefficient) of that specific Gaussian component within the overall distribution. The superposition of these peaks illustrates how each component contributes variably to the mixture, depending essentially on its parameters and the mixing coefficient, forming the complete mixed probability distribution represented in this plot.
