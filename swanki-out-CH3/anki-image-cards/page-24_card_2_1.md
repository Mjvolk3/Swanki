What does Figure 3.8 (a) specifically illustrate in the context of Gaussian mixtures?

%

Figure 3.8 (a) depicts the contours of constant density for each component in a mixture of three Gaussians. Each Gaussian component is represented by a different color (red, blue, and green), and it visually articulates how each contributes separately to the overall mixture within a two-dimensional space. The diagram helps in understanding the spatial influence and coverage of individual Gaussian distributions within the mixture model.

## Analyze the Gaussian mixture distribution

In the description of Gaussian mixtures shown in Figure 3.8, what roles do the mixing coefficients play in the modeling?

%

In Gaussian mixture models, mixing coefficients define the proportions of how much each Gaussian component contributes to the overall mixture distribution. These coefficients, which sum up to one, quantitatively express the relative influence or weight of each component in the model. This is crucial for understanding the significance of each Gaussian in forming the compound probability density function $p(\mathbf{x})$ across the space shown in the figures.
