The Bessel function \(I_0(m)\) viewed in the left graph of the image grows steeply as \(m\) increases, indicating a strong exponential rise with increasing \(m\). This function is crucial in problems involving radial symmetry, where \(m\) often represents a radial distance or a similar parameter.

## Analyze the behavior of function \(A(m)\) based on its graph in the image.

The function \(A(m)\) plotted in the right graph starts at 0 when \(m = 0\) and asymptotically approaches 1 as \(m\) increases, suggesting saturation. This behavior implies that as \(m\) grows larger, further increments in \(m\) yield diminishing increases in \(A(m)\), a phenomenon typical of functions with asymptotic limits. \(A(m)\) is defined as \( \frac{I_1(m)}{I_0(m)} \).
