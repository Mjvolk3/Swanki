## Identify the shape of the probability density contours in a Gaussian distribution when the covariance matrix is diagonal. Refer to the context shown in the image.

The probability density contours are elliptical and aligned with the coordinate axes \(x_1\) and \(x_2\). This configuration means the covariance between \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) is zero, simplifying the interpretation and calculation of probabilities within this two-dimensional Gaussian distribution.

## Describe the implications of a Gaussian distribution having a covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix. You can refer to the image for visualization.

When the covariance matrix of a Gaussian distribution is proportional to the identity matrix, the ellipses of constant probability density are concentric circles, indicating that the variables \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) have equal variance and are uncorrelated. This simplicity allows for easier computations but restricts the distribution's capability to model correlations between the variables effectively.
