Figure 3.4(c) illustrates an isotropic covariance matrix. This is evidenced by the contours of constant probability density forming concentric circles, indicative of equal variance in all directions from the mean, which aligns with the characteristics of an isotropic covariance structure.

## In the context of Gaussian distributions, what do concentric circular contours signify about the properties of the covariance matrix?

Concentric circular contours in a Gaussian distribution signify that the covariance matrix is isotropic. This means that the variance is the same along any direction in the vector space, as opposed to anisotropic where variances differ among directions. This homogeneity enables the distribution to maintain symmetrical properties around the mean.
