What does this histogram plot illustrate about the distribution of the mean of $N$ uniformly distributed numbers as $N$ equals 10?

%

This histogram demonstrates the distribution of the mean of uniformly distributed numbers where $N=10$. The plot shows that as $N$ increases, the distribution of these means tends towards a Gaussian distribution, as per the central limit theorem. The x-axis indicates the mean value, ranging from 0 to 1, and the y-axis represents frequency. Although perfect Gaussian character is not achieved at $N = 10$, it suggests the beginning of the trend towards normalization.

## Entropy and Gaussian Distribution

According to Appendix A, what distribution maximizes the entropy?

%

Appendix A states that, for a single real variable and by extension to the multivariate case, the Gaussian (or normal) distribution is the one that maximizes the entropy among all distributions. This principle underpins why, in diverse settings, Gaussian distributions frequently arise naturally due to their property of maximizing entropy.
