Setting \( h \) too small leads to overfitting of the data, as evidenced by the very noisy blue line in the density estimate that captures too much local variation and fails to reflect a smooth underlying distribution. This manifests in significant oscillations and deviation from the true distribution shown by the smooth green curve.

## How is the kernel density model formulated for the data set as per the given equation?

The kernel density model is defined as:

$$
p(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{\left(2 \pi h^{2}\right)^{D / 2}} \exp \left\{-\frac{\left\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{n}\right\|^2}{2 h^{2}}\right\}
$$

where \( N \) is the number of data points, \( h \) is the standard deviation of the Gaussian components, \( D \) is the dimension of the data space, and \( \mathbf{x}_n \) represents each individual data point. Each point contributes a Gaussian component centered on \( \mathbf{x}_n \) and the contributions are normalized by \( N \) to ensure the resulting density sums to one.
