This surface plot represents the probability density function $p(\mathbf{x})$ of a mixture distribution containing three Gaussian components in a two-dimensional space, typically visualized with variables $x_1$ and $x_2$. The peaks in the plot indicate regions of higher probability density corresponding to each Gaussian component.

The peaks in this three-dimensional surface plot exhibit the characteristics of maximum values of the probability density function for each Gaussian component in the mixture. Each peak corresponds to the mean of a Gaussian, highlighting areas where the combined effect of mixture components results in higher overall probability densities.
