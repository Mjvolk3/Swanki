## According to Figure 3.2, what is observed about the distribution as \( N \) increases in the histograms of the mean of \( N \) uniformly distributed numbers?

As \( N \) increases, the distribution of the mean of uniformly distributed numbers tends towards a Gaussian distribution. This illustrates the Central Limit Theorem, where the mean of a larger number of uniformly distributed variables approaches a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

## What does the Central Limit Theorem indicate about the mean of a large number of uniformly distributed variables, as illustrated by the histograms for \( N = 1 \) and \( N = 2 \)?

The Central Limit Theorem indicates that the mean of a large number of uniformly distributed variables will tend towards a normal (Gaussian) distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables. This is demonstrated in the histograms, where the histogram for \( N = 1 \) shows a uniform distribution, and the histogram for \( N = 2 \) begins to show a more Gaussian-like, bell-shaped distribution.
