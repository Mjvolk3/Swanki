## Why does the single Gaussian model fail to represent the data effectively in figure (a)?

The single Gaussian model, as seen in figure (a), fails to capture the two distinct clumps of data points and instead places a significant amount of probability density in the central area where data is sparse. This misrepresentation occurs because a single Gaussian assumes a unimodal distribution, which is inadequate for modeling the clearly bimodal nature of the observed data.

## Can you explain the update formula for the mean of a Gaussian distribution when a new data point is added?

$$
\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N)} = \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N-1)} + \frac{1}{N}(\mathbf{x}_{N} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N-1)})
$$

%

This formula represents an incremental update of the estimated mean $$\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}$$ as new data points are observed. The updated mean $$\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N)}$$ is calculated by shifting the previous mean $$ \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathrm{ML}}^{(N-1)} $$ in the direction of the new data point $$ \mathbf{x}_{N} $$, adjusted by a factor of $$ \frac{1}{N} $$ which represents the influence of the new observation. This process allows the mean to be updated continually as more data becomes available, without needing to recompute the mean from scratch.
