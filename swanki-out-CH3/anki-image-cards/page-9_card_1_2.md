The red curve in the image represents an elliptical surface of constant probability density for a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution, on which the density is $\exp (-1 / 2)$ of its maximum value at $\mathbf{x} = \mu$. This ellipse is defined by the eigenvectors $\mathbf{u}_{i}$ of the covariance matrix, with the axes corresponding to the eigenvalues $\lambda_{i}$.

## How does the transformation from the $\mathbf{x}$ to $\mathbf{y}$ coordinate system occur in the Gaussian distribution analysis described?

The transformation from the $\mathbf{x}$ to the $\mathbf{y}$ coordinate system, when analyzing a Gaussian distribution, involves changing the basis to align with the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. This transition requires the use of a Jacobian matrix $\mathbf{J}$, defined by:

$$
J_{ij} = \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial y_j} = U_{ji}
$$

where $U_{ji}$ are the elements of the matrix $\mathbf{U}^\mathrm{T}$ (transpose of the matrix of eigenvectors). This transformation simplifies the representation of the covariance matrix, which in the new coordinates will be diagonal, with eigenvalues as diagonal entries.
