The contours depicted in Figure 3.5 (a) represent a bivariate Gaussian distribution over two variables, \(x_a\) and \(x_b\). These contour lines indicate regions of constant probability density, with the highest density at the center and progressively decreasing as the lines spread outwards.

## In Figure 3.5, how is the red line at \(x_b=0.7\) related to the statistical distributions shown?

The red line at \(x_b = 0.7\) in Figure 3.5 (a) marks a specific value of \(x_b\) used to evaluate the conditional distribution \( p(x_a \mid x_b) \). This line intersects the contours of the bivariate Gaussian distribution, indicating the location in the probability space for which the conditional distribution \( p(x_a \mid x_b=0.7) \) will be calculated. This distribution is also depicted in Figure 3.5 (b) as the red curve alongside the marginal distribution \( p(x_a) \).
