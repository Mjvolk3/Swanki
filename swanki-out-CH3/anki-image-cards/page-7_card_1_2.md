The histogram labeled "N = 1" indicates a uniform distribution of the data values across the range from 0 to 1. Each bin is equally tall, suggesting that each interval within the range has an equal frequency of occurrence. This is typical for data coming directly from a uniform distribution.

## Explain how the histogram labeled "N = 2" in the provided image demonstrates the initial stages of convergence towards a Gaussian distribution.

The histogram labeled "N = 2" shows a distribution that is beginning to form a bell-shaped or Gaussian curve, particularly evident through the higher frequencies observed around the center of the range (0.5) and lower frequencies towards the ends (0 and 1). This visual transition from a uniform to a bell-shaped distribution illustrates the Central Limit Theorem's impact, implying that the mean of even two uniformly distributed variables begins to approximate a Gaussian distribution as $N$ increases.
