Figure 3.5(a) illustrates the contours of a bivariate Gaussian distribution over two variables, \( x_a \) and \( x_b \). Each contour line represents points of equal probability density. The contours are more closely packed in areas where the probability density is higher, indicating the distribution is centered around these areas. The red line shows \( x_b = 0.7 \), marking it for the conditional distribution \( p(x_a \mid x_b=0.7) \).

## How do the red and blue curves in Figure 3.5(b) relate to each other and what do they each represent?

In Figure 3.5(b), the blue curve represents the marginal distribution \( p(x_a) \), indicating the overall distribution of \( x_a \) irrespective of \( x_b \). In contrast, the red curve represents the conditional distribution \( p(x_a \mid x_b=0.7) \), showing the distribution of \( x_a \) when \( x_b \) is fixed at 0.7. These curves illustrate the impact of conditioning on a specific value of one variable within a joint distribution â€” the conditional distribution's peak is shifted and its spread may vary compared to the marginal, highlighting how the knowledge of \( x_b \) modifies the distribution of \( x_a \).
