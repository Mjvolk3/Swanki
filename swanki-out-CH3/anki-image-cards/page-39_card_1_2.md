## How does the parameter $K$ in K-nearest neighbour density estimation affect the smoothness of the estimated density model?

In K-nearest neighbour density estimation, the parameter $K$ governs the degree of smoothing of the estimated density model. A smaller value of $K$, like $K=1$, results in a very noisy density model, where the estimation is highly sensitive to individual data points, as seen in the top panel. On the other hand, a larger value of $K$, such as $K=30$, results in a smoother model that may obscure finer details of the data's distribution, evidenced by the close approximation of the smooth green curve in the bottom panel.

## Examine the output influence of changing $K$ from $1$ to $30$ on the representation of the underlying true distribution in K-nearest neighbour density estimation.

Changing the parameter $K$ from $1$ to $30$ in K-nearest neighbour density estimation significantly influences the representation of the data's underlying true distribution. At $K=1$, the estimation is highly erratic and noisy, reflecting over-fitting where the model captures too much of the data's random fluctuations (top panel). As $K$ increases, such as at $K=5$ and $K=30$, the model becomes less sensitive to individual outliers and more robust in approximating the true distribution, as observed by the improved alignment with the smooth green curve. At $K=30$, the noise is substantially reduced, but the model may oversmooth, potentially losing important details in the underlying bimodal distribution.
