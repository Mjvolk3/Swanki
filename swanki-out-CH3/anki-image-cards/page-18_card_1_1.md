Figure 3.5 (a) shows contours of a bivariate Gaussian distribution $p(x_a, x_b)$, where each contour line represents an equi-probability density. The distribution is centered where contours are densest, indicating the mean of the distribution. The shape and orientation of the contours suggest the covariance structure between $x_a$ and $x_b$: elongation along a diagonal indicates correlation, while circular contours would imply independence.

## Describe the relationship between the marginal and conditional distributions in Figure 3.5 (b).

Figure 3.5 (b) compares the marginal distribution $p(x_a)$ (blue curve) to the conditional distribution $p(x_a \mid x_b = 0.7)$ (red curve). The marginal distribution represents the overall distribution of $x_a$ without considering $x_b$. The conditional distribution, in contrast, is the distribution of $x_a$ given that $x_b$ is fixed at $0.7$. The shift in the peak of the red curve relative to the blue indicates the effect $x_b$ has on $x_a$; such shifts and differences in spread indicate how $x_b$ constrains or impacts the possible values and variability of $x_a$.
