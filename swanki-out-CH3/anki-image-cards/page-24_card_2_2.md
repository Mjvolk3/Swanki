This is an example of contours of constant density for the different components within a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Each color (red, blue, green) represents a distinct Gaussian component with its eigenvalues of covariance and mean marked typically by an 'X' or the densest central location. These contour plots aid in visualizing the distribution and overlap among the different components, demonstrating the underlying probabilistic framework where these components contribute in varying proportions (defined by their respective mixing coefficients) to the overall mixture.

## Explain how the marginal probability density is visualized and its importance in understanding mixtures

The second subfigure (b) of Figure 3.8 illustrates the marginal probability density \( p(\mathbf{x}) \) of a Gaussian mixture distribution through contour lines. This visualization is critical as it aggregates the contributions of all mixture components across the entire support of the distribution. Contour plots provide a straightforward means to see the modes and areas of highest data concentration, where the lines are closest. Understanding this can significantly aid in applications like clustering, where such distributions are used to model the underlying structure in multivariate data.
