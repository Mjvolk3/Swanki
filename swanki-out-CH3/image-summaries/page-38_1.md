ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a graph representing a kernel density estimate of a data set, with a very small smoothing parameter \( h = 0.005 \). The horizontal axis likely represents some variable across its domain, possibly the data points in the set, while the vertical axis represents the estimated density values for that variable.

The graph displays a noisy blue line that oscillates significantly, indicating the density estimate at various points across the variable's domain. The small value of \( h \) has led to a high sensitivity to local variations in the data, and as a result, the density estimate appears to be overfitting the data, capturing too much noise and not reflecting a smooth underlying distribution.

Also shown on the chart is a smooth green curve, which likely represents the true or underlying distribution from which the data points were sampled. The discrepancy between the green curve and the noisy blue line illustrates the paper's point: when \( h \) is set very small, the resulting density model can be very noisy and does not smoothly capture the true properties of the underlying distribution.

The context provided suggests that the figure should serve as a visual example of what happens when the smoothing parameter \( h \) in kernel density estimation is set too small, leading to a result that is not ideal for representing the true density of the data.
