ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows three histograms, each representing density estimates of a data set consisting of 50 data points that were generated from a distribution depicted by the background green curve (which appears to be a mixture of two Gaussians). The histograms are illustrating different levels of granularity based on varying bin widths, Delta (Δ), for the density estimation.

The top histogram uses a bin width of Δ = 0.04, resulting in a very spiked representation that exhibits more variance and captures very fine details of the data, potentially including noise or fluctuations that are not representative of the underlying distribution.

The middle histogram employs a bin width of Δ = 0.08. This histogram is smoother than the one above, capturing a more balanced representation of the underlying distribution while providing some detail of its structure.

The bottom histogram utilizes a bin width of Δ = 0.25, which oversimplifies the underlying distribution, smoothing out important details such as the bimodal peaks, and not effectively representing the true distribution.

Each histogram demonstrates the effect of choosing different bin widths on the estimated probability density function, highlighting the necessity of selecting an optimal bin width to accurately model the true underlying distribution without introducing too much noise or oversmoothing the features.
