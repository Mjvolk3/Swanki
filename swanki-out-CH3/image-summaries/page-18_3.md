ChatGPT figure/image summary: Based on the provided context, the image shows two probability density functions (PDFs) plotted as curves. The blue curve represents the marginal distribution of a random variable \( x_a \), denoted as \( p(x_a) \). The red curve represents the conditional probability distribution \( p(x_a | x_b = 0.7) \), which means it is the distribution of random variable \( x_a \) given that another random variable \( x_b \) has a value of 0.7.

The curves are plotted against the values of \( x_a \) on the horizontal axis, while the vertical axis shows the probability densities. The area under each curve would integrate to 1 since these are probability distributions. The blue curve, representing the marginal distribution, appears to be broader and flatter, suggesting a larger variance compared to the red curve. The red curve, representing the conditional distribution, is narrower and has a peak that suggests a higher probability density for certain values of \( x_a \), indicating a smaller variance and more certainty about \( x_a \) when \( x_b \) is known to be 0.7. The specific mathematical forms of these distributions would depend on the parameters of the Gaussian distributions they are derived from, as detailed in the surrounding text.
