ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image illustrates a unit circle with a few points represented on its circumference, symbolizing values of a periodic variable as two-dimensional vectors. These vectors are marked as \( x_1, x_2, x_3, \) and \( x_4 \) and are positioned at various angles around the circle. The average of these vectors is represented by a vector \( \bar{x} \) inside the circle, pointing towards the circumference but not reaching it, indicating that the average vector \( \bar{x} \) generally lies within the unit circle. This depiction aligns with the text, which describes a process for calculating the mean of observations of a periodic variable that avoids the problems associated with coordinate dependence, which arise when using standard linear averages for circular data. This is important when dealing with angles or time of day to ensure that the measure of central tendency is meaningful and consistent irrespective of where the angular origin is placed.
