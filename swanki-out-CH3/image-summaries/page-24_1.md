ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a two-dimensional plane with contour plots representing three different Gaussian distributions, overlaid on top of each other. Each set of concentric rings represents the contours of constant density for one Gaussian component. The contours are colored differently for each Gaussian component: one in red, another in blue, and the third in green. The mixing coefficients, which are the probabilities associated with each Gaussian component, are indicated on the image with the symbols "π1 = 0.5", "π2 = 0.3", and "π3 = 0.2" next to the corresponding contour plots. The location of the highest density for each Gaussian is marked with a small circle (•) at the center of the concentric rings, where the contours are closest together. This visualization helps to illustrate the concept of a Gaussian mixture model where multiple Gaussian probability distributions are combined to form a more complex distribution.
