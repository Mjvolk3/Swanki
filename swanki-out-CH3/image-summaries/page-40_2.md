ChatGPT figure/image summary: The provided image graphs the decision boundary of a classification problem in a two-dimensional feature space labeled \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). Red and blue dots represent data points from two different classes in the feature space. A green line represents the decision boundary determined by a nearest-neighbour classification algorithm (likely for \( K=1 \), as the boundary is nonlinear and appears to be adapting closely to the individual data points).

This decision boundary is used to classify new data points based on their proximity to existing points from the training dataset. If a new point falls on one side of the green line, it would be classified into one class (say, the blue class), and if it falls on the other side, it would be classified into the red class. The decision boundary visually represents how the nearest-neighbour algorithm distinguishes between the two classes based on the closest training examples.
