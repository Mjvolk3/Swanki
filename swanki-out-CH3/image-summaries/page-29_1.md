ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image displays two graphs side by side. On the left graph, a red curve represents the Bessel function \( I_0(m) \) plotted against \( m \) on the horizontal axis and \( I_0(m) \) on the vertical axis. The curve starts near the origin and rises steeply as \( m \) increases, indicating that \( I_0(m) \) grows rapidly with \( m \).

On the right graph, a red curve depicts the function \( A(m) \), which is plotted against \( m \) on the horizontal axis and \( A(m) \) on the vertical axis. The graph shows that \( A(m) \) starts at 0 when \( m \) is 0 and asymptotically approaches 1 as \( m \) increases, suggesting that \( A(m) \) saturates to a value of 1 for large \( m \).

Both graphs share a similar range for \( m \) on their respective horizontal axes, starting at 0 and extending to 10. Vertical axis scales are different due to the different nature of the functions plotted. The left graph's vertical axis reaches beyond 3000 to accommodate the rapid growth of the Bessel function, while the right graph's vertical axis goes up to 1 to display the saturation behavior of \( A(m) \).
