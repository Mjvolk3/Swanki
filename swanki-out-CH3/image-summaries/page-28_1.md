ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image presents two graphs representing the von Mises distribution for two different sets of parameter values. On the left side, there is a Cartesian plot where the horizontal axis likely represents the angle θ (ranging from 0 to 2π or from -π to π, though the axis is not explicitly labeled) and the vertical axis represents the probability density. The plot includes two curves corresponding to two different von Mises distributions:

- A red curve for the distribution with parameters m = 5, θ₀ = π/4.
- A blue curve for the distribution with parameters m = 1, θ₀ = 3π/4.

The red curve is narrower and has a higher peak, indicating a higher concentration parameter m, and suggests more certainty about the mean direction θ₀. Conversely, the blue curve is broader and flatter, indicating a lower concentration and hence more dispersion around the mean direction.

On the right side, there are polar plots corresponding to the same von Mises distributions. The horizontal line in the middle of the polar plot likely represents 0 radians (or 0 degrees), and the plot ranges from 0 to 2π in the clockwise direction. In polar coordinates, the angular variable θ is represented as the angle from the positive horizontal axis, and the radius indicates the probability density for that angle. The red curve (m = 5, θ₀ = π/4) is shown as a sharply defined bump indicating a direction around π/4 where the density is highest. The blue curve (m = 1, θ₀ = 3π/4) is more spread out, matching the same characteristics shown on the Cartesian plot.

These plots serve to visualize how the von Mises distribution, which is a probability distribution on the circle, changes with different values of the parameters m (concentration) and θ₀ (mean direction).
