ChatGPT figure/image summary: The images provided are graphical representations illustrating concepts from the paper related to multivariate Gaussian distributions and their marginal and conditional distributions. Here's a breakdown of what each image depicts:

- Image (a) shows contours of a bivariate (two-dimensional) Gaussian distribution for the variables \( x_a \) and \( x_b \). The contours represent points of equal probability density, and the distribution is centered where the contours are most closely spaced. The red line at \( x_b = 0.7 \) indicates a specific value of \( x_b \) for which the conditional distribution \( p(x_a | x_b = 0.7) \) is derived.

- Image (b) compares two probability distribution curves plotted against \( x_a \). The blue curve represents the marginal distribution \( p(x_a) \), showing the distribution of \( x_a \) without considering \( x_b \). The red curve represents the conditional distribution \( p(x_a | x_b = 0.7) \), which is the distribution of \( x_a \) given that \( x_b \) is fixed at a value of 0.7. The peak of the red curve is shifted relative to the blue curve, and its spread (variance) might be different, reflecting the conditional information imposed by \( x_b \).

The figures essentially visualize the concepts discussed in the paper, showcasing how the joint Gaussian distribution factors into marginal and conditional distributions based on the variables' covariances and means.
