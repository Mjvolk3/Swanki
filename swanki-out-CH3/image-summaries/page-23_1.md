ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image displays a Gaussian mixture distribution in one dimension. There are three individual Gaussian distributions shown in blue, each characterized by their own mean and spread. The red curve represents the overall mixture distribution which is the sum of the blue Gaussian distributions. The horizontal axis, labeled 't', can be interpreted as the variable for which the distribution is defined, while the vertical axis, labeled 'p(t|x)', represents the probability density. Each blue curve depicts one component of the mixture model with its respective peak and width, while the overall red curve reflects the combined effect of the three components, resulting in a more complex probability density function that captures the contribution from each individual component in the mixture.
