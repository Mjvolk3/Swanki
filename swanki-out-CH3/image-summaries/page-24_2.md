ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image shows a two-dimensional space with contours plotted to represent a probability density function, \( p(\mathbf{x}) \). The contours are in a shape that suggests that the density function is composed of multiple modes or peaks, which are likely formed by the mixture of several Gaussian distributions. The highest density areas, representing the higher probability regions, are where the contour lines are closest together. This pattern exemplifies how a Gaussian mixture distribution can lead to complex, multi-modal density patterns in a two-dimensional space.
