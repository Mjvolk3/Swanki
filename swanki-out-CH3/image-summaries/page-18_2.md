ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a two-dimensional plot showing contours of a bivariate Gaussian distribution \( p(x_a, x_b) \) with respect to two variables \( x_a \) and \( x_b \). These contours represent regions of constant probability density. The horizontal axis is labeled \( x_a \) and ranges from 0 to 1, while the vertical axis is labeled \( x_b \) and also ranges from 0 to 1.

There is a red horizontal line on the plot at \( x_b = 0.7 \), indicating a specific value of \( x_b \) where the conditional distribution \( p(x_a | x_b) \) might be evaluated. The concentration of the contour lines towards the center indicates the area of highest probability density, and as one moves outward from the center, the probability density decreases, as suggested by the spacing of the contour lines. The labels on the axes, contour lines, and the red line are clearly laid out to illustrate this statistical concept.
