**Microglia Development and Maturation and Its Implications for Induction of Microglia-Like Cells from Human iPSCs**

Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, playing pivotal roles in brain development, homeostasis, and pathology response. These cells originate from yolk sac erythromyeloid progenitors and migrate into the embryonic brain, where they differentiate and mature postnatally. This maturation is driven by various chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors, with TGF-beta 1 being a significant regulator. TGF-beta 1 mediates microglial homeostasis, anti-inflammatory responses, and the expression of key microglial genes. Given the challenges of isolating homeostatic human microglia, recent advancements have focused on differentiating human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into microglia-like cells. However, the differentiation protocols vary widely in terms of cytokines, growth factors, and culture conditions, leading to discrepancies in the maturity and functionality of the derived cells.

**Introduction to Microglia**

Microglia are a specialized subset of myeloid cells that reside within the central nervous system (CNS). Recent progress in understanding microglia development has led to various in vitro protocols for generating human microglia-like cells (hiMGLs) from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). While these hiMGLs share some molecular signatures with native human microglia, the differentiation protocols need to reflect the latest insights from in vivo microglia maturation studies. Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is highlighted as a crucial factor in this maturation process. Properly matured hiMGLs are essential for functional studies and potential microglia replacement therapies in humans.

**Mouse Microglia Development and Maturation In Vivo**

**Mouse Microglia Origin and Development**

Unlike other macrophage populations, microglia and CNS-associated resident macrophages originate from primitive macrophages during the initial wave of hematopoiesis. These primitive macrophages develop from early erythro-myeloid progenitors in the yolk sac around embryonic day 8.5, requiring transcription factors PU.1 and Irf8 for their development. Differing from monocyte-derived macrophages, these cells do not need the transcription factor Myb. Initially expressing the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit, they gradually lose this marker while gaining CD45 expression. Around embryonic day 9.5, these primitive macrophages migrate towards the neural tube, populating the developing brain and spinal cord and eventually giving rise to microglia. This migration is facilitated by Interleukin 34 (IL-34), signaling through the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (Csf1r). Additional factors like Maf, Mef2c, and Sall1 are also critical for proper microglia development.

**Mouse Postnatal Microglia Maturation**

Following the prenatal colonization and proliferation, postnatal microglia maturation involves a specific gene expression pattern that distinguishes them from other macrophages. Genes like Tmem119, Olfml3, P2yr12, and Sall1 are upregulated in the first two postnatal weeks, driven by TGF-beta signaling. Neuron-derived TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 released by NG2-glia are crucial for this process. The importance of TGF-beta 1 is underscored by studies showing that its absence leads to a lack of microglia maturation and an inflammatory phenotype. These findings suggest that TGF-beta signaling is essential for maintaining microglial homeostasis and regulating their reactivity. While the functional significance of many homeostatic microglia markers remains unclear, their expression is believed to be vital for mediating microglia functions under physiological conditions.

**Functional Consequences of Impaired Microglial Maturation**

Microglia play essential roles in CNS development and maintenance, such as synaptic pruning, neuronal circuit formation, and supporting neuron survival and myelination. Impaired microglial maturation can have severe consequences, such as motor deficits and loss of cortical inhibitory interneurons. These effects underscore the need for fully matured microglia-like cells from hiPSCs for accurate functional analyses and potential replacement therapies.

**Generation of Human Microglia-Like Cells from hiPSCs**

The understanding of microglia development largely comes from rodent studies, with few insights from human embryos. Despite sharing many functions, human and rodent microglia have differences at the regulatory level. For example, TGF-beta-mediated suppression of HLA expression is observed only in mouse models, while certain immune genes are exclusive to human microglia. The isolation of homeostatic human microglia is challenging due to senescence and pathology-associated cues. Immortalized human microglial cell lines and hiPSCs offer solutions, but the differentiation protocols must ensure complete maturation to replicate the full spectrum of in vivo microglia functions.

In summary, understanding the development and maturation of microglia is crucial for generating functional microglia-like cells from hiPSCs. These cells hold potential for future studies and therapies, provided they accurately mimic the properties of native human microglia.
**Factors Influencing Microglia Maturation in Mice**

Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, undergo a complex maturation process influenced by a multitude of factors during prenatal and postnatal stages in mice. These stages are critical for the proper development and functionality of microglia, which play essential roles in brain homeostasis, immune defense, and neuroinflammation.

**Prenatal Factors:**

During the prenatal stage, microglia originate from yolk sac progenitors that migrate into the developing brain. This migration is influenced by various signaling molecules and cellular interactions. Key growth factors and cytokines, such as bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), stem cell factor (SCF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), drive the differentiation of these progenitors into microglia precursors. Oxygen levels also play a crucial role, as lower oxygen conditions, similar to those found in the embryonic environment, promote the survival and differentiation of microglial progenitors.

**Postnatal Factors:**

In the postnatal stage, microglia continue to mature and integrate into the neural tissue. This maturation process is influenced by the local brain environment, including interactions with neurons and astrocytes. Cytokines such as interleukin-34 (IL-34) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) are critical for the survival and maturation of microglia. These factors activate the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), which is essential for microglial development and maintenance. Additionally, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) plays a significant role in regulating microglial homeostasis and function.

**Experimental Protocols for Human Microglia-like Cells**

To study microglial development and function in vitro, researchers have developed protocols for differentiating human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into microglia-like cells (hiMGLs). These protocols aim to mimic the in vivo developmental stages of microglia by exposing hiPSCs to specific growth factors, cytokines, and environmental conditions.

**Differentiation into Microglia Progenitors:**

The differentiation process begins with the induction of mesodermal differentiation using BMP4, a critical molecule in nearly all protocols. Additional factors such as SCF and VEGF support mesodermal specification. Wnt signaling is also involved, with initial activation promoting the generation of hemangioblasts, followed by inhibition to drive the differentiation into primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HPCs). These HPCs are comparable to yolk sac progenitors in human microglia development.

**Generation of Myeloid Progenitors:**

In the next step, myeloid progenitors are generated using a mix of cytokines, including Flt3, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), IL-3, IL-6, SCF, VEGF, and thrombopoietin (TPO). The precise timing and combination of these factors are crucial for the successful differentiation into hiMGLs. Reduced oxygen levels during initial hematopoietic differentiation have also been shown to enhance the generation of myeloid progenitors.

**Final Differentiation and Maturation:**

The final differentiation step involves switching the cytokine cocktail to IL-34 and MCSF for 10 to 30 days. These factors are critical for microglial survival and maturation, leading to the expression of markers associated with immature and mature microglia, such as MERTK, ITGB5, CX3CR1, IBA1, CD11b, and TMEM119. This expression pattern is crucial for mimicking the functionality of primary human microglia.

**Role of TGF-β in Microglia Differentiation:**

TGF-β1 is a key regulator of microglial development, homeostasis, and survival. It acts through the TGF-β receptor 1 (TGFBR1), which is highly expressed by both rodent microglia cultures and hiMGLs. Withdrawal of TGF-β from the culture medium significantly reduces the expression of microglial surface receptors and transcription factors, highlighting its importance in maintaining microglial identity and function. Interestingly, TGF-β's effects can be mimicked by a small molecule called Inducer of Definitive Endoderm1 (IDE1), which mediates similar signaling pathways and promotes cell proliferation and differentiation.

**Cell-Cell and Cell-Matrix Interactions:**

The complex microglial niche in the developing brain involves interactions with neurons and astrocytes, which are crucial for the full maturation of hiMGLs. Co-culture with neurons or exposure to neuron-conditioned medium can shift the transcriptome of hiMGLs towards a fetal microglia-like state and promote homeostatic functions. These interactions lead to a more ramified morphology, enhanced migration abilities, and reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines, indicating mechanisms of neuron-mediated homeostasis.

In conclusion, understanding the factors that influence microglia maturation in mice and developing robust protocols for generating human microglia-like cells in vitro are essential for advancing our knowledge of microglial biology and their roles in neurological diseases. By mimicking the developmental stages and environmental cues of microglia, researchers can create more accurate and functional models for studying microglial function and developing potential therapeutic strategies.
## Conditioned Media

There are intriguing hints that transforming growth factor beta, or TGF beta, signaling could be partly responsible for influencing hiPSCs, or human-induced pluripotent stem cells, particularly in the context of neural tissue development. TGF beta is continuously secreted by both developing and adult neural tissues. However, we still need to delve deeper into the molecular mechanisms of how hiPSCs directly and indirectly interact with neural cells to enhance differentiation and maturation for in vitro applications. This area remains ripe for further exploration.

Regarding factors that impact the differentiation and maturation of induced microglia-like cells, or iMGLs, single studies have pointed to the potential influence of the extracellular matrix. For instance, fibronectin coating has been shown to result in a more complex, branched morphology of iMGLs compared to coatings with poly-D-lysine, collagen I, gelatin, or laminin. This indicates that the extracellular environment can have a significant impact on cell morphology. Furthermore, additional treatments with soluble CD200 and the chemokine CX3CL1 showed only minor changes in microglial signature genes. This suggests that these factors might influence microglial functions more so than their differentiation or maturation.

## Summary and Conclusions

In summary, generating human-induced microglia-like cells, or hiMGLs, from human-induced pluripotent stem cells closely mirrors the well-documented processes of microglia differentiation and maturation observed in mice. Consequently, hiMGLs could serve as a powerful tool for studying the functional aspects of human microglia. However, for such studies to be meaningful, it's crucial that these in vitro generated cells exhibit the same molecular signatures as their in vivo counterparts. To bridge the gap between human in vivo studies, comparative analyses of hiMGLs and mouse-derived iMGLs should be conducted. This will help us understand the common and divergent maturation pathways.

To gain a better grasp of the specific developmental and maturation mechanisms, we need to dissect the molecular interactions of known and unknown modulators that guide the specification of microglial phenotypes at various developmental stages and in different brain regions in mice. Translating these findings into differentiation protocols will pave the way for more reliable and robust in vitro generation of microglia. This ensures that these cells share the typical expression signature and functionality with their in vivo counterparts. Such advances are essential for a deeper understanding of the molecular background of human microglia, including their potential contribution to neurodegenerative diseases. This understanding will be crucial for future microglia replacement strategies.

Recent findings emphasize the importance of TGF beta 1 and microglial TGF beta signaling in hiMGL differentiation protocols. Therefore, further studies need to address the specific effects of TGF beta 1 in human microglia and hiMGLs to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Additionally, the potential benefits of TGF beta 1 as a factor for hiMGL maturation must be analyzed and validated in detail to generate hiMGLs that retain essential features of human microglia in vivo.
