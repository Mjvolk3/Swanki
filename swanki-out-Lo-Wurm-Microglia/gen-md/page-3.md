## Describe the implications of impaired microglial maturation for CNS development and function.

Impaired microglial maturation can detrimentally affect CNS development and function, specifically by disrupting synaptic pruning, neuronal circuit formation, neuron survival support, and oligodendrocyte-mediated postnatal myelination. It might also compromise learning-dependent synapse formation and overall synapse function integrity.
