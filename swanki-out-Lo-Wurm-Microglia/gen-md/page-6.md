### Card 1

#### How is final microglia differentiation primarily induced in vitro?

Final microglia differentiation is primarily induced by switching to a cytokine cocktail of IL-34 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) for at least 10 to 30 days. This is in accordance with in vivo observations that microglia survival is dependent on the activation of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R).

### Card 2

#### What are some major markers associated with immature and mature microglia, and what leads to their expression?

The combination of IL-34 and MCSF leads to the expression of several markers associated with immature and mature microglia, including MERTK, ITGB5, CX3CR1, TGFBR1, IBA1, CD11b, and TMEM119.

### Card 3

#### What concentrations of IL-34 are typically used in protocols for microglial differentiation, and what occurs when this factor is removed?

IL-34 is typically used at high concentrations of $100 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ for microglial differentiation. Removal of IL-34 leads to the depletion of hiMGLs (human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia-like cells).

### Card 4

#### What evidence highlights the problem of species differences in microglial differentiation protocols?

The problem of species differences in microglial differentiation protocols is highlighted by the fact that murine cytokines do not effectively bind to hiMGL receptors. To address this, mice carrying the human transgenes encoding CSF1 have been generated, which has demonstrated successful hiPSC integration into mouse tissue dependent on human CSF1.

### Card 5

#### What set of genes has been reported to be specific for the human microglial signature, and how does their expression in hiMGLs compare to primary adult human microglia?

A set of genes, including MERTK, GPR34, PROS1, C1QA, GAS6, and P2RY12, has been reported to be specific for the human microglial signature. These genes are detected at similar or even higher levels in hiMGLs compared to primary adult human microglia.

### Card 6

#### What role might human astrocytes play in the final microglial differentiation, according to recent observations?

Recent observations suggest that final microglial differentiation could be supported solely by coculture with human astrocytes. This raises the possibility that an astrocytic secretome, comprising various factors including GMCSF, IL-6, IL-8, and TGFÎ², could mediate this differentiation.
