## Describe the importance of TGF $\beta 1$ in the differentiation protocols for hiMGLs.

TGF $\beta 1$ is essential in hiMGL differentiation protocols due to its role in microglial TGF $\beta$ signaling, which has significant effects on human microglia and hiMGLs. Research shows that it is crucial to further address these effects to understand the molecular mechanisms behind TGF $\beta 1$-mediated impacts.

## Mention a factor that needs detailed analysis and validation to generate hiMGLs akin to human microglia in vivo.

The benefit of TGF $\beta 1$ as an additional factor for hiMGL maturation needs to be analyzed and validated in more detail to generate hiMGLs that share essential features of human microglia in vivo.
