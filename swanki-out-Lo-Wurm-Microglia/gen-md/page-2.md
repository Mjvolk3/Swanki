## What signaling pathway is crucial for microglia maturation?

The signaling pathway crucial for microglia maturation is TGF$\beta$ signaling.

## What is the role of TGF$\beta$1 in postnatal microglia maturation?

TGF$\beta$1 is critically involved in triggering postnatal microglia maturation. It is essential for the development and proper maturation of microglia, leading to the upregulation of microglia homeostatic markers.

## What happens when TGF$\beta$1 signaling is impaired in microglia?

When TGF$\beta$1 signaling is impaired in microglia, there is a loss of microglia maturation, a reduction in homeostatic microglia marker expression, and the microglia exhibit an inflammatory phenotype characterized by increased expression of inflammatory markers like $ApoE$, $Axl$, $CybB$, $Cd74$, $H2-Aa$, and $Il1b$.

## Which genes are referred to as microglia homeostatic markers?

Microglia homeostatic markers include genes such as $Tmem119$, $Olfml3$, $P2yr12$, $Sall1$, $Hexb$, $Gpr34$, $Fcrls$, and $SiglecH$, which are upregulated within the first two postnatal weeks in mice.

## Describe the migration pattern of primitive macrophages towards the neural tube and their maturation into microglia.

Primitive macrophages migrate towards the neural tube to populate the developing brain and spinal cord around embryonic day E9.5. This migration is dependent on the secretion of Interleukin 34 (IL-34) by neurons, which activates the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (Csf1r) on developing microglia, eventually leading to the formation of mature microglia.

## How does the interaction with the gut microbiome affect microglia?

Interactions with the gut microbiome are critical for the establishment of region-specific microglia heterogeneity during the first postnatal weeks.
