## What is the role of TGF $\beta 1$ in microglia maturation?

TGF $\beta 1$ plays a critical role in the maturation of microglia, which includes mediating homeostasis, anti-inflammation, and triggering the expression of microglial homeostatic signature genes.

## Which specialized subset of cells do microglia represent in the Central Nervous System (CNS)?

Microglia represent a specialized subset of myeloid cells and serve as the resident immune cell population of the Central Nervous System (CNS).

## How are human microglia-like cells (hiMGLs) typically generated in vitro, and what issue does their incomplete differentiation cause?

Human microglia-like cells (hiMGLs) are generated in vitro from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Incomplete differentiation hampers their similarity to primary human microglia, thereby influencing the outcomes of follow-up studies.

## What major developmental steps do microglia undergo starting from yolk sac erythromyeloid progenitors?

Microglia originate from yolk sac erythromyeloid progenitors, immigrate into the embryonic brain parenchyma, and undergo postnatal differentiation and maturation driven by chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors.

## Why is transformation growth factor $\beta$ (TGF $\beta$) considered an essential maturation factor in creating human microglia-like cells?

Transformation growth factor $\beta$ (TGF $\beta$) is critical because it facilitates the homeostasis, anti-inflammation, and expression of microglial homeostatic signature genes, which are necessary for the maturation of human microglia-like cells.

## Describe the challenge with isolating homeostatic microglia from human tissue, and how hiPSCs provide a solution.

Isolating homeostatic microglia from human tissue is challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining pure and viable cells. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer a solution by allowing the differentiation of microglia-like cells in vitro, thereby providing a more accessible and controlled environment for research.
