## What is the impact of the loss of microglial TGF $\beta$ signaling on motor functions according to the paper?

The loss of microglial TGF $\beta$ signaling results in the development of spastic motor deficits due to impaired postnatal myelination of grey and white matter tracts, caused by disturbed oligodendrocyte maturation.

## Explain the relationship between immature microglia and cortical inhibitory interneurons. Additionally, discuss if postnatal depletion of microglia produces the same effects.

In the presence of immature microglia, there is a substantial loss of cortical inhibitory interneurons. However, the postnatal depletion of microglia does not result in the phenotypes observed in mice with immature microglia.

## How is the modulation of microglial immune responses different between human and rodent models?

In rodent models, pathways such as the TGF $\beta$-mediated suppression of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression can be detected. This pathway is absent in human microglia. Specific immune genes exclusively found in human microglia include $F C \gamma$, TAL1, IFI16, SIGLEC-11, and SIGLEC-3.

## What are the challenges in isolating homeostatic human microglia for comparative studies?

Comparative studies may be influenced by the difficulty of isolating homeostatic human microglia, which are often derived from post-mortem brains or disease-associated surgical biopsies. As such, senescence or pathology-associated cues may affect the transcriptional and functional settings of the analyzed microglia.

## What are the key issues with using immortalized human microglial cell lines for research?

Immortalized human microglial cell lines only partially reflect human microglia properties due to the loss of antigenic characteristics critically involved in proliferation and homeostasis.

## Discuss the protocols established for generating human microglia-like cells (hiMGLs) from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).

Since 2016, various protocols have been developed to generate mature microglia-like cells from hiPSCs. These protocols aim to mimic the primary human counterparts regarding characteristic signature genes expression and functionality, such as proliferation, migration, motility, integration into neural tissue, inflammatory reactions, and phagocytosis.
