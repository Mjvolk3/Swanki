## It has been hypothesized that the exposure of neural progenitor cell (NPC)-conditioned medium to developing hiMGLs might mimic the environmental cues as microglia develop in synchrony with neurons. What is the effect of NPC-conditioned medium on hiMGL maturation?

The exposure to NPC-conditioned medium results in the higher expression of TMEM119 compared with unconditioned media or astrocyte and oligodendrocyte precursor-conditioned media.

## What role might TGF $\beta$ signaling play in the maturation of hiMGLs?

Although not further investigated, TGF $\beta$ signaling may be partly responsible for the observed effects, as this factor is continuously secreted by developing and adult neural tissue.

## Describe the effect of fibronectin coating on iMGL morphology compared to other coatings.

Fibronectin coating results in a more ramified morphology compared to poly-D-lysine, collagen I, gelatin, and laminin coating.

## How do (soluble) CD200 and chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1 (CX3CL1) affect microglia?

The additional treatment with (soluble) CD200 and chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1 (CX3CL1) in combination resulted only in minor changes in microglia signature genes, indicating that these factors influence microglial functions rather than differentiation or maturation.

## What is one of the prerequisites for using hiMGLs to study human microglia?

The prerequisite is that these in vitro generated hiMGLs share the full molecular signatures as their in vivo counterparts.

## Compare the purposes of NPC-conditioned medium and (soluble) CD200 and CX3CL1 treatment.

NPC-conditioned medium is hypothesized to facilitate hiMGL maturation by mimicking environmental cues, leading to higher TMEM119 expression. In contrast, (soluble) CD200 and CX3CL1 affect microglial functions but do not significantly influence differentiation or maturation.
