## What is the role of TGF-β1 in microglial development in vitro and which receptors mediate its actions?

TGF-β1 regulates rodent microglial development, homeostasis, maturation, and survival. These actions are mediated by the TGF β-receptor 1 (TGFBR1), highly expressed by both rodent microglia cultures and hiMGLs.

## What are the effects of TGF-β1 withdrawal from hiMGL medium?

The withdrawal of TGF-β1 from hiMGL medium reduces the expression of surface receptors encoding genes such as P2RY12, TGFBR1, CX3CR1, GPR84, and CD33, as well as microglial transcription factors EGR1 and ETV5.

## What happens 24 hours after TGF-β1 treatment in terms of gene expression?

24 hours after TGF-β1 treatment, more than 2000 genes are found to be differentially expressed. Many of these genes are associated with neurodegenerative diseases and include AD GWAS loci genes such as TREM2 and APOE, indicating the relevance of TGF-β1 for microglial homeostasis and maintenance.

## How does IDE1 mimic the actions of TGF-β1?

IDE1, a stable small molecule, can mediate the phosphorylation of TGF-β downstream signaling. The substitution of TGF-β1 by IDE1 results in similar growth kinetics and higher IDE1 concentrations can further increase cell proliferation. Gene expression analysis shows that IDE1-treated iMGLs cluster closely with TGF-β1-treated iMGLs and even more with fetal and adult microglia.

## What is the impact of using 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in hiMGL differentiation protocols?

The use of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented medium might contain 1-2 ng/mL of TGF-β, which supports the microglia maturation process. This can potentially contribute to the development of immature hiMGLs by providing "hidden" TGF-β effects and regulating microglial activation.

## How do cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions influence hiMGL differentiation and maturation?

Neuronal and astrocyte-derived signals may influence microglial identity and are crucial for generating fully maturated hiMGLs. For example, direct co-culture with neurons results in the expression of human-specific SIGLEC11 and SIGLEC12, which interact with the neuronal glycocalyx, suppressing inflammation and maintaining microglia in a homeostatic state. Moreover, co-culture leads to a more dynamically ramified morphology and enhanced migration abilities, indicating neuron-mediated homeostasis.
