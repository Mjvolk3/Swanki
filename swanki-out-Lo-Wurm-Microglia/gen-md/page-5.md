## What role does Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) play in mesodermal differentiation of hiPSCs?

Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) is a critical molecule that induces the mesodermal differentiation of hiPSCs and is used in nearly all published protocols.

## Explain the dual role of Wnt signaling in HPC generation and the differentiation of hemangioblasts into primitive hematopoietic stem cells.

Wnt signaling initially fosters the differentiation of hemangioblasts, but negatively regulates the subsequent differentiation into ${ \text{primitive KDR}^{+} \text{CD} 235^{+} \text{hematopoietic stem cells} }$. Therefore, Wnt-agonists are initially used for mesodermal differentiation and then switched to Wnt-antagonists to reflect natural embryonic development.

## What is the significance of reduced oxygen levels during initial hematopoietic differentiation of hiPSCs?

Reduced oxygen levels ($5 \% \mathrm{O_2}$) during initial hematopoietic differentiation have been shown to robustly differentiate into myeloid progenitors. It is argued that $\mathrm{O_2}$ reduction mimics the environment within embryoid bodies (EBs) impacting progenitor cells in the inner cell mass.

## How do growth factors such as VEGF influence the differentiation of hiMGLs in initial hematopoietic differentiation?

VEGF treatment during the initial hematopoietic differentiation stage enhances CD45 and $\mathrm{Cx3Cr1}$ expression in differentiated hiMGLs. This indicates the need for fine-tuning the growth factor cocktails for effective differentiation.

## Explain the timing and role of cytokines in generating myeloid progenitors in conventional monolayer cultures.

In conventional monolayer cultures, a time-dependent mix of cytokines including Flt3, GCSF, IL-3, IL-6, SCF, VEGF, and TPO is used to generate sufficient myeloid progenitors. The specific timing and combination of these cytokines are crucial for generating functional progenitors.

$$ \text{Cytokines used: Flt3, GCSF, IL-3, IL-6, SCF, VEGF, TPO} $$

## List key markers for myeloid and hematopoietic differentiation that appear during the differentiation process.

As a result of differentiation, key markers such as CD117, CD34, CD235, CD41, CD43, and CD14 appear during the process. The timing of their appearance varies between protocols.

$$ \text{Markers: CD117, CD34, CD235, CD41, CD43, CD14} $$
