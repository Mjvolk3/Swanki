macrophages at the first wave of hematopoiesis (for an overview of mouse microglia development and maturation, see Figure 1) [1]. These cells develop from early erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) in the yolk sac at embryonic day E8.5 in a PU.1- and Irf8-dependent manner [2]. Unlike monocyte-derived macrophages, these primitive macrophages do not require the transcription factor Myb for their development [3]. They initially express the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit and lack the expression of CD45 and gradually lose c-Kit expression, while increasing the expression of CD45 during their further maturation [1,4]. Overlapping with the establishment of the primary blood circulation system, primitive macrophages start to migrate towards the neural tube to populate the developing brain and the spinal cord around E9.5, where they finally give rise to microglia [1,3]. This crucial migration step is dependent on the neuronal expression and secretion of Interleukin 34 (IL-34), which is sensed by the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (Csf1r) being expressed by EMPs and developing microglia [1,5]. Moreover, microglial Csf1r signaling is further essential to mediate the survival of adult microglia [6]. In addition to the above-mentioned factors, the signal-dependent transcription factors Maf, Mef2c, and Sall1 are critical for proper microglia development [7-9].

Along with the establishment of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) prenatally and after birth, the microglia population increases in the first postnatal weeks due to intraparenchymal proliferation and is further maintained in the adult CNS by a constant balance between microglial proliferation and apoptosis [10,11]. Under healthy physiological conditions, there is virtually no contribution of progenitors and/or monocytes recruited from peripheral blood circulation to maintain and support stable microglia numbers [12,13]. The gut microbiome, as well as the interaction of maturing microglia with various cell types within distinct developing CNS regions during the first postnatal weeks, is critical for the establishment of a region-specific microglia heterogeneity $[14,15]$.

After prenatal microglial colonization of the brain parenchyma and subsequent preand postnatal microglial proliferation, the maturation process of these cells is further characterized by the induction and establishment of a microglia-specific gene expression pattern that distinguishes them from other macrophage populations [16-21]. These microgliaenriched genes are referred to as microglia homeostatic markers and are expressed by adult microglia under physiological conditions throughout different brain regions [22]. The expression of these genes, including Tmem119, Olfml3, P2yr12, Sall1, Hexb, Gpr34, Fcrls, or SiglecH, is upregulated within the first two postnatal weeks in mice and correlates with the activation of TGF $\beta$ signaling in microglia [18]. Immunohistochemistry and transgenic approaches have suggested neuron-derived TGF $\beta 1$ and TGF $\beta 2$ released by NG2-glia to be critically involved in triggering postnatal microglia maturation [18,23]. Further studies have clearly demonstrated that TGF $\beta 1$ is essential for microglia development [24] and maturation [25]. The deletion of TGF $\beta 1$ expression in the CNS [17], impairment of extracellular TGF $\beta 1$ processing and activation [26,27], or silencing of microglial TGF $\beta 1$ signaling by deletion of the TGF $\beta 1$ receptor Tgfbr2 [28] resulted in a loss of microglia maturation, characterized by a lack of homeostatic microglia marker expression. Moreover, affected microglia further display an inflammatory phenotype, as evidenced by the increased expression of $A p o E, A x l, C y b b, C d 74, H 2-A a$, or $I l 1 b$, further emphasizing the importance of microglial TGF $\beta$ signaling to regulate microglia reactivity [28,29]. Although the functional significance of most of the homeostatic microglia markers is not well understood, the expression of these microglia-enriched genes strongly suggests their importance for mediating microglia functions, especially under physiological conditions [22,25]. This hypothesis is further supported by recent reports demonstrating the expression of the purinergic receptor $P 2$ ry12 to be essential to promote microglial-driven neuroprotection and to support neuronal functions by dynamic interactions with synapses, as well as the microglia-mediated maintenance of BBB integrity after cerebrovascular damage [30,31]. Although TGF $\beta 1$ and microglial TGF $\beta$ signaling have been well established as crucial
