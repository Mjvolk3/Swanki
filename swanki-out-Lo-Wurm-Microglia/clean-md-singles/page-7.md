3.3. TGFÃŸ in Microglia Differentiation and Maturation In Vitro
}

In the developing brain, TGF $\beta 1$ has been shown to regulate rodent microglial development, homeostasis, maturation, and survival $[17,24,25,75]$. These actions are mediated by the TGF $\beta$-receptor 1 (TGFBR1), which is highly expressed by both rodent microglia cultures and hiMGLs [55]. Therefore, TGF $\beta 1$ was considered as an important maturation factor for immature hiMGLs in distinct hiMGL differentiation protocols at concentrations ranging from 2 to $50 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$, and its effects have been addressed in detail (Figure 3) [55,56,62,76].

The withdrawal of TGF $\beta$ from hiMGL medium reduces the expression of surface receptors encoding genes P2RY12, TGFBR1, CX3CR1, GPR84, and CD33, as well as microglial transcription factors EGR1 and ETV5 [55]. In total, 24 h after TGF $\beta$ treatment, more than 2000 genes were found to be differentially expressed [55]. Interestingly, many of these genes are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The removal of TGF $\beta$ leads to significant changes that have been identified as Alzheimer's disease (AD) GWAS loci genes, including TREM2 and APOE, indicating the relevance of TGF $\beta$ for microglial homeostasis and maintenance [55]. Based on these data, pathways regulating mitosis and proliferation are also modulated by TGF $\beta$ treatment [55] similar to observations in mice [75]. Finally, the differentiation and proliferation of already differentiating hiMGLs are significantly diminished when TGF $\beta$ is withdrawn in vitro [62].

Intriguingly, TGF $\beta$ actions can be mimicked by incubation with a more stable small molecule, "Inducer of Definitive Endoderm1" (IDE1), mediating the phosphorylation of TGF $\beta$ downstream signaling [77]. It is noteworthy that the substitution of TGF $\beta$ by IDE1 results in similar growth kinetics compared with TGF $\beta$ treatment and higher IDE1 concentrations, further increasing cell proliferation. Correlation analysis demonstrates that gene expression of IDE1-treated iMGLs cluster with TGF $\beta$-treated iMGLs and even more with fetal and adult microglia [62].

Although TGF $\beta$ has not been added as a recombinant cytokine in all hiMGL protocols, the use of $10 \%$ fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented medium in distinct differentiation protocols might contain $1-2 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ of TGF $\beta$ [78], supporting the microglia maturation process $[64,68]$. In this context, the further development of immature hiMGLs could benefit from these "hidden" TGF $\beta$ effects, and its well-described functions to regulate microglial activation might additionally play important roles [79].

\subsection*{3.4. Cell-Cell and Cell-Matrix Interactions in hiMGL Differentiation and Maturation In Vitro}

Since even fine-tuned culture media do not fully reproduce the complex microglial niche in the developing three-dimensional brain, neuronal and astrocyte-derived signals have been hypothesized to influence microglial identity and may also be crucial for the generation of fully maturated hiMGLs. Principle component analysis of the transcriptome reveals that hiMGLs exposed to hiPSC-derived mature neuron-conditioned medium slightly shift their transcriptome to fetal microglia [54]. Direct co-culture with neurons results in the expression of human-specific sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin (SIGLEC) 11 and SIGLEC 12 that interact with the neuronal glycocalyx, suppressing inflammation, and thus, may maintain microglia in a homeostatic state [55]. Additionally, the co-culture of neurons and hiMGLs results in a more dynamically ramified morphology and enhanced migration abilities, as well as an overall reduced secretion of chemokines and cytokines, indicating mechanisms of neuron-mediated homeostasis [58]. A recent study comparing neuron-astrocyte co-culture vs. monocultured iMGLs shows that microglial signature gene expression is barely different among these groups, indicating that both approaches can lead to fully differentiated microglia [76]. However, genes related to so-called "disease-associated microglia" (DAM) have been upregulated in the monoculture group, including TREM2 that is a "risk gene" for neurodegenerative diseases. This indicates that cell-cell interactions are not necessary for the differentiation and maturation of iMGLs, but for adopting a homeostatic in vivo-like state.
