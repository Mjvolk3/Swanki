way for a reliable and more robust in vitro generation of microglia sharing the typical expression signature, as well as functionality with their in vivo counterparts. This will also be a prerequisite for the deeper understanding of the molecular background of (human) microglia, including their putative contribution to neurodegenerative diseases. This point will be even more relevant for the possibility to employ hiMGLs for future microglia replacement strategies.

In particular, recent achievements underlining the importance of TGF $\beta 1$ and microglial TGF $\beta$ signaling need to be considered in hiMGL differentiation protocols, and further studies addressing the specific effects of TGF $\beta 1$ in human microglia and hiMGLs have to be performed in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying TGF $\beta 1$-mediated effects. Moreover, the benefit of TGF $\beta 1$ as an additional factor for hiMGL maturation has to be analyzed and validated in more detail in order to generate hiMGLs that share essential features of human microglia in vivo.
