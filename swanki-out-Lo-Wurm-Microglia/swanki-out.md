## What is the impact of using 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in hiMGL differentiation protocols?

The use of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented medium might contain 1-2 ng/mL of TGF-β, which supports the microglia maturation process. This can potentially contribute to the development of immature hiMGLs by providing "hidden" TGF-β effects and regulating microglial activation.

### 6.

## How do cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions influence hiMGL differentiation and maturation?

Neuronal and astrocyte-derived signals may influence microglial identity and are crucial for generating fully maturated hiMGLs. For example, direct co-culture with neurons results in the expression of human-specific SIGLEC11 and SIGLEC12, which interact with the neuronal glycocalyx, suppressing inflammation and maintaining microglia in a homeostatic state. Moreover, co-culture leads to a more dynamically ramified morphology and enhanced migration abilities, indicating neuron-mediated homeostasis.

Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) influences the maturation of human-induced microglia-like cells (hiMGL) through both Smad signaling and potentially non-Smad pathways. The diagram shows different sources of TGF-β, including recombinant TGF-β, neuronal TGF-β secretion, and fetal bovine serum (FBS), affecting hiMGL maturity via TGFβR1 and TGFβR2 receptors. After maturation, hiMGLs express cell surface receptors and molecules such as TMEM119, P2RY12, SIGLEC 11, SIGLEC 12, TGFβR1, CX3CR1, CD33, GPR84, and transcription factors like EGR1 and ETV5.

Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) influences the maturation of human-induced microglia-like cells (hiMGL) via TGFβR1 and TGFβR2 receptors. The schematic diagram shows that TGF-β, sourced from recombinant TGF-β, neuronal TGF-β secretion, or fetal bovine serum (FBS), impacts immature hiMGL through Smad signaling and potentially non-Smad pathways (indicated by question marks). Upon maturation, hiMGL displays various cell surface receptors and molecules, including TMEM119, P2RY12, SIGLEC 11, SIGLEC 12, TGFβR1, CX3CR1, CD33, GPR84, and transcription factors like EGR1 and ETV5.

The schematic indicates that TGF-β signals its effects on hiMGL maturation primarily through Smad signaling pathways. Additionally, there might be other non-Smad pathways involved, but these are not clearly identified in the diagram (suggested by the question marks). These pathways contribute to the maturation of hiMGL, characterized by the development of specific cell surface receptors and transcription factors.

## Describe the importance of TGF $\beta 1$ in the differentiation protocols for hiMGLs.

TGF $\beta 1$ is essential in hiMGL differentiation protocols due to its role in microglial TGF $\beta$ signaling, which has significant effects on human microglia and hiMGLs. Research shows that it is crucial to further address these effects to understand the molecular mechanisms behind TGF $\beta 1$-mediated impacts.

## Mention a factor that needs detailed analysis and validation to generate hiMGLs akin to human microglia in vivo.

The benefit of TGF $\beta 1$ as an additional factor for hiMGL maturation needs to be analyzed and validated in more detail to generate hiMGLs that share essential features of human microglia in vivo.
