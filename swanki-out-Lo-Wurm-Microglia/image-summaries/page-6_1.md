ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts a schematic representation of the basic differentiation strategies used for converting human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into human-induced microglia-like cells (hiMGLs). The process is broken down into various stages illustrating the transition from hiPSC to mesenchymal stem cells, primitive hematopoietic stem cells, MYB-independent myeloid progenitors, and finally to immature and mature microglia.

The image also shows the various culture methods (monolayer culture and embryoid body formation), signaling molecules, cytokines, and growth factors (such as BMP4, Wnt-Agonists/Antagonists, SCF, VEGF, and others) that are used at each step to guide the differentiation process. Additionally, references to scientific work are included below each step, and the graphic indicates that a neural co-culture system is used towards the end of the differentiation process to help achieve maturation of the microglia-like cells.

The figure was created using BioRender, and the ability to visualize the differentiation process provides researchers with a clear understanding of the steps and components involved in generating hiMGLs for potential research and therapeutic purposes.
