ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a schematic illustration detailing the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and maturation of mouse microglia in vivo. The illustration maps out a developmental timeline, showing key stages and factors important for microglial progression.

In the top left corner, originating from the yolk sac, early microglial progenitors are depicted with markers such as c-Kit and lacking CD45. They require transcription factors such as PU.1 and Irf8 to develop. Other factors like Maf, Mef2c, and Sall1 are also indicated as important for the development of microglia. These progenitors receive signaling cues from Interleukin 34 (IL-34) and Csf1r, which facilitate their migration towards the embryonic central nervous system.

In the top right area of the illustration, we see the further development of these progenitor cells within the embryonic brain, influenced by factors such as TGFβ1 (Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1). It is suggested that components like the gut microbiome may also influence this development process, although this is represented with a question mark, indicating uncertainty or a potential for further research.

The bottom portion of the image, labeled "Postnatal CNS (P7-P28)," describes the period after birth when microglial cells mature within the central nervous system. Mature microglia express a homeostatic signature made up of genes like Tmem119, Olfml3, P2yr12, Sall1, Hexb, Gpr34, Fcrls, and SiglecH. These genes typically ramp up in expression within the first two postnatal weeks. TGFβ1 signaling, especially through neuron-derived factors and NG2 glia, is emphasized as a critical trigger for microglia maturation. The illustration shows microglial cells interacting with neurons and contributing to neuron support, and facilitating the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, as well as migration and proliferation of microglial cells.
