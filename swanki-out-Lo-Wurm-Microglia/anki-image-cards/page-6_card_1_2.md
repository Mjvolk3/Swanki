Figure 2 illustrates the basic differentiation strategies of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into human-induced microglia-like cells (hiMGLs). This schematic breaks down the stages from hiPSCs to mesenchymal stem cells, to primitive hematopoietic stem cells, MYB-independent myeloid progenitors, and finally to immature and mature microglia. The figure also details the culture methods (monolayer culture and embryoid body formation), signaling molecules, cytokines, and growth factors (e.g., BMP4, Wnt-Agonists/Antagonists, SCF, VEGF) used at each step, and references supporting scientific work. Additionally, it highlights the use of a neural co-culture system towards the end of differentiation to aid the maturation of microglia-like cells.

The key culture methods used in the differentiation of hiPSCs to hiMGLs, as displayed in Figure 2, include monolayer culture and embryoid body formation. The essential signaling molecules, cytokines, and growth factors involved in guiding this process are BMP4, Wnt-Agonists/Antagonists, SCF, VEGF, among others. Additionally, the differentiation process incorporates the use of a neural co-culture system to promote the maturation of the microglia-like cells.
