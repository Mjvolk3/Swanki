Key factors involved in the postnatal maturation of microglia include astrocyte-derived IL33 and the presence of $\mathrm{CD}^{+} \mathrm{T}$ cells in the CNS. Additionally, TGFÎ²1 signaling, neuron-derived factors, and NG2 glia play crucial roles.

Mature microglia in the postnatal CNS express a homeostatic signature made up of genes such as Tmem119, Olfml3, P2yr12, Sall1, Hexb, Gpr34, Fcrls, and SiglecH. These genes typically ramp up in expression within the first two postnatal weeks.
