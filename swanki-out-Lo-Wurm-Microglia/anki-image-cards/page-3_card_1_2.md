Early microglial progenitors, originating from the yolk sac, are characterized by markers such as c-Kit and lack of CD45. Their development requires transcription factors like PU.1 and Irf8. Other important factors include Maf, Mef2c, Sall1, Interleukin 34 (IL-34), and Csf1r.

## Which genes express the homeostatic signature in postnatal microglia and what signaling is critical during this period?

In the postnatal CNS (P7-P28), mature microglia express genes associated with a homeostatic signature, including Tmem119, Olfml3, P2yr12, Sall1, Hexb, Gpr34, Fcrls, and SiglecH. TGFÎ²1 signaling, particularly through neuron-derived factors and NG2 glia, is critical for microglial maturation during this period.
