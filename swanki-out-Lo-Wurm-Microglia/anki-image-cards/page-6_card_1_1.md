The image depicts the differentiation strategies of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into human-induced microglia-like cells (hiMGLs). The process includes stages from hiPSC to mesenchymal stem cells, primitive hematopoietic stem cells, MYB-independent myeloid progenitors, and finally to immature and mature microglia. It incorporates culture methods (monolayer culture, embryoid body formation) and various signaling molecules, cytokines, and growth factors (such as BMP4, Wnt-Agonists/Antagonists, SCF, VEGF). Additionally, a neural co-culture system is used towards the end of the process for maturation.
