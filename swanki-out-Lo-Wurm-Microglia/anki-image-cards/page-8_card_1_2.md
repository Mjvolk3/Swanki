Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) influences the maturation of human-induced microglia-like cells (hiMGL) via TGFβR1 and TGFβR2 receptors. The schematic diagram shows that TGF-β, sourced from recombinant TGF-β, neuronal TGF-β secretion, or fetal bovine serum (FBS), impacts immature hiMGL through Smad signaling and potentially non-Smad pathways (indicated by question marks). Upon maturation, hiMGL displays various cell surface receptors and molecules, including TMEM119, P2RY12, SIGLEC 11, SIGLEC 12, TGFβR1, CX3CR1, CD33, GPR84, and transcription factors like EGR1 and ETV5.

## Describe the signaling pathways mentioned in the schematic that mediate the effects of TGF-β on hiMGL maturation.

The schematic indicates that TGF-β signals its effects on hiMGL maturation primarily through Smad signaling pathways. Additionally, there might be other non-Smad pathways involved, but these are not clearly identified in the diagram (suggested by the question marks). These pathways contribute to the maturation of hiMGL, characterized by the development of specific cell surface receptors and transcription factors.
