Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) influences the maturation of human-induced microglia-like cells (hiMGL) through both Smad signaling and potentially non-Smad pathways. The diagram shows different sources of TGF-β, including recombinant TGF-β, neuronal TGF-β secretion, and fetal bovine serum (FBS), affecting hiMGL maturity via TGFβR1 and TGFβR2 receptors. After maturation, hiMGLs express cell surface receptors and molecules such as TMEM119, P2RY12, SIGLEC 11, SIGLEC 12, TGFβR1, CX3CR1, CD33, GPR84, and transcription factors like EGR1 and ETV5.
