Human microglia are less proliferative than mouse microglia and primary cultures from biopsies could be contaminated by peripheral myeloid populations, thereby affecting comparability in functional analysis.

Immortalized human microglial cell lines only partially reflect human microglia properties due to the loss of some antigenic characteristics crucial for proliferation and homeostasis.
