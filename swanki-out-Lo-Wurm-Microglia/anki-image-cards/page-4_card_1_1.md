What are some challenges mentioned in generating and analyzing human microglia in vitro?

%

Some challenges include:

- Senescence or pathology-associated cues may influence transcriptional and functional settings.
- Activated states of microglia may impede comparability between mouse and human models.
- Adult human microglia are less proliferative compared to mouse homologues.
- Poor survival of microglia from small biopsies leading to very low cell numbers.
- Potential contamination by peripheral myeloid populations.
- Immortalized human microglial cell lines do not fully reflect the properties of human microglia due to the loss of some antigenic characteristics.

What advancements have been made since 2016 regarding the in vitro generation of human microglia-like cells?

%

Since 2016, many protocols have been established for the in vitro generation of mature microglia-like cells. These protocols aim to mimic primary human microglia concerning the expression of characteristic signature genes and functions, including:

- Proliferation
- Migration
- Motility
- Integration into neural tissue
- Inflammatory reactions
- Phagocytosis
