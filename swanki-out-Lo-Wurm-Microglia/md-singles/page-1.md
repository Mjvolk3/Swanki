\begin{abstract}
Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system and play critical roles during the development, homeostasis, and pathologies of the brain. Originated from yolk sac erythromyeloid progenitors, microglia immigrate into the embryonic brain parenchyma to undergo final postnatal differentiation and maturation driven by distinct chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors. Among them, TGF \(\beta 1\) is an important regulator of microglial functions, mediating homeostasis, anti-inflammation, and triggering the expression of microglial homeostatic signature genes. Since microglia studies are mainly based on rodent cells and the isolation of homeostatic microglia from human tissue is challenging, human-induced pluripotent stem cells have been successfully differentiated into microglia-like cells recently. However, employed differentiation protocols strongly vary regarding used cytokines and growth factors, culture conditions, time span, and cell yield. Moreover, the incomplete differentiation of human microglia can hamper the similarity to primary human microglia and dramatically influence the outcome of follow-up studies with these differentiated cells. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms driving rodent microglia differentiation in vivo, further compares published differentiation protocols, and highlights the potential of TGF \(\beta\) as an essential maturation factor.

\section*{1. Introduction}

Microglia are a specialized subset of myeloid cells and represent the resident immune cell population of the central nervous system (CNS). Recent achievements in deciphering the development and differentiation of microglia have resulted in various protocols to generate human microglia-like cells (hiMGLs) from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in vitro. Although these approaches result in hiMGLs that-at least partiallyshare the molecular signatures with human microglia in vivo, available differentiation protocols should consider recent findings elucidating microglia development and maturation in vivo. Here, we summarize the mechanisms of microglia differentiation in mice and compare various protocols using hiPSCs to generate hiMGLs in vitro. Special focus is given on the role of transforming growth factor \(\beta 1\) (TGF \(\beta 1\) ), its essential functions during microglia maturation, and its potential as an indispensable factor for the generation hiMGLs. The maturation of these cells closely mimicking resident human microglia is a prerequisite for future functional studies and may also pave the way for future microglia replacement strategies in humans.

In contrast to other macrophage populations, microglia and CNS-associated resident macrophages (border-associated macrophages (BAMs)) originate from primitive
