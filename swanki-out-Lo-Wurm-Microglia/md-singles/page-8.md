It has been hypothesized that the exposure of neural progenitor cell (NPC)-conditioned medium to developing hiMGLs might mimic the environmental cues as microglia develop in synchrony with neurons [65]. In fact, hiMGL maturation with NPC-conditioned medium results in the higher expression of TMEM119 compared with unconditioned media or astrocyte and oligodendrocyte precursor-conditioned media.

Although not further investigated, TGF \(\beta\) signaling may be partly responsible for these effects, as this factor is continuously secreted by developing and adult neural tissue \([18,23,80]\). However, the molecular mechanisms of direct and indirect interactions of hiPSCs with neural cells boosting their differentiation and maturation for in vitro applications remain to be studied in more detail.

Additional factors affecting iMGL differentiation and maturation have been analyzed in single studies, i.e., addressing the potential of the extracellular matrix. In fact, fibronectin coating results in a more ramified morphology compared to poly-D-lsine, collagen I, gelatin, and laminin coating. Furthermore, additional treatment with (soluble) CD200 and chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1 (CX3CL1) in combination did only result in minor changes of microglia signature genes, indicating that these factors influence microglial functions rather than differentiation or maturation [55,76].

4. Summary and Conclusions

Taken together, the generation of hiMGLs from hiPSC closely resembles the welldescribed microglia differentiation and maturation processes observed in mice and thus might represent a powerful tool for studying the functional aspects of human microglia. However, the prerequisite for such studies using hiMGLs is that these in vitro generated cells share the full molecular signatures as their in vivo counterparts. To overcome the limitations of human in vivo studies, comparative analysis of hiMGLs and mouse-derived iMGLs should be performed, examining common and divergent maturation pathways.

For a better understanding of specific developmental and maturation mechanisms, the molecular crosstalk of (how certain known and unknown) homeostatic and maturation modulators guiding the specification of microglial phenotypes at certain developmental stages and in different brain regions in mice should be dissected in more detail. The subsequent translation of these investigations to differentiation protocols will pave the
