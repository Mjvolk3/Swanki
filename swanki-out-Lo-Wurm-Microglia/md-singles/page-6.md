3.2. Final Microglia Differentiation and Maturation In Vitro
}

The final microglia differentiation is mainly induced by switching the cytokine cocktail to IL-34 and macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) for at least 10 to 30 days, in accordance with in vivo observations of microglia survival to be dependent on the activation of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) [55,58,62-64]. As IL-34 instead of its natural ligand colony stimulating factor (CSF1) has been shown to play a major role in microglial differentiation in mice [1,71,72], this cytokine has been used in most protocols at high concentrations ( \(100 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}\) ), and the removal of this factor leads to depletion of the hiMGLs [58].

IL-34 and MCSF in combination lead to the expression of MERTK, ITGB5, CX3CR1, TGFBR1, IBA1, CD11b, and TMEM119, all of which are markers associated with immature and mature microglia [55]. Notably, a set of genes reported to be specific for the human microglial signature, including MERTK, GPR34, PROS1, C1QA, GAS6, and P2RY12 [17], has been detected at similar or even higher levels compared to primary adult human microglia \([58,59]\). This expression pattern greatly differs from blood-derived monocytes (PBMC) and PBMC-derived macrophages [57]. However, most of these genes are not only expressed in hiMGLs but also in hiPSC-derived macrophages [58], indicating that such genes may not be exclusively expressed by microglia.

CSF1 instead of IL-34 can also mediate hiMGL survival in vitro [54,60], highlighting the problem of putative species differences. As murine cytokines do not effectively bind to hiMGL receptors, mice carrying the human transgenes encoding CSF1 have been generated to solve this problem. In fact, a successful hiPSC integration into the mouse tissue was dependent on the presence of human CSF1, indicating the pivotal role of CSF1R stimulation for human microglial differentiation by its "natural" ligand instead of IL-34 [73]. In addition to recombinant CSF-1 or IL-34, which seem to be critically involved in hiMGL survival [58], their cardinal role for hiMGL differentiation remains questionable due to observations of final microglial differentiation, solely supported by coculture with human astrocytes [59]. Thus, it remains to be resolved whether this could be executed by an astrocytic secretome, as a mix of various factors, including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), IL-6, IL-8, and TGF \(\beta\), that have been detected using an array for 32 human cytokines (not including IL-34 and MCSF) [74].
