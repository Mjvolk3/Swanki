drivers of postnatal microglia maturation, it is likely that further molecular and cellular cues might be involved in final microglia differentiation and maturation processes in mice and humans. In addition, recent reports have described astrocyte-derived IL33 and the presence of \(\mathrm{CD}^{+} \mathrm{T}\) cells in the CNS to be of critical importance for postnatal microglia maturation [32,33]. These recent studies indicate the molecular complexity involved in microglia maturation and further underpin the importance of future studies aiming to elucidate these mechanisms controlling the terminal developmental process.

\subsection*{2.3. Functional Consequences of Impaired Microglial Maturation}

Even though it is evident that microglia play a role in various CNS pathologies [22,34], although their exact role is not established in disease progression, still, their functions during CNS development and maintenance under physiological conditions remain unclear and is a major challenge in the microglia field. To date, microglia have been demonstrated to play important roles during pre- and postnatal CNS development by performing the synaptic pruning and active control of neuronal circuit formation [35-37], support of neuron survival and oligodendrocyte-mediated postnatal myelination [38,39], and promotion of learning-dependent synapse formation and maintenance of synapse function and integrity \([40,41]\). It is likely that these processes only represent a part of the full functional repertoire of microglia and that future studies will shed light on additional essential microglia functions in health. Furthermore, the above-mentioned recently found microglia roles suggest that impaired microglial maturation could also have detrimental consequences for postnatal CNS development.
