by adjusting the oxygen levels and/or progenitor isolation based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS).

The differentiation steps are summarized in Figure 2 and comprise the mesodermal differentiation of hiPSC into hemangioblasts and later into primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HPC) that are comparable to yolk sac EMPs during human microglia development [1,2].

A critical molecule inducing the mesodermal differentiation of hiPSCs is bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), which is used in nearly all protocols published. Additionally, mesodermal specification is supported by stem cell factor (SCF) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

Wnt signaling has been implicated to affect HPC generation. While the initial differentiation of hemangioblasts is fostered by Wnt signaling [66], consecutive differentiation into primitive kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) \({ }^{+} \mathrm{CD} 235^{+}\)hematopoetic stem cells [67] that give rise to the yolk sac progenitors (in contrast to definitive \(\mathrm{KDR}^{+} \mathrm{CD} 235^{-}\)hematopoetic stem cells) is negatively regulated by Wnt-signaling. Therefore, Wnt-agonists were initially used for mesenchymal hiPSC differentiation, but treatment was switched to Wntantagonists reflecting the embryonic development \([60,64,68]\). Interestingly, this switch must occur in a very precise time window that, surprisingly, greatly differs from 18-24 \(\mathrm{h}\) [68], \(40-48 \mathrm{~h}\) [64], and 6 days [60] among the protocols.

In another study, definitive hematopoiesis was induced by the application of Wntactivator BIO and Activin-inhibitor SB431542 directly after mesodermal induction. This results in a significantly decreased number of cells expressing the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), further indicating that hiMGLs can only be generated using the primitive hematopoietic stem cell lineage [56]. Using small molecules for the activation and inhibition of stage-specific pathways may be an opportunity for fine-tuning existing hiMGL differentiation protocols.

In a second step, sufficient myeloid progenitors can be generated in conventional monolayer cultures by using a time-dependent mix of cytokines, that comprises fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), IL-3, IL-6, SCF, VEGF, and thrombopoietin (TPO) \([57,62,63]\). Although their impact on mesodermal and myeloid differentiation is well characterized, individual and comprehensive implications on differentiation into hiMGLs are not well understood. However, differentiated hiMGLs that have been treated with VEGF during initial hematopoietic differentiation show enhanced CD45 and \(\mathrm{Cx3Cr1}\) expression, implicating the need for fine-tuning the growth factor cocktails during early differentiation [69]. However, essential markers for homeostatic functions, including Iba1, CD11b, and P2RY12, have not been influenced in this case.

In addition to growth factor and cytokine treatment, reduced oxygen levels \(\left(5 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)\) during initial hematopoietic differentiation have also been shown to provide robust differentiation into myeloid progenitors [55,59,60,64]. Accordingly, it has been argued that \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) reduction may occur upon the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs) accounting for the progenitors in the inner cell mass [70]. This culture method is accompanied by cell-cell and / or cell-matrix interactions that may be beneficial for myeloid differentiation. Once the BMP4-driven mesenchymal differentiation of EBs is initiated, the growth factor and cytokine-cocktail for subsequent myeloid differentiation can be minimized to generate functional hiMGLs [56,58].

In contrast to other protocols, Muffat et al. grew iPSCs in a defined base medium chemically reflecting the cerebrospinal fluid and supplemented purely with CSF1 and IL-34, which are commonly not used until the terminal microglia differentiation. Nevertheless, EB formation spontaneously results in the formation of NPC spheroids, but also yolk sac-EBs, showing myeloid expression profiles [54].

As a result of hematopoietic and subsequent myeloid differentiation, the cells start to express CD117 and CD34 followed by CD235, CD41 [54,55,60,64], CD43 [55,59,62], and CD14 [57,63]. The time of appearance of myeloid progenitors greatly differs among protocols, ranging from 8 to 30 days, depending on the broad or frugal use of stage-specific growth factors and cytokines [58,64].
