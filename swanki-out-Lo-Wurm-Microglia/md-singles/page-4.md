Indeed, the loss of microglial TGF \(\beta\) signaling has been described to result in the development of spastic motor deficits as a consequence of impaired postnatal myelination of grey and white matter tracts, which is caused by disturbed oligodendrocyte maturation [28]. Moreover, in the presence of immature microglia, a substantial loss of cortical inhibitory interneurons has been demonstrated [28]. Supporting the hypothesis that the impairment of microglial maturation has detrimental effects on CNS development, the postnatal depletion of microglia did not result in the phenotypes observed in mice with immature microglia [28]. Taken together, these results underline the importance of the establishment of the homeostatic microglia-enriched gene expression signature for CNS development and postnatal maturation. This further suggests that a full microglia maturation phenotype needs to be induced in microglia-like cells generated from human iPSCs for subsequent functional analyses and / or replacement studies to better mimic the full spectrum of in vivo microglia.

3. Generation of Human Microglia-Like Cells (hiMGLs) from Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs)

The current knowledge about microglia development is mainly based on experimental animal studies performed in rodents with minor support from a few studies of aborted human embryos [42,43]. Although human and rodent microglia share most of their key functions and expression profiles, differences at a regulatory level have been identified. Pathways primarily involved in the modulation of microglial immune responses, such as the TGF \(\beta\)-mediated suppression of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression [44], can only be detected in mouse models. By contrast, several immune genes, including \(F C \gamma\), TAL1 and IFI16 [45], SIGLEC-11 [46], and SIGLEC-3 [47], have been identified exclusively in human microglia. The further identification of human-specific microglia expression profiles and resulting biological properties under physiological and pathological conditions may be implicative for future therapeutic approaches.

However, all comparative studies may be influenced by the challenging isolation of homeostatic human microglia that are commonly derived from post-mortem brains or disease-associated surgical biopsies. Under these conditions, senescence or pathologyassociated cues may influence the transcriptional and functional setting of the analyzed human microglia, e.g., their transition into activated states impeding the mouse and human-model, comparability. Additionally, as adult human microglia seem to be less proliferative than their mouse homologues [48,49] and the survival of microglia from small biopsies is poor, in vitro analysis is limited to very low cell numbers that are not enough for comparable functional analysis. Importantly, it has to be taken into account that these primary cultures are not necessarily restricted to brain parenchymal-derived microglia, but may be "contaminated" by peripheral myeloid populations, possibly contributing to the above-mentioned heterogeneity.

In order to solve this problem, immortalized human microglial cell lines were es-

However, these lines only partially reflect human microglia properties due to the loss of some antigenic characteristics critically involved in proliferation and homeostasis [53].

Increasing knowledge about the key molecules triggering microglial differentiation, maturation, and homeostatic signaling has enabled the development of hiMGL generated from hiPSC. Since 2016, a plethora of protocols have been established aiming at the in vitro generation of mature microglia-like cells mimicking their primary human counterparts concerning the expression of characteristic signature genes and functionality, including proliferation, migration, motility, integration into neural tissue, inflammatory reactions, and phagocytosis [54-65].

Most of the published differentiation protocols try to mimic the in vivo developmental stages of human microglia by sequentially exposing hiPSCs to cytokines and growth factors,
