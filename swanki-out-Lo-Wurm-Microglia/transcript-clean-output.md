Microglia Development and Maturation and Its Implications for Induction of Microglia-Like Cells from Human iPSCs

Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, playing crucial roles in brain development, maintaining homeostasis, and responding to pathological conditions. These cells originate from yolk sac erythromyeloid progenitors and migrate into the embryonic brain, where they differentiate and mature after birth. This maturation process is driven by various chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors, with Transforming Growth Factor Beta One (TGF-beta 1) being a significant regulator. TGF-beta 1 mediates microglial homeostasis, anti-inflammatory responses, and the expression of key microglial genes. Given the challenges of isolating homeostatic human microglia, recent advancements focus on differentiating human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into microglia-like cells. However, the differentiation protocols vary widely in terms of cytokines, growth factors, and culture conditions, leading to discrepancies in the maturity and functionality of the derived cells.

Section: Introduction to Microglia

Microglia are a specialized subset of myeloid cells that reside within the central nervous system. Recent progress in understanding microglia development has led to various in vitro protocols for generating human microglia-like cells (hiMGLs) from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. While these hiMGLs share some molecular signatures with native human microglia, the differentiation protocols need to reflect the latest insights from in vivo microglia maturation studies. Transforming Growth Factor Beta One (TGF-beta 1) is highlighted as a crucial factor in this maturation process. Properly matured hiMGLs are essential for functional studies and potential microglia replacement therapies in humans.

Section: Mouse Microglia Development and Maturation In Vivo

Section: Mouse Microglia Origin and Development

Unlike other macrophage populations, microglia and central nervous system-associated resident macrophages originate from primitive macrophages during the initial wave of hematopoiesis. These primitive macrophages develop from early erythro-myeloid progenitors in the yolk sac around embryonic day eight and a half, requiring transcription factors PU.1 and Irf8 for their development. Differing from monocyte-derived macrophages, these cells do not need the transcription factor Myb. Initially expressing the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit, they gradually lose this marker while gaining CD45 expression. Around embryonic day nine and a half, these primitive macrophages migrate towards the neural tube, populating the developing brain and spinal cord and eventually giving rise to microglia. This migration is facilitated by Interleukin 34 (IL-34), signaling through the colony-stimulating factor one receptor (Csf1r). Additional factors like Maf, Mef2c, and Sall1 are also critical for proper microglia development.

Section: Mouse Postnatal Microglia Maturation

Following prenatal colonization and proliferation, postnatal microglia maturation involves a specific gene expression pattern that distinguishes them from other macrophages. Genes like Tmem119, Olfml3, P2yr12, and Sall1 are upregulated in the first two postnatal weeks, driven by TGF-beta signaling. Neuron-derived TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 released by NG2-glia are crucial for this process. The importance of TGF-beta 1 is underscored by studies showing that its absence leads to a lack of microglia maturation and an inflammatory phenotype. These findings suggest that TGF-beta signaling is essential for maintaining microglial homeostasis and regulating their reactivity. While the functional significance of many homeostatic microglia markers remains unclear, their expression is believed to be vital for mediating microglia functions under physiological conditions.

Section: Functional Consequences of Impaired Microglial Maturation

Microglia play essential roles in central nervous system development and maintenance, such as synaptic pruning, neuronal circuit formation, and supporting neuron survival and myelination. Impaired microglial maturation can have severe consequences, such as motor deficits and loss of cortical inhibitory interneurons. These effects underscore the need for fully matured microglia-like cells from hiPSCs for accurate functional analyses and potential replacement therapies.

Section: Generation of Human Microglia-Like Cells from hiPSCs

The understanding of microglia development largely comes from rodent studies, with few insights from human embryos. Despite sharing many functions, human and rodent microglia have differences at the regulatory level. For example, TGF-beta-mediated suppression of HLA expression is observed only in mouse models, while certain immune genes are exclusive to human microglia. The isolation of homeostatic human microglia is challenging due to senescence and pathology-associated cues. Immortalized human microglial cell lines and hiPSCs offer solutions, but the differentiation protocols must ensure complete maturation to replicate the full spectrum of in vivo microglia functions.

In summary, understanding the development and maturation of microglia is crucial for generating functional microglia-like cells from hiPSCs. These cells hold potential for future studies and therapies, provided they accurately mimic the properties of native human microglia.

Section: Factors Influencing Microglia Maturation in Mice

Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, undergo a complex maturation process influenced by multiple factors during prenatal and postnatal stages in mice. These stages are critical for the proper development and functionality of microglia, which play essential roles in brain homeostasis, immune defense, and neuroinflammation.

Section: Prenatal Factors

During the prenatal stage, microglia originate from yolk sac progenitors that migrate into the developing brain. This migration is influenced by various signaling molecules and cellular interactions. Key growth factors and cytokines, such as bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), stem cell factor (SCF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), drive the differentiation of these progenitors into microglia precursors. Oxygen levels also play a crucial role, as lower oxygen conditions, similar to those found in the embryonic environment, promote the survival and differentiation of microglial progenitors.

Section: Postnatal Factors

In the postnatal stage, microglia continue to mature and integrate into the neural tissue. This maturation process is influenced by the local brain environment, including interactions with neurons and astrocytes.
Section: Factors Activating Microglia Development

Several factors play a role in the development and maturation of microglia, including the activation of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor. This receptor is essential for microglial development and maintenance. Additionally, transforming growth factor beta significantly regulates microglial homeostasis and function, ensuring these cells maintain their roles in the central nervous system.

Section: Experimental Protocols for Human Microglia-like Cells

Researchers have developed protocols to study microglial development and function in vitro by differentiating human-induced pluripotent stem cells into microglia-like cells, known as hiMGLs. These protocols aim to replicate the in vivo developmental stages of microglia by exposing these stem cells to specific growth factors, cytokines, and environmental conditions.

Section: Differentiation into Microglia Progenitors

The differentiation process starts with the induction of mesodermal differentiation using bone morphogenetic protein 4, a critical molecule in almost all protocols. Additional factors, such as stem cell factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, support mesodermal specification. Wnt signaling is also involved; its initial activation promotes the generation of hemangioblasts, while its inhibition drives differentiation into primitive hematopoietic stem cells. These hematopoietic stem cells are comparable to yolk sac progenitors in human microglia development.

Section: Generation of Myeloid Progenitors

The next step involves generating myeloid progenitors using a mix of cytokines, including Flt3, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 3, interleukin 6, stem cell factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and thrombopoietin. The precise timing and combination of these factors are crucial for successful differentiation into hiMGLs. Reduced oxygen levels during initial hematopoietic differentiation have also been shown to enhance the generation of myeloid progenitors.

Section: Final Differentiation and Maturation

The final differentiation step involves switching the cytokine cocktail to interleukin 34 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 10 to 30 days. These factors are critical for microglial survival and maturation, leading to the expression of markers associated with both immature and mature microglia, such as MERTK, ITGB5, CX3CR1, IBA1, CD11b, and TMEM119. This expression pattern is essential for mimicking the functionality of primary human microglia.

Section: Role of Transforming Growth Factor Beta in Microglia Differentiation

Transforming growth factor beta 1 is a key regulator of microglial development, homeostasis, and survival. It acts through the transforming growth factor beta receptor 1, highly expressed by both rodent microglia cultures and hiMGLs. Withdrawal of transforming growth factor beta from the culture medium significantly reduces the expression of microglial surface receptors and transcription factors, highlighting its importance in maintaining microglial identity and function. Interestingly, the effects of transforming growth factor beta can be mimicked by a small molecule called Inducer of Definitive Endoderm1, which promotes similar signaling pathways and supports cell proliferation and differentiation.

Section: Cell-Cell and Cell-Matrix Interactions

The complex microglial niche in the developing brain involves interactions with neurons and astrocytes, which are crucial for the full maturation of hiMGLs. Co-culture with neurons or exposure to neuron-conditioned medium can shift the transcriptome of hiMGLs towards a fetal microglia-like state and promote homeostatic functions. These interactions lead to a more ramified morphology, enhanced migration abilities, and reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines, indicating mechanisms of neuron-mediated homeostasis.

Section: Conditioned Media

Signaling from transforming growth factor beta appears to influence human-induced pluripotent stem cells, especially in the context of neural tissue development. This factor is continuously secreted by both developing and adult neural tissues. However, further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of how these stem cells interact with neural cells to enhance differentiation and maturation for in vitro applications.

Section: Extracellular Matrix Influence

Studies suggest that the extracellular matrix significantly impacts the differentiation and maturation of induced microglia-like cells. For instance, fibronectin coating results in a more complex, branched morphology of these cells compared to other coatings like poly-D-lysine, collagen I, gelatin, or laminin. This indicates that the extracellular environment can profoundly affect cell morphology. Additionally, treatments with soluble CD200 and the chemokine CX3CL1 showed only minor changes in microglial signature genes, suggesting these factors might influence microglial functions more than their differentiation or maturation.

Section: Summary and Conclusions

Generating human-induced microglia-like cells from human-induced pluripotent stem cells replicates the well-documented processes of microglia differentiation and maturation observed in mice. Consequently, these cells could serve as a powerful tool for studying the functional aspects of human microglia. However, for such studies to be meaningful, it is crucial that these in vitro-generated cells exhibit the same molecular signatures as their in vivo counterparts. Comparative analyses of human-induced microglia-like cells and mouse-derived microglia-like cells will help us understand the common and divergent maturation pathways.

To better grasp specific developmental and maturation mechanisms, we need to dissect the molecular interactions of known and unknown modulators that guide the specification of microglial phenotypes at various developmental stages and in different brain regions in mice. Translating these findings into differentiation protocols will pave the way for more reliable and robust in vitro generation of microglia. This ensures that these cells share the typical expression signature and functionality with their in vivo counterparts. Such advances are essential for a deeper understanding of the molecular background of human microglia, including their potential contribution to neurodegenerative diseases. This understanding is crucial for future microglia replacement strategies.

Recent findings emphasize the importance of transforming growth factor beta 1 and microglial transforming growth factor beta signaling in human-induced microglia-like cell differentiation protocols.
Section: Analyzing the Role of Transforming Growth Factor Beta in Microglia Maturation

To understand the specific effects of Transforming Growth Factor Beta One (TGF-beta 1) in human microglia and human-induced microglia-like cells (hiMGLs), it is crucial to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. This involves detailed studies to analyze and validate the potential benefits of TGF-beta 1 as a maturation factor. Ensuring that hiMGLs retain essential features of human microglia in vivo is a key objective. This includes characteristics such as gene expression profiles, functional responses, and interactions within the neural environment.

Section: Implications for Future Research and Therapeutic Applications

The research on TGF-beta 1's role in microglia maturation has significant implications for future studies and therapeutic applications. By understanding how TGF-beta 1 influences the differentiation and maturation process, scientists can refine protocols for generating hiMGLs. These refined hiMGLs can then be used in various applications, from studying neurodegenerative diseases to developing microglia replacement therapies. The ability to create hiMGLs that closely mimic in vivo human microglia ensures more accurate and reliable results in experimental settings.

Section: Concluding Remarks on Microglia Research

Detailed analyses and validation studies are necessary to fully harness its potential in generating mature and functional hiMGLs. By aligning in vitro differentiation protocols with the latest insights from in vivo studies, researchers can create more accurate models for studying microglial behavior and developing therapeutic strategies for neurological conditions.

These sections provide a comprehensive understanding of the importance of TGF-beta 1 in microglia maturation and its potential applications in research and therapy.
