ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image appears to be a graph showing the probability density with respect to radius \( r \) of a Gaussian distribution for various values of the dimensionality \( D \). The graph plots the function \( p(r) \) along the y-axis, representing the probability density, and the radius \( r \) along the x-axis. It shows three curves, each corresponding to a Gaussian distribution in different dimensional spaces: \( D = 1 \) (likely the green curve), \( D = 2 \) (likely the red curve), and \( D = 20 \) (likely the blue curve).

The plot illustrates that as the dimensionality \( D \) increases, the peak of the Gaussian distribution shifts to the right, and the distribution becomes increasingly concentrated within a thin shell at a specific radius. This visualization helps to understand the behavior of probability distributions in high-dimensional spaces and their significance in the context of machine learning and other areas where high-dimensional data is commonly encountered. 

The notion captured here is in line with the text's description that in high-dimensional spaces, most of the volume or probability mass is concentrated in a thin shell away from the center of the distribution, which is a counterintuitive property arising from the 'curse of dimensionality.'
