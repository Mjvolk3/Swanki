ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts a schematic diagram of a two-layer neural network. In this diagram:

- The circles on the left represent input nodes, labeled from \( x_0 \) to \( x_D \), where \( x_0 \) can be considered the bias input since it's often set to a value of 1.
- The circles in the middle represent hidden units or nodes, labeled from \( z_1 \) to \( z_M \), with \( z_0 \) being the bias unit for the hidden layer.
- The circles on the right represent output nodes, labeled from \( y_1 \) to \( y_K \).
- The arrows between the circles represent the weighted connections (synapses) between the nodes of different layers. Each connection has an associated weight \( w \), which is indicated on the diagram by \( w^{(1)} \) for the weights between the input and hidden layers, and \( w^{(2)} \) for the weights between the hidden and output layers.
- The superscript on the weights indicates the layer number, with (1) denoting the first layer (from input to hidden), and (2) denoting the second layer (from hidden to output).
- The weights \( w^{(1)}_{10} \) and \( w^{(2)}_{10} \) likely represent the weight of the bias terms for the connections from the bias units \( x_0 \) and \( z_0 \) to the first non-bias hidden unit and output unit, respectively.

The diagram visually summarizes the structure of a feedforward neural network, where information flows from left to right, starting from inputs through hidden units and eventually to outputs. Each input is linearly combined via weights to influence the hidden layer, which after going through a nonlinear activation function influences the output layer after another linear combination. This is a high-level representation of the computational operations within a neural network.
