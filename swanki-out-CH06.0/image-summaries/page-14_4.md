ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image appears to be a graph plotting a piecewise linear function known as the "hard tanh." This function is generally used as an activation function in neural networks and is defined such that it outputs -1 for inputs less than -1, outputs +1 for inputs greater than 1, and is linear between -1 and 1 (a slope of 1). The graph shows the sharp transitions at the points where the input value is -1 and 1, which is characteristic of the "hard" version of the tanh function. This is in contrast to the smoother, sigmoid-shaped curve of the standard tanh function. The graph is annotated with the label "hard tanh" and includes axes with tick marks, illustrating the behavior of the function across a range of input values from approximately -2.5 to 2.5.
