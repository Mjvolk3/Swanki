ChatGPT figure/image summary: In the image, there is a graph plotting the "softplus" activation function, which is a type of mathematical function used in neural network models. The x-axis represents the input to the activation function "a," and the y-axis represents the output "h(a)". The softplus function equation is given by \(h(a) = \ln(1 + \exp(a))\). This function gradually approaches a linear function for large positive input values, without becoming constant, which helps to alleviate the problem of vanishing gradients often encountered with traditional sigmoidal activation functions. The graph shows a smooth curve starting from the bottom left, gradually increasing and becoming more linear as the input value increases towards the right side.
