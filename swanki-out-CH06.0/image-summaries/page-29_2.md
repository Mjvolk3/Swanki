ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image presented is a schematic diagram of a two-link robot arm demonstrating the inverse kinematics problem referenced in the provided paper. It depicts two possible configurations for the robot arm, which can result in the same end effector position (denoted as a point with Cartesian coordinates (x1, x2)). 

The two configurations are differentiated by the position of the 'elbow' of the robot arm:

1. "Elbow up": The elbow joint of the robot arm is oriented above the line connecting the base to the end effector.
2. "Elbow down": The elbow joint is oriented below that line.

The diagram is labeled to clarify the two distinct states of the elbow joint. The upper configuration shows the robot arm with a straightened look and the elbow pointing upwards, while the lower dotted configuration shows the arm folded with the elbow pointing downwards. Both configurations are connected to a base represented by the gray horizontal line at the bottom of the image.
