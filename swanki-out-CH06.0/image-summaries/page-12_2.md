ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image you've provided appears to be an illustration from a paper or a book related to neural networks and machine learning. The image seems to show a graph derived from a neural network model. Specifically, it looks like one of the plots from Figure 6.10 referenced in the text, where different functions are approximated by a two-layer neural network with three hidden units.

Based on the context, assume this image corresponds to one of the cases discussed in the excerpt, which refers to a two-layer neural network approximating four different functions:

- \( f(x) = x^2 \)
- \( f(x) = \sin(x) \)
- \( f(x) = |x| \)
- \( f(x) = H(x) \) (where \( H(x) \) is the Heaviside step function)

The blue dots in the plot likely represent sampled data points used for training the neural network. The red curve represents the network's output function after training, while the dashed curves seem to show the output from individual hidden units. The neural network used here includes three hidden units with tanh activation functions and linear output units. 

Since it's not explicitly labeled, the exact function being approximated by this particular plot cannot be determined without additional context or labeling within the image itself. However, if this graph depicts one of the cases mentioned in your description, it could be representing how the neural network with tanh activation functions is being used to approximate one of the given functions, with training data (blue dots) and hidden unit activations (dashed lines) showing the intermediate steps in the network's approximation process.
