ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image shows a plot of the contours of the corresponding conditional probability density of the target data for a mixture density network. The colors likely represent different levels of probability density, with denser areas depicted in warmer colors (like red or yellow), and less dense areas in cooler colors (like blue). The axes are scaled from 0 to 1, suggesting a normalized range for the data. This plot corresponds to part (c) of Figure 6.19 from the context provided, illustrating how the conditional density can be trimodal for some values of the input variable x, as indicated by the multiple peaks in the contour plot.
