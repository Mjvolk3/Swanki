ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image displays six graphs, each representing a different nonlinear activation function used in neural networks:

(a) tanh (hyperbolic tangent): A sigmoid-shaped function that outputs values between -1 and 1.
(b) hard tanh: A thresholded version of tanh that gives -1 for inputs less than -1 and 1 for inputs greater than 1, with a linear relationship between -1 and 1.
(c) softplus: A smooth approximation to the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) with a gradual curve, approaching the line y = x for large positive inputs.
(d) ReLU: A function that outputs the input directly for positive inputs and zero for negative inputs.
(e) leaky ReLU: Similar to ReLU but allows a small, non-zero output for negative inputs, defined by a slope parameter α.
(f) absolute: A function that outputs the absolute value of the input, creating a V-shaped graph.

Each graph plots the function’s output as a function of input values, demonstrating their different behaviors for activation in artificial neurons.
