ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided tells us that it is Figure 6.19(d) from the paper, which depicts a plot related to a mixture density network. This plot appears to show the approximate conditional mode of the conditional density. The red points likely represent the mean of the most probable component (with the largest mixing coefficient) at each value of \( \mathbf{x} \). The green circles are probably the data points from the toy example mentioned in the text.

Based on the contextual information, we can say that this plot serves to visualize how a trained mixture density network can predict and represent complex conditional density functions that are multimodal, as opposed to traditional networks which might only predict conditional means. The plot is thus a graphical representation of the neural network's output in response to varying inputs.
