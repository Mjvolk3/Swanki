ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a graph with three curves, each plotted against the same pair of axes. The x-axis is not labeled, but the range appears to go from 0 to 1, and the y-axis runs from 0 to what could be assumed to be 1, based on the scale of the graph. The three curves each have distinct colors - one is blue, one is green, and one is red. Their exact mathematical descriptions are not provided, but they seem to represent functions of x, with each curve peaking at different points along the x-axis. The shape of the curves suggests these could be the plots of mixing coefficients Ï€k(x) from the context given, with each curve representing a different mixture component from a mixture density network. This particular visualization supports the narrative given in the contextual information provided, where the curves likely correspond to Figure 6.19 (a), which describes the variation of these coefficients as a function of the input variable x.
