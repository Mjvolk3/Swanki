ChatGPT figure/image summary: In the image, there are three smaller images at the bottom which appear to be illustrations for contrastive learning paradigms. These smaller images depict a ginger cat (on the left), a close-up of a similar-looking ginger cat's face (in the middle), and a bicycle leaning against a brick wall (on the right).

Above these images, there's a large depiction of a unit hypersphere and three connecting lines from the smaller images forming a triangle, pointing to three separate dots within the hypersphere. The line from the leftmost image (ginger cat) leads to a point on the hypersphere labeled \( f_w(\mathbf{x}) \), indicating the mapping of this image into the representation space. The line from the middle image (close-up of the cat's face) points to a point labeled \( f_w(\mathbf{x}^+) \), suggesting this is an augmented version of the original ginger cat image that forms a 'positive pair' with \( f_w(\mathbf{x}) \) in the representation space. The line from the image on the right (bicycle) leads to a point labeled \( f_w(\mathbf{x}^-) \), indicating that this image forms a 'negative pair' with the original cat image within the context of instance discrimination.

The red arrow between the points \( f_w(\mathbf{x}) \) and \( f_w(\mathbf{x}^-) \) visualizes the learning procedure pushing the representations of a negative pair apart, whereas the green arrow between \( f_w(\mathbf{x}) \) and \( f_w(\mathbf{x}^+) \) shows the representations of a positive pair being pulled closer together. This concept is an aspect of the contrastive learning approach for learning representations in which semantically similar images (positive pairs) are encouraged to have closer representations, and semantically different images (negative pairs) have representations that are further apart.
