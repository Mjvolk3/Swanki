ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows the approximation of a quadratic function using a two-layer neural network. The network is used to model the function \( f(x) = x^2 \). Blue dots represent 50 data points sampled uniformly over the interval \([-1, 1]\). The red curve indicates the output of the trained neural network, which approximates the parabolic shape of the quadratic function. Additionally, there are three dashed curves, each in a different color, which represent the outputs from the three hidden units with tanh activation functions within the neural network. These curves illustrate how each hidden unit contributes to the overall approximation of the quadratic function by the network.
