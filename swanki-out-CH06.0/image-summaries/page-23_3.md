ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts a conceptual illustration of the CLIP model discussed in the provided text excerpt, showing a positive pair made up of an image and its corresponding text caption, which are mapped to a representation space thought of as a unit hypersphere. The image shows a photo of a ginger cat sitting. Associated with this image is a matching text caption "a ginger cat sat on a wall," which forms the positive pair with the image. Additionally, there is an example of a negative text caption, "a bike leaning on a brick wall," which is not related to the image of the cat. The diagram visualizes how the CLIP model brings together the representations of the image and its correct caption, while pushing away the representation of the negative, unrelated caption. The mappings are indicated by \( f_w(x^+) \) for the image and \( g_\theta(y^+) \) for the related text caption.
