ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image displays a graph of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which is a piecewise linear function that outputs zero for any negative input and outputs the input itself for any positive input. The graph shows the function over a range of values, demonstrating that the ReLU activation function is zero when the input is less than zero (the x-axis) and linear with a slope of 1 when the input is positive. The ReLU is widely used in the field of neural networks due to its computational efficiency and its ability to alleviate the vanishing gradients problem during training.
