ChatGPT figure/image summary: This image appears to be a scatter plot with two types of points, shown as blue circles and red crosses, representing a synthetic data set for a two-class classification problem. The dashed blue lines correspond to the \( z=0.5 \) contours for each of the two hidden units in the neural network, which presumably have tanh activation functions. The solid red line indicates the \( y=0.5 \) decision surface of the neural network, which is the boundary used by the network to differentiate between the two classes. Additionally, there is a solid green line that represents the optimal decision boundary computed from the distributions used to generate the data points. This demonstrates how a neural network with a given architecture performs in terms of separating the classes based on the learned decision boundary compared to the ideal one.
