ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a schematic representation of a two-link robot arm as used in the explanation of forward kinematics. The robot arm is composed of two segments (links) labeled L1 and L2, which can pivot at their joints. The joint angles that determine the position of the end effector (the tip of the arm) are denoted by theta1 (θ1) and theta2 (θ2), corresponding to the first and second joints respectively. The Cartesian coordinates of the end effector are labeled as (x1, x2), represented in the image by a blue dot. This illustrates the unique relationship between the joint angles and the end effector's position in the case of forward kinematics problems.
