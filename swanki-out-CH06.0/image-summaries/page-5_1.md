ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image provided is a plot illustrating the volume fraction of a hypersphere of radius \( r=1 \) that lies in the range of \( r=1-\epsilon \) to \( r=1 \) for various values of the dimensionality \( D \). The plot shows curves for different dimensionalities (D = 1, D = 2, D = 5, D = 20) as functions of \( \epsilon \). Each curve represents the fraction of the hypersphere's volume near the surface as the dimensionality increases. The x-axis represents \( \epsilon \), which ranges from 0 to 1, whereas the y-axis represents the volume fraction, ranging from 0 to 1. As can be seen in the plot, for higher dimensions (like when D = 20), even a small \( \epsilon \) results in a large volume fraction near the hypersphere's surface, illustrating the concept known as the "curse of dimensionality".
