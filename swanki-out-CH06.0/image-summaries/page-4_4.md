ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a three-dimensional representation of a regular grid, which divides the space into smaller cubic regions. The red outlines represent the cubes, and within these, the dotted lines represent the grid structure that creates the smaller regions or cells. The axes \( x_1 \), \( x_2 \), and \( x_3 \) are labeled, indicating the three dimensions of the space. This illustration serves as a visual aid for understanding the concept of dividing a region of space into cells, which is a topic of discussion related to high-dimensional spaces in the context of the provided text. This visual relates to the "curse of dimensionality," showing that as the dimensionality \( D \) increases, the number of cells grows exponentially, leading to the challenges in data classification and model complexity that were discussed.
