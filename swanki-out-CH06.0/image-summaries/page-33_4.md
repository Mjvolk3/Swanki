ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image is a plot of three curves within a two-dimensional coordinate system. It is a graphical representation with the x-axis ranging from approximately zero to one and the y-axis also ranging from zero to one.

The plot features three curves, each depicted in a different color:

- The red curve, which starts high near the y-axis and decreases as x increases, leveling off as it approaches x=1.
- The green curve shows a peak in the middle, starting and ending at lower values on the y-axis.
- The blue curve starts at zero near the y-axis and increases as x approaches one.

Given the context from the paper and mathematical notations, these are likely the plots of mixing coefficients (Ï€k(x)) as a function of x for three mixture components within a mixture density network. Each mixture component curve represents the strength or weight of that component at each value of x, which are used in a machine learning model to predict complex probability distributions over the targets conditioned on the inputs. 

The different amplitudes of these plots indicate how different mixture components contribute to the overall mixture model at different input values (x).
