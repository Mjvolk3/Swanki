ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image you provided is a simple one-dimensional (1D) representation of a space divided into regular segments, or cells, with red marks indicating the boundaries between the cells. This is denoted by "$D=1$" indicating that it illustrates a single dimension, labeled with $x_1$ as the axis. These kinds of illustrations are often used in the context of discussing concepts such as partitioning space for various computational algorithms, and more specifically, as mentioned in the text you provided, to show how the number of regions (cells) grows as the dimensionality $D$ increases. This image is used to depict the simplest case, where the space is one-dimensional and therefore the number of segments corresponds directly to the number of cells or partitions along the axis.
