What is the purpose of a mixture density network as illustrated in the image?

%

A mixture density network is designed for predicting a probability distribution of an output variable \( t \) as a function of an input variable \( x \). It represents a general formalism for modeling arbitrary conditional density functions \( p(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}) \) by using a parametric mixture model whose parameters are determined by a neural network that takes \( \mathbf{x} \) as its input vector.

## Conditional Probability Density Function: Mixture Density Network

What is the formula for the conditional probability density function \( p(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}) \) in a mixture density network with Gaussian components, and what does it represent?

%

The formula for the conditional probability density function \( p(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}) \) in a mixture density network with Gaussian components is:

$$
p(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_{k}(\mathbf{x}) \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{t} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}(\mathbf{x}), \sigma_{k}^{2}(\mathbf{x})\right)
$$

This represents a heteroscedastic model where the noise variance on the data is a function of the input vector \( \mathbf{x} \). Here, \( \pi_{k}(\mathbf{x}) \) are the mixing coefficients, \( \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}(\mathbf{x}) \) are the means of the Gaussian components, and \( \sigma_{k}^{2}(\mathbf{x}) \) are their variances.
