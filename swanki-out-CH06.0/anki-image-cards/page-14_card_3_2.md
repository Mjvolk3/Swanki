Explain the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function and its significance in neural networks.

%

The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is a piecewise linear function defined as:

$$
f(a) = 
\begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } a < 0 \\
a & \text{if } a \geq 0 
\end{cases}
$$

The significance of ReLU in neural networks includes:
- Computational efficiency: Simple function which speeds up the training process.
- Alleviates vanishing gradients problem: Helps to maintain the gradient flow, thus improving learning in deep networks.

Compare the functions of ReLU and tanh, and describe a scenario when you might prefer one over the other.

%

- The ReLU function is defined as:
  
  $$
  f(a) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  0 & \text{if } a < 0 \\
  a & \text{if } a \geq 0 
  \end{cases}
  $$

- The tanh function is defined as:

  $$
  \tanh(a) = \frac{e^a - e^{-a}}{e^a + e^{-a}}
  $$

- Comparison:
  - ReLU: Outputs zero for negative inputs and the input itself for positive inputs. Very efficient and alleviates vanishing gradients but can suffer from dying ReLUs.
  - tanh: Outputs values in the range \([-1, 1]\). Lessens the chance of neuron "dying" but can be computationally more intensive and suffer from vanishing gradients.

- Scenario preference:
  - ReLU: Deep neural networks, where computational efficiency and alleviation of the vanishing gradient problem are paramount.
  - tanh: Shallower networks, where more nuanced gradients might be necessary and the risk of neuron "death" is higher.
