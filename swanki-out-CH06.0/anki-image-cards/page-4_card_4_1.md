The number of regions in a regular grid scales exponentially with the dimensionality \( D \) of the space. Specifically, if each dimension is divided into \( N \) intervals, the total number of regions would be \( N^D \).

The figure illustrates how the number of regions in a regular grid grows exponentially with the dimensionality \( D \) of the space. For \( D = 3 \), a subset of cubical regions formed by the grid is shown, highlighting the increasing complexity and number of regions as dimensions are added.
