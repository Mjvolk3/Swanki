What do the different subfigures (a)-(d) in the image represent in the context of a mixture density network?

%

- Subfigure (a) shows a plot of the mixing coefficients $\pi_{k}(x)$ for three mixture components as functions of $x$.
- Subfigure (b) depicts plots of the means $\mu_{k}(x)$ corresponding to these Gaussian components, colour-coded to match the mixing coefficients from (a).
- Subfigure (c) is a contour plot of the conditional probability density of the target data for the mixture density network.
- Subfigure (d) displays the approximate conditional mode (in red) of the conditional density, with green dots representing individual observations.

What does the equation 

$$
s^{2}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_{k}(\mathbf{x}) \left\{ \sigma_{k}^{2}(\mathbf{x}) + \left\| \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}(\mathbf{x}) - \sum_{l=1}^{K} \pi_{l}(\mathbf{x}) \boldsymbol{\mu}_{l}(\mathbf{x}) \right\|^{2} \right\}
$$ 

represent in the context of a mixture density network?

%

This equation represents the variance of the conditional probability density function about the conditional mean, $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}]$. It decomposes the variance into two components: the weighted sum of the variances of the individual Gaussian components $\sigma_{k}^{2}(\mathbf{x})$, and the weighted sum of the squared deviations of the means $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}(\mathbf{x})$ from the overall conditional mean.
