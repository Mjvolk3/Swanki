The top row shows examples of natural images of size $64 \times 64$ pixels, which contain recognizable subjects. The bottom row shows images of the same size but created by randomly generating pixel values from a uniform distribution. The natural images demonstrate structured patterns, whereas the randomly generated images appear as noisy, multicolored pixels. This comparison highlights that real-world images occupy a small, structured portion of the high-dimensional space of all possible images.
