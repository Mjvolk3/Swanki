What is the instance discrimination approach in contrastive learning?

%

The instance discrimination approach in contrastive learning involves creating positive pairs by augmenting the same image and mapping them to a normalized space, such as a unit hypersphere. The loss function encourages the representations of positive pairs to be closer together while pushing negative pairs further apart.

Explain the image components and their contribution to the contrastive learning process depicted in the figure.

The image contains several components:
- A shaded unit hypersphere representing a high-dimensional space where image representations are projected.
- Three arrows pointing to different representations on the sphere:
  - Red arrow: $f_w(X^-)$ (negative pair instance).
  - Green arrow: $f_w(X)$ (original image representation).
  - Black arrow: $f_w(X^+)$ (positive pair instance, augmented version of the original image).
- Below the sphere, three images are displayed:
  1. $X$: Original image of a cat.
  2. $X^+$: Augmented image of the same cat.
  3. $X^-$: Unrelated image of a bicycle.

The goal is to minimize the distance between the representations of positive pairs and maximize the distance between negative pairs in the high-dimensional space.
