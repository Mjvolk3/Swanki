The objective of the instance discrimination approach is to bring the representations of positive pairs (the anchor and its augmented version) closer together while pushing negative pairs further apart. This is achieved by mapping these representations to a normalized space, such as a unit hypersphere.

## How are positive and negative pairs represented in the instance discrimination paradigm in contrastive learning?

In the instance discrimination paradigm:

- Positive pairs consist of an anchor image $\mathbf{x}$ and its augmented version $\mathbf{x}^+$.
- Negative pairs are other instances such as $\mathbf{y}^+$.
- These are represented in a normalized space like a unit hypersphere, with the goal of making positive pairs closer and negative pairs more distant.
