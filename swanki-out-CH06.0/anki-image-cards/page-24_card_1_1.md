The diagram represents a neural network with a general feed-forward topology. It illustrates a network structure comprising two input units ($x_1$ and $x_2$), three hidden units ($z_1$, $z_2$, and $z_3$), and two output units ($y_1$ and $y_2$), showing the connections between these units. Each hidden and output unit has an associated bias parameter, though omitted for clarity.

## What components in the neural network diagram are not explicitly shown but are important?

The bias parameters associated with each hidden and output unit in the neural network are not explicitly shown in the diagram but are essential for the computations. These bias terms are a crucial part of the activation functions used in the network.
