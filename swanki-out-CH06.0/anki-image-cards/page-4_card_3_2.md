### Card 1

**How does the number of regions in a regular grid grow as the dimensionality \( D \) of the space increases?**

The number of regions in a regular grid grows exponentially with the dimensionality \( D \) of the space. For example, the number of regions for a space with dimension \( D = 1 \) increases linearly, but for \( D = 2 \), it grows as \( 2^2 = 4 \), and for \( D = 3 \), it grows as \( 2^3 = 8 \). This exponential growth is a key aspect of the "curse of dimensionality."

The "curse of dimensionality" refers to the exponential increase in the number of regions when dividing a space into regular cells as the dimensionality \( D \) increases. The provided image shows this concept with grids for \( D = 1 \), \( D = 2 \), and \( D = 3 \). For clarity, only a subset of the regions are shown for \( D = 3 \), but it illustrates that the number of cells grows exponentially with each added dimension.
