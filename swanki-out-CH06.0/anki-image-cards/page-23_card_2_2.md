What does the red arrow between \( f_w(\mathbf{x}) \) and \( f_w(\mathbf{x}^-) \) signify in the instance discrimination approach of contrastive learning?

%

In the instance discrimination approach of contrastive learning, the red arrow between \( f_w(\mathbf{x}) \) and \( f_w(\mathbf{x}^-) \) signifies the learning procedure pushing the representations of a negative pair apart. This helps the model distinguish between semantically different images by increasing the distance between their representations in the representation space.

What is the purpose of the green arrow between \( f_w(\mathbf{x}) \) and \( f_w(\mathbf{x}^+) \) in the context of contrastive learning?

%

The green arrow between \( f_w(\mathbf{x}) \) and \( f_w(\mathbf{x}^+) \) in contrastive learning illustrates the process of pulling the representations of a positive pair closer together. This is done to ensure that semantically similar images (positive pairs) have closer representations in the representation space, thereby enhancing the model's ability to recognize and group similar images.
