The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function is defined as:
$$
\tanh(a) = \frac{e^{a} - e^{-a}}{e^{a} + e^{-a}}
$$

The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function exhibits an S-shaped curve. It asymptotically approaches 1 for large positive inputs and -1 for large negative inputs, with a transition around the origin (0,0). The function is zero-centered and ranges between -1 and 1.
