What is illustrated in the instance discrimination approach for contrastive learning according to Figure 6.14?

%

In Figure 6.14 (a), the instance discrimination approach is illustrated, where the positive pair consists of an anchor and an augmented version of the same image. These are mapped to points in a normalized space, conceptualized as a unit hypersphere. The loss function encourages the representations of the positive pair to be closer together while pushing the negative pairs further apart.

What role do the colored arrows play in Figure 6.14â€™s instance discrimination illustration?

%

In Figure 6.14's instance discrimination illustration, the colored arrows indicate that the loss function's objective is to bring the representations of the positive pair (the anchor and its augmented version) closer together while pushing the negative pairs further apart in the normalized space.
