The image depicts the process of transfer learning. In transfer learning, a neural network is initially trained on a task with abundant data, such as object classification of natural images. The early layers of the network, represented in red, are then copied, while the final layers, shown in blue, are retrained on a new, related task with a limited data set, such as skin lesion classification. This approach helps the network leverage the knowledge gained from the first task to improve performance on the second task with fewer data.

## How does transfer learning mitigate overfitting in tasks with scarce data?

Transfer learning mitigates overfitting in tasks with scarce data by copying the early layers of a pre-trained network (trained on a task with abundant data, e.g., object classification of natural images) and retraining only the final few layers (on a new task with limited data, e.g., skin lesion classification). By retaining the knowledge from the initial training, the model can generalize better and avoid overfitting to the small dataset associated with the new task.
