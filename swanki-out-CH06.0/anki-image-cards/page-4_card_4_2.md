The number of regions in a regular grid grows exponentially with the dimensionality $D$ of the space.

## What is illustrated by the image shown in Figure 6.3, and how does it relate to the curse of dimensionality?

Figure 6.3 illustrates the curse of dimensionality by showing a three-dimensional (3D) representation of a regular grid. This grid divides the space into smaller cubic regions. The red outlines and the dotted lines represent the grid structure creating these smaller regions or cells. This serves as a visual aid to understand how the number of cells in a region grows exponentially as the dimensionality $D$ increases, which poses challenges in data classification and model complexity.
