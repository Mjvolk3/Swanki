In the image, $N=50$ data points (blue dots) are sampled uniformly in $x$ over the interval $(-1,1)$, and $f(x)$ values are evaluated. These data points train a two-layer neural network with three hidden units using tanh activation functions and linear output units. The red curves represent the resulting network functions, while the dashed curves show the outputs of the three hidden units.

## What was proven about the approximation properties of two-layer feed-forward networks in the 1980s and what term is used to describe them?

In the 1980s, it was proven that two-layer feed-forward networks with various activation functions can approximate any function defined over a continuous subset of $\mathbb{R}^{D}$ to arbitrary accuracy. This result is also valid for functions mapping between any finite-dimensional discrete spaces. Because of this property, neural networks are referred to as universal approximators.
