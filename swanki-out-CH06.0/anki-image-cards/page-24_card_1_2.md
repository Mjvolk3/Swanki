Describe the general structure of the neural network shown in the diagram.

%

The diagram represents a neural network with a feed-forward topology. It includes:

- **Two input units**: \(x_1\) and \(x_2\)
- **Three hidden units**: \(z_1\), \(z_2\), and \(z_3\)
- **Two output units**: \(y_1\) and \(y_2\)

Each hidden and output unit would compute its activation as a function of its weighted inputs and a bias term.

What is the purpose of the bias parameters in hidden and output units of a neural network?

%

Bias parameters in hidden and output units of a neural network allow the model to fit the data better. They provide each neuron with an additional degree of freedom and enable the activation threshold to shift, thus aiding in the network's ability to learn patterns and functions more effectively.
