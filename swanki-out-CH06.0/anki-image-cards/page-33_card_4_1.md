Describe the plots of the means $\mu_{k}(x)$ and their significance in a mixture density network.

%

In a mixture density network, the plots of the means $\mu_{k}(x)$ show the expected value of each mixture component as a function of the input $x$. Each curve represents how the mean of each component changes with $x$, providing insight into how different parts of the input space are modeled by each mixture component. The color coding corresponds to different mixture components, allowing one to visually assess the contribution of each component:

- The red curve typically signifies one mixture component's performance with higher values near the y-axis.
- The green curve usually indicates another component that peaks in the middle range of $x$.
- The blue curve shows another component starting low and increasing with $x$.

These plots help in understanding the behavior of the mixture components across different input values, crucial for predicting complex conditional probability distributions.

Discuss how the variance of the density function about the conditional average is computed in a mixture density network.

%

The variance of the density function about the conditional average in a mixture density network is given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
s^{2}(\mathbf{x}) & =\mathbb{E}\left[\|\mathbf{t}-\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}]\|^{2} \mid \mathbf{x}\right] \\
& =\sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_{k}(\mathbf{x})\left\{\sigma_{k}^{2}(\mathbf{x})+\left\|\boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}(\mathbf{x})-\sum_{l=1}^{K} \pi_{l}(\mathbf{x}) \boldsymbol{\mu}_{l}(\mathbf{x})\right\|^{2}\right\}
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $ \pi_{k}(\mathbf{x}) $ are the mixing coefficients, $ \sigma_{k}^{2}(\mathbf{x}) $ represent the variances of each mixture component, and $ \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}(\mathbf{x}) $ are the mean values of the mixture components. The first term inside the sum corresponds to the variance within each component, while the second term accounts for the deviation of each component's mean from the overall conditional mean.

These computations enable us to quantify the uncertainty in the model's predictions, considering both the individual spread of each component and their deviation from the overall mean.
