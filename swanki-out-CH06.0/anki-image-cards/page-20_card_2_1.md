What does the schematic illustration in Figure 6.13 represent in the context of machine learning?

%

The schematic illustration in Figure 6.13 represents transfer learning, where a neural network is first trained on a task with abundant data (e.g., object classification of natural images). The early layers of the network are copied and the final layers are retrained on a new, related task with scarcer data (e.g., skin lesion classification). The early layers capture general features, while the final layers are fine-tuned for the specific task.

Describe how the layers of the neural network are utilized differently in the context of transfer learning as shown in Figure 6.13.

%

In the context of transfer learning as shown in Figure 6.13, the early layers of the neural network, colored in red, are copied from a network pre-trained on a task with abundant data, like object classification of natural images. These layers capture general features applicable across different tasks. The final layers, colored in blue, are retrained for a specific task such as skin lesion classification, fine-tuning the network to recognize specific patterns required for the new task.
