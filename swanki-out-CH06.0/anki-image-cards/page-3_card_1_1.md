    The curse of dimensionality in polynomial regression is illustrated by the rapid increase in the number of independent coefficients as the number of dimensions $D$ increases. Specifically, for a polynomial of order $M$, the growth in the number of coefficients is $\mathcal{O}(D^M)$, making the model unwieldy as $D$ increases. This phenomenon highlights significant challenges in high-dimensional spaces, rendering polynomial regression of little practical utility in such scenarios.

    The key goal of the plot is to classify a new test point (denoted by $x$) based on its proximity to clusters of data points corresponding to three species of iris flowers. The plot consists of:
    - Red, green, and blue points indicating three species of iris flowers.
    - Axes representing measurements of sepal length and sepal width.
    - A new test point, $x$, to be classified.
