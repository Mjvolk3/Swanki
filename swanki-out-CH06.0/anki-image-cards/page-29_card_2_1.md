What are the two possible configurations of the joint angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ for a two-link robot arm to achieve a specific end effector position?

%

For a two-link robot arm, the two possible configurations of the joint angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ to achieve a specific end effector position $(x_1, x_2)$, given the fixed lengths $L_1$ and $L_2$ of the arms, are referred to as:

1. Elbow up: The elbow joint is oriented above the line connecting the base to the end effector.
2. Elbow down: The elbow joint is oriented below that line.

What is forward kinematics in the context of a two-link robot arm?

%

In the context of a two-link robot arm, forward kinematics is the process of determining the Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, x_2)$ of the end effector uniquely based on the joint angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ and the fixed lengths $L_1$ and $L_2$ of the arms.
