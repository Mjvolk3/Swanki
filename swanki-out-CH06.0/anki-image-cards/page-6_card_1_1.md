How does the probability density of a Gaussian distribution change in high-dimensional spaces?

As the dimensionality \( D \) increases, the peak of the Gaussian distribution shifts to the right, and the distribution becomes increasingly concentrated within a thin shell at a specific radius. This phenomenon signifies that most of the probability mass of a Gaussian in high-dimensional space is located within this thin shell away from the center.

## Card 2

What is the implication of high-dimensional Gaussian distributions in machine learning?

In machine learning, the concentration of a Gaussian distribution's probability mass within a thin shell in high-dimensional spaces implies that data points are typically found within this thin shell rather than near the center. This counterintuitive property, arising from the 'curse of dimensionality,' impacts how algorithms perform and process high-dimensional data.
