The growth in the number of independent coefficients for polynomial regression as the dimensionality $D$ increases is $\mathcal{O}\left(D^{3}\right)$. For a polynomial of order $M$, this growth is $\mathcal{O}\left(D^{M}\right)$. This rapid increase in the number of coefficients in high-dimensional spaces is a manifestation of the curse of dimensionality.

### Card 2

What challenge is highlighted by the curse of dimensionality in polynomial regression?

The curse of dimensionality highlights the severe difficulties faced in high-dimensional spaces during polynomial regression. Specifically, as dimensionality increases, the growth in the number of independent coefficients needed becomes unwieldy, making polynomials of many dimensions of little practical utility.
