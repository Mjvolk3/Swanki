**A:**
The top row shows natural images of size $64 \times 64$ pixels, displaying recognizable subjects such as a blurry image, a bicycle, and a cat. These are structured and represent real-world scenes. The bottom row shows images of the same size, created by randomly generating pixel values from a uniform distribution, resulting in non-representational, noisy collections of multicolored pixels, demonstrating the contrast between the structured nature of natural images and the unstructured random noise.

### Card 2

**Q: What do the images in Figure 6.8 demonstrate about the space of possible images?**

%

**A:**
The images in Figure 6.8 illustrate that real-world images occupy a small, structured portion of the high-dimensional space of possible images. Natural images (upper row) are visually coherent and structured, while randomly generated images (bottom row) are unstructured and appear as noisy collections of pixels. This demonstrates that neural networks must learn to navigate this structured subset of the image space.
