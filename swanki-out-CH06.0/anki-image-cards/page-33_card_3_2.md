What does the (b) plot represent in the given image context?

%

The (b) plot represents the means $\mu_{k}(x)$, using the same color coding as for the mixing coefficients, in the context of a mixture density network.

## Understanding the Contour Plot in Mixture Density Networks

What does the (c) plot with contours illustrate about the mixture density network?

%

The (c) plot shows the contours of the corresponding conditional probability density of the target data for the mixture density network. The colors indicate different levels of probability density, with denser areas depicted in warmer colors (e.g., red or yellow) and less dense areas in cooler colors (e.g., blue). This suggests a trimodal conditional density for some values of the input variable $x$.
