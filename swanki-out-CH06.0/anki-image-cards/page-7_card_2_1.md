The image shows examples of a handwritten digit "5" that differ in location and orientation within the images. This variability represents data points on a nonlinear, three-dimensional manifold within a higher-dimensional image space. The manifold's lower dimensionality compared to the data space suggests fewer basis functions are required for effective representation.

## What advantage is expected when associating localized basis functions with the data manifold instead of the entire high-dimensional data space?

Associating localized basis functions with the data manifold, rather than the entire high-dimensional data space, can significantly reduce the number of required basis functions. This is because the dimensionality of the data manifold is typically much lower than that of the full data space. Consequently, the basis functions will grow exponentially with the manifold's dimensionality, providing a more efficient representation.
