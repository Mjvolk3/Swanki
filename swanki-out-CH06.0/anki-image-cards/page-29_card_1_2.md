The Cartesian coordinates \((x_{1}, x_{2})\) of the end effector are determined uniquely by the two joint angles $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$, along with the fixed lengths $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ of the arms. This is known as the forward kinematics of the arm.

## What is the problem of finding the joint angles to achieve a desired end effector position called?

The problem of finding the joint angles $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$ to achieve a desired end effector position \((x_{1}, x_{2})\) is called inverse kinematics. In this situation, there are usually multiple solutions, such as 'elbow up' and 'elbow down'.
