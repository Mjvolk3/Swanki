### What does the plot of the probability density with respect to the radius \( r \) of a Gaussian distribution for various values of the dimensionality \( D \) demonstrate?

The plot demonstrates that as the dimensionality \( D \) increases, the probability density \( p(r) \) of the Gaussian distribution becomes concentrated within a thin shell at a specific radius. More specifically:

- For \( D = 1 \): The distribution is centered around the origin.
- For \( D = 2 \): The distribution starts to shift away from the origin.
- For \( D = 20 \): Most of the probability mass is within a thin shell at a specific radius, away from the center, illustrating the 'curse of dimensionality.'

### How is the probability density \( p(r) \) of a Gaussian distribution in high-dimensional space affected by the transformation from Cartesian to polar coordinates?

When transforming from Cartesian to polar coordinates and integrating out the directional variables, the probability density \( p(r) \) as a function of radius \( r \) from the origin is obtained. This density is plotted for various dimensions \( D \) and shows that in high-dimensional spaces:

- The probability mass is primarily concentrated in a thin shell at a specific radius \( r \).
- For large dimensions \( D \), the probability mass shifts further from the origin, emphasizing the concentration within a thin shell, rather than being centered.

This behavior underscores the implications of the 'curse of dimensionality' in high-dimensional Gaussian distributions.
