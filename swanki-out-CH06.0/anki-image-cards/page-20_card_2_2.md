Explain the concept depicted in this diagram of transfer learning.

%

The diagram illustrates transfer learning in the context of neural networks, specifically for skin lesion classification. The network's early layers (in red) are copied from a model pre-trained on a task with abundant data, such as object classification of natural images. These layers are designed to capture general features applicable to many tasks. The later layers (in blue) are retrained for the specific task of classifying skin lesions, which involves a smaller dataset. Transfer learning leverages knowledge from the first task to improve performance on the latter task, thereby mitigating issues related to overfitting and limited data availability in the new domain.

What are the roles of the red and blue layers in the context of the depicted transfer learning diagram?

%

In the depicted transfer learning diagram, the red layers represent the early layers of the neural network that are copied from a model pre-trained on a different task (object classification of natural images). These layers capture general features that are transferable across multiple tasks. The blue layers denote the latter layers of the network, which are retrained specifically for the new task of classifying skin lesions. The retraining ensures that the network adapts to recognize features specific to the new task using a smaller, task-specific dataset.
