The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function outputs zero for any negative input ($x < 0$) and outputs the input itself for any positive input ($x \geq 0$). This can be mathematically represented as:

$$
\text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)
$$

ReLU is computationally efficient and helps to alleviate the vanishing gradients problem during neural network training.

The hyperbolic tangent function, $\tanh$, is defined as:

$$
\tanh (a)=\frac{e^{a}-e^{-a}}{e^{a}+e^{-a}}
$$

It is a sigmoid-shaped function that ranges between -1 and 1. Compared to the logistic sigmoid function, $\tanh$ is a scaled version that maps the input zero to zero. It is widely used in neural networks because it provides a normalized output that maintains zero-centered activations.
