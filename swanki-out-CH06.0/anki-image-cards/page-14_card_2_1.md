The hyperbolic tangent function, $\tanh(a)$, is defined as:

$$
\tanh (a) = \frac{e^{a} - e^{-a}}{e^{a} + e^{-a}}
$$

## Explain the significance of the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function in neural networks.

The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function is significant in neural networks due to its S-shaped curve, which asymptotically approaches 1 for large positive inputs and -1 for large negative inputs. This makes it zero-centered, potentially leading to better performance during training compared to the logistic sigmoid function, which ranges from 0 to 1. Networks with logistic-sigmoid hidden-unit activation functions can have equivalent networks with tanh activation functions due to the linear transformation relationship between these functions.
