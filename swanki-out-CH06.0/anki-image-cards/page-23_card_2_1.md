What is the main concept behind the instance discrimination approach in contrastive learning, as illustrated in the image?

%

The instance discrimination approach in contrastive learning involves mapping an image (anchor) $\mathbf{x}$ and its augmented version $\mathbf{x}^{+}$ into a representation space (unit hypersphere). The positive pair (anchor and augmentation) is encouraged to have closer representations, while representations of negative pairs (anchors and semantically different images) are pushed further apart. This is visualized by green arrows pulling positive pairs together and red arrows pushing negative pairs apart.
