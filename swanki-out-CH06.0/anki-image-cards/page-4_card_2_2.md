The number of cells in a region grows exponentially with the dimensionality $D$ of the space. This exponential growth causes computational challenges, as it would require an exponentially large quantity of training data to populate the cells.

The illustration for $D=1$ depicts a one-dimensional space divided into regular segments (or cells) with red marks indicating the boundaries. The segments are along the $x_1$ axis, showing the simplest case where the number of cells directly corresponds to the number of partitions along the axis, demonstrating the concept of partitioning space.
