The plot illustrates the fraction of the volume of a hypersphere of radius \( r=1 \) lying in the range \( r=1-\epsilon \) to \( r=1 \) for various values of the dimensionality \( D \). It shows that as the dimensionality \( D \) increases, even a small \( \epsilon \) results in a large volume fraction near the sphere's surface, demonstrating the "curse of dimensionality".

## What is one significant implication of the plot for higher-dimensional spaces?

One significant implication is that in higher-dimensional spaces, a large portion of the volume of a hypersphere is concentrated near its surface. This phenomenon is a major aspect of the "curse of dimensionality," making it challenging to classify data points in high-dimensional spaces since most of the volume lies close to the boundary.
