Explain how the red, green, and blue curves in the plot represent the means $\mu_{k}(x)$ for different mixture components.

%

The red, green, and blue curves in the plot represent the means $\mu_{k}(x)$ for different mixture components in a mixture density network. The red curve indicates a mean value that starts high near the y-axis and decreases as $x$ increases, leveling off as it approaches $x=1$. The green curve shows a peak in the middle, indicating variability in the mean at different $x$ values, starting and ending at lower values on the y-axis. The blue curve starts at zero near the y-axis and increases as $x$ approaches one, showing an upward trend of the mean.

## Conditional Probability Density and Conditional Mode

Describe the conditional probability density and the conditional mode as illustrated by plot (c) and the red points in plot (d).

%

Plot (c) illustrates the contours of the conditional probability density for the target data given the input, representing the probability distribution's shape and concentration. Plot (d) shows the approximate conditional mode with the red points, which indicate the most likely target value for given input values by identifying the peaks of the conditional density. The conditional mode helps highlight the areas of highest probability, complementing the mean values shown in plot (b).
