Forward kinematics is the process of calculating the position of the end effector (given by the Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, x_2)$) of the two-link robot arm based on the joint angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, and the fixed lengths $L_1$ and $L_2$ of the arms.

## What are the two possible solutions for the inverse kinematics of the two-link robot arm as depicted in Figure 6.16 (b)?

The inverse kinematics problem for the two-link robot arm has two possible solutions:
1. "Elbow up": The elbow joint is oriented above the line connecting the base to the end effector.
2. "Elbow down": The elbow joint is oriented below that line.
