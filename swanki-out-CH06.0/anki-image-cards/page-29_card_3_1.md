In the simple forward problem (left plot), the neural network model, shown by the red curve, fits the data points (green circles) well, with small variance around the curve. This indicates that the model has captured the underlying pattern of the data effectively.

In the corresponding inverse problem (right plot), the same neural network model fits poorly to the data. The data points form a multimodal distribution with two distinct clusters. The red curve struggles to capture the complexity and multimodal nature of the data. This demonstrates the model's limitations in handling non-Gaussian, complex distributions in inverse problems.

## Why does the same neural network model perform poorly on the inverse problem compared to the forward problem in the given scatter plots?

The poor performance of the neural network model on the inverse problem (right plot) compared to the forward problem (left plot) is due to the multimodal nature of the data. In the inverse problem, the data points are distributed in two separate clusters, indicating the existence of multiple regimes or solutions. This complexity makes it difficult for the model to fit a single smooth curve that accurately represents the underlying pattern, unlike the forward problem where the data is more straightforward and follows a single pattern.
