In this image, $N=50$ data points, shown as blue dots, have been uniformly sampled in $x$ over the interval $(-1,1)$, and the corresponding values of $f(x)$ were evaluated. A two-layer neural network with three hidden units using tanh activation functions and linear output units was then trained with these data points. The red curve depicts the resulting network function, and the dashed curves represent the outputs of the three hidden units.

## How is the universal approximation theorem related to two-layer feed-forward networks?

The universal approximation theorem states that two-layer feed-forward neural networks with a wide range of activation functions can approximate any function defined over a continuous subset of $\mathbb{R}^{D}$ to arbitrary accuracy. This applies to functions from finite-dimensional discrete spaces to any other space, thus labeling neural networks as universal approximators. Despite this, the theorem assures us only of the existence of such a network but doesn't necessarily specify how to construct it.
