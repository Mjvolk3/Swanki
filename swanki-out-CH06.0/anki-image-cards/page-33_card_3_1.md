What does the contour plot (c) represent in the context of a mixture density network?

% 

The contour plot (c) represents the conditional probability density of the target data for a mixture density network. The colors likely signify different levels of probability density, with dense areas depicted in warmer colors like red or yellow, and less dense areas in cooler colors such as blue. This visualization shows how the conditional density can be multimodal for some values of the input variable $x$, as evidenced by the multiple peaks.

## Conditional Variance Evaluation in Mixture Density Networks

How is the variance of the density function about the conditional average evaluated in a mixture density network?

%

The variance of the density function about the conditional average in a mixture density network is evaluated using the following equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
s^{2}(\mathbf{x}) & =\mathbb{E}\left[\|\mathbf{t}-\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}]\|^{2} \mid \mathbf{x}\right] \\
& =\sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_{k}(\mathbf{x})\left\{\sigma_{k}^{2}(\mathbf{x})+\left\|\boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}(\mathbf{x})-\sum_{l=1}^{K} \pi_{l}(\mathbf{x}) \boldsymbol{\mu}_{l}(\mathbf{x})\right\|^{2}\right\}
\end{aligned}
$$

In this equation:
- $s^{2}(\mathbf{x})$ is the conditional variance.
- $\pi_{k}(\mathbf{x})$ are the mixing coefficients.
- $\sigma_{k}^{2}(\mathbf{x})$ are the variances of the Gaussian components.
- $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}(\mathbf{x})$ are the means of the Gaussian components.
