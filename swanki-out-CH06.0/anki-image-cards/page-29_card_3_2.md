Explain the difference in model performance between the forward and inverse problems as shown in the figure.

The left plot represents a simple forward problem where a two-layer neural network has been fitted to the data by minimizing the sum-of-squares error function. The red curve fits the data points relatively well, despite some variance. The right plot represents the inverse problem, where the roles of $x$ and $t$ are exchanged. Here, due to the multimodality of the dataset, the same neural network model does not fit the data points as effectively, indicating a poor model fit for this more complex scenario.

## Effects of multimodality on model fitting

Why does the neural network model give a poor fit to the data in the inverse problem (right plot)?

%

The neural network model gives a poor fit to the data in the inverse problem because the dataset is multimodal. This means that there are multiple clusters or regimes within the data, which the model finds hard to capture with its fitted red curve. The model was trained using the same sum-of-squares error function as in the forward problem, but the complexity and non-Gaussian nature of the inverse problem's data lead to a less accurate fit despite using the same neural network structure.
