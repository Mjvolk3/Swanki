    The instance discrimination approach is illustrated, where the positive pair is made up of the anchor and an augmented version of the same image. These components are mapped to points in a normalized space, conceived as a unit hypersphere. The colored arrows indicate that the loss function encourages the representations of the positive pair to be closer together while pushing negative pairs further apart.

    ## How does the instance discrimination approach function in Figure 6.14 (a) to train models in contrastive learning?

    The instance discrimination approach functions by using the anchor and an augmented version of the same image to form a positive pair. These are then mapped onto a normalized representation space, conceptually a unit hypersphere. The loss function in this configuration drives the representations of the positive pair to be closer, while it forces representations of any negative pairs to be further apart.
