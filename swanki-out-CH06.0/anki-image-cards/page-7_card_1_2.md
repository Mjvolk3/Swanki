What does the dashed diagonal line in Figure 6.6(a) represent concerning the data points from the two classes?

%

The dashed diagonal line in Figure 6.6(a) represents the decision boundary that linearly separates the data points from the two classes, depicted by green and red circles. This indicates that a linear classifier could successfully classify the data points based on their values of features $x_1$ and $x_2$.

## Impact of Feature on Separability

How does the separability of the classes change if only the variable $x_1$ is measured, as shown in Figure 6.6(b)?

%

If only the variable $x_1$ is measured, as shown in Figure 6.6(b), the classes are no longer separable. This is because the single-feature ($x_1$) does not provide sufficient information to distinguish between the two classes that were separable in the two-dimensional feature space ($x_1, x_2$).
