## How does the simplistic approach shown in the image handle the classification of new test points?

The simplistic approach divides the input space into cells and assigns any new test point to the class that has the most representatives in the same cell as the test point. This is done using a basis function $\phi_{i}(\mathrm{x})$ for each grid cell, which returns zero if $\mathrm{x}$ lies outside the grid cell, and otherwise returns the majority class of the training data points within the cell.

## Explain one severe shortcoming of the simplistic approach as illustrated in the image.

One severe shortcoming of this simplistic approach is its reliance on rigid grid cells, which can result in poor generalization. Specifically, the model's performance is highly dependent on the cell boundaries and their alignment with the actual distribution of the data. This can lead to misclassification if a significant number of relevant data points fall just outside the cell containing the test point.
