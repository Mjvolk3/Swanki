Figure 6.7 illustrates examples of the handwritten digit "5" that differ in their vertical positions and orientations within their respective images. These variations suggest that the data points (images) lie on a nonlinear three-dimensional manifold within the high-dimensional image space, capturing the degrees of freedom related to the digit's position and orientation within the frame.

## How does associating localized basis functions with the data manifold reduce the number of required functions?

Associating localized basis functions with the data manifold reduces the number of required functions because the manifold typically has a much lower dimensionality than the entire high-dimensional data space. The number of required basis functions grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the manifold, which is less than the dimensionality of the data space, leading to a significant reduction in complexity.
