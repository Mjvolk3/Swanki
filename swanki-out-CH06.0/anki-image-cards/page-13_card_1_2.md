In the image, a neural network with two inputs, two hidden units (using tanh activation functions), and a single logistic-sigmoid output is used to classify synthetic data into two classes. The dashed blue lines represent the $z=0.5$ contours for the hidden units, while the solid red line is the $y=0.5$ decision surface of the network. The green lines show the optimal decision boundary derived from the data distributions.

- The dashed blue lines depict the $z=0.5$ contours for each hidden unit with tanh activation functions.
- The solid red line represents the $y=0.5$ decision surface for the neural network.
- The solid green line indicates the optimal decision boundary computed from the data distributions.

These lines illustrate how the neural network segments the data and compares its decision boundary to the ideal one.
