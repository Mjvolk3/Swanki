Explain the significance of using localized basis functions associated with the data manifold in the context of this image.

%

Using localized basis functions associated with the data manifold allows us to efficiently represent the data by limiting the number of required basis functions to grow exponentially with the dimensionality of the manifold instead of the higher-dimensional data space. Typically, the manifold has a much lower dimensionality, leading to a significant reduction in computational complexity.

Define a data manifold and describe its relevance in the context of machine learning using the provided image as an example.

%

A data manifold is a lower-dimensional surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space. In the context of machine learning, data manifolds help in understanding the structure and relationships of the data points. The provided image illustrates a three-dimensional nonlinear manifold within the higher-dimensional image space, where each image represents a point on the manifold despite variations in position and orientation of a handwritten digit. This conceptual approach helps in efficiently managing and interpreting high-dimensional data.
