What is the mathematical definition of the tanh function?

%

The tanh function is defined as:

$$
\tanh(a) = \frac{e^{a} - e^{-a}}{e^{a} + e^{-a}}
$$

Explain how the output of the tanh function differs from the logistic sigmoid function's output.

%

The output of the tanh function differs from that of the logistic sigmoid function in that it is a linear transformation of its input and output values. Specifically, while the logistic sigmoid function outputs values in the range $(0,1)$, the $\tanh$ function outputs values in the range $(-1,1)$. Therefore, for any network with logistic-sigmoid hidden-unit activation functions, there is an equivalent network with $\tanh$ activation functions.
