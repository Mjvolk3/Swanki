## How does the dimensionality \(D\) of a space affect the number of regions in a regular grid?

The number of regions in a regular grid grows exponentially with the dimensionality \(D\) of the space. Specifically, for a grid with $D$ dimensions and $n$ divisions per dimension, the total number of regions \(N\) is given by:

$$
N = n^D
$$

This phenomenon illustrates the "curse of dimensionality," where the volume of the space increases so rapidly that the number of cells becomes impractically large for high-dimensional spaces.
