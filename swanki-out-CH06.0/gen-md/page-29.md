## What are the Cartesian coordinates $\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)$ of the end effector in a two-link robot arm determined by?

In a two-link robot arm, the Cartesian coordinates $\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)$ of the end effector are determined uniquely by the two joint angles $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$ and the (fixed) lengths $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ of the arms. This concept is known as forward kinematics.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    x_1 &= L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \\
    x_2 &= L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\end{aligned}
$$

## In the context of a two-link robot arm, which problem involves finding the joint angles for a desired end effector position?

The problem that involves finding the joint angles that will result in a desired end effector position in a two-link robot arm is known as inverse kinematics.

## Describe a simple toy problem used to illustrate multimodality in high-dimensional spaces as mentioned in the context.

To illustrate multimodality, data is generated by sampling a variable $x$ uniformly over the interval $(0,1)$ to create a set of values $\{x_n\}$. The corresponding target values $t_n$ are computed using the function $x_n + 0.3 \sin(2 \pi x_n)$, with added uniform noise over $(-0.1,0.1)$. The inverse problem is obtained by exchanging the roles of $x$ and $t$.

## What does Figure 6.17 illustrate in terms of forward and inverse problems and their modeling performance?

Figure 6.17 shows the data sets for forward and inverse problems. The forward problem's data is fit well by minimizing sum-of-squares error using a two-layer neural network, while the inverse problem demonstrates a poor fit due to the data's multimodal nature.

## How is modeling conditional probability distributions generally achieved and what is utilized for $p(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x})$ in this context?

Modeling conditional probability distributions can be achieved using a mixture model for $p(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x})$.
