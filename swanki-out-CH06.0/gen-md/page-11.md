## What is the equation for the activation of the $j$-th hidden unit in a two-layer neural network, and how can the bias parameters be incorporated into the weight parameters?

The activation of the $j$-th hidden unit in a two-layer neural network is given by:

$$
a_{j} = \sum_{i=0}^{D} w_{j i}^{(1)} x_{i}
$$

where $a_{j}$ represents the activation, $w_{j i}^{(1)}$ are the weights, and $x_{i}$ are the input variables. The bias parameters are incorporated into the weight parameters by defining an additional input variable $x_{0}$ whose value is clamped at $x_{0}=1$.

## What function represents the overall output of a two-layer neural network with absorbed biases in the context of the hidden units?

The overall network function with absorbed biases into the weight parameters in the context of the hidden units is:

$$
y_{k}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) = f \left( \sum_{j=0}^{M} w_{k j}^{(2)} h \left( \sum_{i=0}^{D} w_{j i}^{(1)} x_{i} \right) \right)
$$

where $f(\cdot)$ is the output activation function, $h(\cdot)$ is the hidden layer activation function, and $w_{k j}^{(2)}$, $w_{j i}^{(1)}$ are the weight parameters.

## Transform the input into a column vector and represent the overall network function in matrix form.

The inputs are represented as a column vector $\mathbf{x}=\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{N}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}$. The overall network function in matrix form is then given by:

$$
\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w})=f \left( \mathbf{W}^{(2)} h \left( \mathbf{W}^{(1)} \mathbf{x} \right) \right)
$$

where $\mathbf{W}^{(1)}$ and $\mathbf{W}^{(2)}$ are the first and second-layer weight matrices, respectively.

## How do you represent the inputs and weight parameters for a two-layer neural network in matrix form?

The inputs are represented as a column vector:

$$
\mathbf{x} = \left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{N}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}
$$

The weight parameters for the first layer and second layer are gathered into matrices $\mathbf{W}^{(1)}$ and $\mathbf{W}^{(2)}$, respectively, to form the overall network function:

$$
\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) = f\left(\mathbf{W}^{(2)} h\left(\mathbf{W}^{(1)} \mathbf{x}\right)\right)
$$

## What is the significance of the hidden units in a two-layer neural network in terms of function approximation?

The hidden units in a two-layer neural network allow the network to approximate a broad range of functions. Each hidden unit works collaboratively to approximate the final function, effectively increasing the model's capability to capture complex patterns in the data.

## Describe how bias parameters are integrated into the weight parameters in a two-layer neural network.

The bias parameters in the neural network equation can be integrated into the weight parameters by introducing an additional input variable $x_{0}$, fixed at $x_{0}=1$. This redefinition allows the bias term to be treated as an additional weight:

$$
a_{j} = \sum_{i=0}^{D} w_{j i}^{(1)} x_{i}
$$

This adjustment simplifies the representation and computation of the neural network.
