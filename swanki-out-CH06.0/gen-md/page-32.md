## What is the equation used to introduce the variable $\gamma_{n k}$? Explain its components and their interpretation.

The variable $\gamma_{n k}$ is given by:

$$
\gamma_{n k}=\gamma_{k}\left(\mathbf{t}_{n} \mid \mathbf{x}_{n}\right)=\frac{\pi_{k} \mathcal{N}_{n k}}{\sum_{l=1}^{K} \pi_{l} \mathcal{N}_{n l}}
$$

- $\pi_{k}$: Mixing coefficient
- $\mathcal{N}_{n k}$: Multivariate normal distribution 
- $\sum_{l=1}^{K} \pi_{l} \mathcal{N}_{n l}$: Normalizing constant

$\gamma_{n k}$ represents the posterior probabilities for the components of the mixture where the mixing coefficients $\pi_{k}(\mathbf{x})$ are viewed as input-dependent prior probabilities.

## Derive the gradient of the error function $E_{n}$ with respect to the network output pre-activations governing the mixing coefficients $\pi_{k}$.

To derive the gradient of $E_{n}$ with respect to $a_{k}^{\pi}$, we use:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial a_{k}^{\pi}}=\pi_{k}-\gamma_{n k}
$$

- $E_{n}$: Error function
- $a_{k}^{\pi}$: Network output pre-activation for $\pi_{k}$
- $\gamma_{n k}$: Posterior probabilities

This tells us how the error changes concerning the network's prediction of the mixing coefficients.

## Describe how the derivatives of the error function are obtained with respect to the output pre-activations controlling the component means.

The derivative with respect to $a_{k l}^{\mu}$ is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial a_{k l}^{\mu}}=\gamma_{n k}\left\{\frac{\mu_{k l}-t_{n l}}{\sigma_{k}^{2}}\right\}
$$

- $a_{k l}^{\mu}$: Output pre-activation for component means
- $\gamma_{n k}$: Posterior probabilities
- $\mu_{k l}$: Mean of the component
- $t_{n l}$: Observed data
- $\sigma_{k}^{2}$: Variance of the component

This computes how the error changes with respect to the prediction of the component means.

## Explain the equation for the derivatives with respect to the output pre-activations controlling the component variances.

The gradient with respect to $a_{k}^{\sigma}$ is:

$$
\frac{\partial E_{n}}{\partial a_{k}^{\sigma}}=\gamma_{n k}\left\{L-\frac{\left\|\mathbf{t}_{n}-\boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}\right\|^{2}}{\sigma_{k}^{2}}\right\}
$$

- $a_{k}^{\sigma}$: Output pre-activation for component variances
- $\gamma_{n k}$: Posterior probabilities
- $L$: Dimension of $\mathbf{t}_{n}$
- $\mathbf{t}_{n}$: Observed data vector
- $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}$: Mean vector of the component
- $\sigma_{k}^{2}$: Variance of the component

This tells us how the error changes relative to the prediction of the component variances.

## What is the expression for the conditional mean of the target data given the input vector in a mixture density network?

The conditional mean $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}]$ is expressed as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}]=\int \mathbf{t} p(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{t}=\sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_{k}(\mathbf{x}) \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}(\mathbf{x})
$$

- $\pi_{k}(\mathbf{x})$: Mixing coefficient as a function of input $\mathbf{x}$
- $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}(\mathbf{x})$: Mean function of input $\mathbf{x}$ for the $k$-th component

This form allows prediction of the average target value for a given input.

- #math, #statistics, #mixture-density-networks

## In what way can a mixture density network provide a full probabilistic description of the target data for a given input?

A mixture density network predicts the conditional density function $p(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x})$, which gives a complete description of the target data distribution for any given input vector $\mathbf{x}$.

This includes modal behavior variation (unimodal/trimodal) and allows calculation of specific quantities such as the mean $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}]$:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}] = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_{k}(\mathbf{x}) \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}(\mathbf{x})
$$

Thus, the network encapsulates the entire probability distribution for prediction tasks.
