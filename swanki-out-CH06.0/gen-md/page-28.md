## Explain the appropriate output-unit activation functions and error functions for a regression problem and provide the necessary equations.

For regression problems, the appropriate choice of output-unit activation function is linear outputs, and the matching error function is the sum-of-squares error.

$$
E(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{y}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} (t_n - y_n)^2
$$

where:
- $E$ is the sum-of-squares error function,
- $\mathbf{t}$ represents the target values,
- $\mathbf{y}$ represents the network outputs,
- $N$ is the number of data points.

## For multiple independent binary classifications, what output-unit activation function and error function should be used?

For multiple independent binary classifications, we use logistic sigmoid outputs and a cross-entropy error function.

$$
E(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{y}) = -\sum_{n=1}^{N} [t_n \log y_n + (1 - t_n) \log (1 - y_n)]
$$

where:
- $E$ is the cross-entropy error function,
- $\mathbf{t}$ represents the target values,
- $\mathbf{y}$ represents the network outputs.

## What are the appropriate choices of output-unit activation and error functions for multi-class classification problems?

For multi-class classification problems, we use softmax outputs with the corresponding multi-class cross-entropy error function.

$$
y_k = \frac{e^{z_k}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}
$$

$$
E(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{y}) = -\sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} t_{nk} \log y_{nk}
$$

where:
- $y_k$ is the softmax function,
- $z_k$ are the input logits,
- $E$ is the multi-class cross-entropy error function,
- $\mathbf{t}$ represents the target values,
- $\mathbf{y}$ represents the network outputs,
- $K$ is the number of classes.

## Describe a mixture density network and its application in representing conditional probabilities in neural networks.

A mixture density network is a neural network that represents more general conditional probabilities by treating the network outputs as the parameters of a more complex distribution, specifically a Gaussian mixture model.

$$
p(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k(\mathbf{x}) \, \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{t} \mid \mu_k(\mathbf{x}), \Sigma_k(\mathbf{x}))
$$

where:
- $\pi_k(\mathbf{x})$ are the mixing coefficients,
- $\mu_k(\mathbf{x})$ are the means,
- $\Sigma_k(\mathbf{x})$ are the covariances,
- $K$ is the number of components in the mixture model.

These parameters are outputs of the neural network.

## What is the typical choice of conditional distribution and resulting error function in simple regression problems, and why might this be a poor choice in some practical applications?

In simple regression problems, the conditional distribution $p(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x})$ is typically chosen to be Gaussian, and the corresponding error function is the sum-of-squares error. However, this choice can lead to poor predictions in practical applications involving multimodal distributions.

$$
p(\mathbf{t} \mid \mathbf{x}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{t} \mid \mu(\mathbf{x}), \sigma^2)
$$

$$
E(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{y}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} (t_n - y_n)^2
$$

In practical applications, such as inverse problems where the distribution can be multimodal, the Gaussian assumption may not be suitable.

## What is an inverse problem in the context of machine learning, and how does it differ from forward problems?

An inverse problem in machine learning involves predicting the cause given the effect, whereas a forward problem involves predicting the effect given the cause. Inverse problems often have multiple solutions because they involve many-to-one mappings.

For example, in the context of robot kinematics:
- Forward Problem: Predicting the end effector position given the joint angles.
- Inverse Problem: Setting appropriate joint angles to achieve a specific end effector position, which may have multiple solutions.
