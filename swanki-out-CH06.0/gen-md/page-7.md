## What does Figure 6.6 illustrate about class separability in a two-dimensional dataset?

- Figure 6.6 illustrates a two-dimensional dataset $\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)$ where data points from two classes, depicted using green and red circles, can be separated by a linear decision surface in (a). However, if only $x_{1}$ is measured, the classes are no longer separable as shown in (b).
  
  The key takeaway is that reducing dimensionality can affect class separability.

## Given the high dimensionality of an image determined by its pixels, explain the concept of images living on a lower-dimensional manifold.

- Each image is a point in a high-dimensional space determined by the number of pixels. Variability among images (due to position, orientation) suggests that images live on a three-dimensional manifold embedded within this high-dimensional space. This manifold is highly nonlinear due to complex relationships between object position/orientation and pixel intensities. The dimensionality $D$ of the data space is high, but the manifold's dimensionality remains much lower.

## Explain how capturing an image at higher resolution affects the data space and the underlying manifold.

- Capturing the same image at a higher resolution increases the dimensionality $D$ of the data space but does not change the fact that the images live on a three-dimensional manifold. The number of required basis functions grows exponentially with the manifold's dimensionality rather than the data space's dimensionality. The manifold typically has a much lower dimensionality.

## Why might the number of required basis functions grow exponentially with the dimensionality of the manifold rather than the dimensionality of the data space?

- The number of required basis functions might grow exponentially with the dimensionality of the manifold rather than that of the data space because localized basis functions are associated with the data manifold. Since the manifold generally has a much lower dimensionality than the data space, fewer basis functions are needed, representing an efficient computational strategy.

## Describe the relationship between object position/orientation and pixel intensities according to the provided text.

- The relationship between object position/orientation and pixel intensities is complex and nonlinear. Variabilities like horizontal and vertical positions and orientations of an object within images suggest that these properties correspond to a three-dimensional manifold in the high-dimensional pixel intensity space.

## On what type of manifold do the images of a handwritten digit, that differ in location and orientation, live according to the text?

- The images of a handwritten digit that vary in location and orientation live on a nonlinear three-dimensional manifold within the high-dimensional image space. This indicates that despite the high-dimensional pixel data, the inherent variability is confined to a lower-dimensional structure.
