## What is the role of a two-layer neural network in approximating different types of functions?

A two-layer neural network can approximate various types of functions such as $f(x)=x^2$, $f(x)=\sin(x)$, $f(x)=|x|$, and $f(x)=H(x)$. In these cases, the network has 50 data points sampled uniformly over the interval $(-1,1)$ and uses three hidden units with tanh activation functions and linear output units to train.

$$ f(x)=x^2 $$
$$ f(x)=\sin(x) $$
$$ f(x)=|x| $$
$$ f(x)=H(x) $$

### Card 2 

## Explain the universal approximation theorem related to two-layer feed-forward networks.

The universal approximation theorem states that for a wide range of activation functions, two-layer feed-forward networks can approximate any function defined over a continuous subset of $\mathbb{R}^D$ to arbitrary accuracy. This result shows these networks are universal approximators.

### Card 3 

## What are some limitations of universal approximation theorems concerning practical applications of neural networks?

Although universal approximation theorems indicate the existence of networks capable of representing any required function, they do not guarantee that such networks can be found by learning algorithms or that they will not require an exponentially large number of hidden units. Additionally, they do not provide insights into the efficiency or practicality of training such networks.

### Card 4 

## Why might deep learning be advantageous compared to a network with only two layers of weights?

Networks with many more than two layers can learn hierarchical internal representations, which can provide significant benefits in practical applications beyond what two-layer networks can achieve.

### Card 5 

## According to the no free lunch theorem, can a universally optimal machine learning algorithm exist?

No, the no free lunch theorem asserts that there cannot be a truly universal machine learning algorithm that performs optimally for all possible problems.

### Card 6 

## What is the primary requirement for hidden unit activation functions in neural networks, and why?

The primary requirement for hidden unit activation functions in neural networks is differentiability. This is necessary to enable the use of gradient-based optimization methods during the training process.

$$ \text{hidden unit activation function} \quad g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \quad \text{such that} \quad g \in C^1(\mathbb{R}) $$
