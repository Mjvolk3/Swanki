## What is a major shortcoming of dividing the input space into cells for classification problems, as mentioned in the paper?

The major shortcoming of this approach becomes apparent when dealing with higher dimensional input spaces. Specifically, the number of cells grows exponentially with the dimensionality $D$ of the space.

## Explain how basis functions are used in the grid cell classification approach.

In the grid cell classification approach, each grid cell has a corresponding basis function $\phi_{i}(\mathrm{x})$, which returns zero if $\mathrm{x}$ lies outside the grid cell and otherwise returns the majority class of the training data points within the cell. The model output is the sum of the outputs of all basis functions.

$$
\text{Output} = \sum_{i} \phi_{i}(\mathrm{x})
$$

## What is the curse of dimensionality in the context of classification models that use grid cells?

The curse of dimensionality refers to the exponential growth of the number of grid cells as the dimensionality $D$ of the input space increases. This exponential growth requires an exponentially large quantity of training data to accurately classify new points.

## What happens to the number of regions or cells when the dimensionality $D$ of the input space increases?

When the dimensionality $D$ increases, the number of regions or cells grows exponentially.

$$
\text{Number of Cells} \propto a^D
$$

where $a$ is a constant.

## Cloze card to illustrate the understanding of specific detail in grid based classification

In grid cell classification, the basis function $\phi_{i}(\mathrm{x})$ returns {{c1:: zero if $\mathrm{x}$ lies outside the grid cell}} and otherwise returns {{c1:: the majority class of training data points within the cell}}.

## What is the impact of having an exponentially large number of cells in a classification model using grid cells?

An exponentially large number of cells means that a similarly large quantity of training data is required to ensure that each cell contains a sufficient number of training points for accurate classification. This becomes impractical as dimensionality increases.
