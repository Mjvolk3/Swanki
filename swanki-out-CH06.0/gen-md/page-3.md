## Considering the curse of dimensionality, how does the growth in the number of independent coefficients scale for a polynomial of order $M$?

The growth in the number of independent coefficients for a polynomial of order $M$ scales as $\mathcal{O}\left( D^{M} \right)$.

## What is the equation for the model $y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w})$ that describes the sum of contributions from polynomial terms up to degree 3?

The model $y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w})$ is given by:

$$
y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w})=w_{0} + \sum_{i=1}^{D} w_{i} x_{i} + \sum_{i=1}^{D} \sum_{j=1}^{D} w_{i j} x_{i} x_{j} + \sum_{i=1}^{D} \sum_{j=1}^{D} \sum_{k=1}^{D} w_{i j k} x_{i} x_{j} x_{k}
$$

Where:
- $w_0$ is the intercept term
- $w_i$, $w_{ij}$, and $w_{ijk}$ are coefficients for linear, quadratic and cubic terms respectively
- $\mathbf{x}$ is the input vector
- $D$ is the dimensionality of the input space

## Describe the concept of "the curse of dimensionality" as related to polynomial regression.

The curse of dimensionality refers to the phenomena where, as the number of dimensions $D$ increases, the complexity of model training and the necessary data grows exponentially, making it impractical for high-dimensional spaces. In polynomial regression, this problem manifests as a rapid increase in the number of coefficients needed, scaling as $\mathcal{O}(D^{M})$ for a polynomial of order $M$.

## Given 150 observations from the Iris data set, each observing sepal length and sepal width, how would you intuitively decide the class for a new test point?

For a new test point, classify it by examining its proximity to points from the training set. Points that are closer have a stronger influence on the classification. This intuition posits that the new test point's class is most likely the same as the class of the nearest training points.

## How can dividing the input space into regular cells help in converting intuition into a classification algorithm for the Iris data set?

By dividing the input space into regular cells, one can implement a simple nearest-neighbor approach. When a test point is given, determine which cell it resides in and use the majority class of that cell to predict the class of the test point.

## Why is it suggested that a test point in the Iris data set might belong to the class determined by nearby points rather than distant points?

Nearby points from the training set are assumed to have more relevance to the test point's classification because they share more similar feature values. Distant points are less similar and, therefore, less reliable indicators of the test point's class. This aligns with the concept of a local decision rule in classification.
