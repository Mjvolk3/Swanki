## Describe a linear basis function model for classification. 

A linear basis function model for classification can be described as:

$$
y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) = f\left(\sum_{j=1}^{M} w_{j} \phi_{j}(\mathbf{x}) + w_{0}\right)
$$

where:
- $f(\cdot)$ is a nonlinear output activation function.
- $\mathbf{w}$ is a vector of learnable weights.
- $\phi_{j}(\mathbf{x})$ represents the fixed basis functions.

This model approximates the output $y$ using a weighted sum of the basis functions plus a bias term.

## What is a major limitation of linear models with fixed basis functions?

DThe major limitation of linear models with fixed basis functions $\phi_{j}(\mathbf{x})$ is that they are independent of the training data. Consequently, the basis functions may not be optimally suited for the specific problem at hand, potentially leading to suboptimal performance.

These limitations become significant, especially as the number of input variables increases.

## Explain polynomial regression with a single input variable. Include the equation. 

Polynomial regression with a single input variable is given by:

$$
y(x, \mathbf{w}) = w_{0} + w_{1} x + w_{2} x^{2} + \ldots + w_{M} x^{M}
$$

where:
- $x$ is the input variable.
- $\mathbf{w}$ is a vector of weights.
- $M$ denotes the order of the polynomial.

This model fits a polynomial of degree $M$ to the input data $x$ to approximate the output $y$.

## What is the 'curse of dimensionality' in the context of linear models?

The 'curse of dimensionality' refers to the exponential increase in the complexity of a model as the number of input variables $D$ increases. For a linear basis function model, this means the number of parameters to estimate increases dramatically, making it challenging to find an optimal solution and often leading to overfitting and poor generalization.

## Describe the general form of a linear regression model with multiple input variables.

In the context of multiple input variables $\left\{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{D}\right\}$, a linear regression model can be expressed as:

$$
y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) = w_{0} + \sum_{i=1}^{D} w_{i} x_{i} + \sum_{i \leq j} w_{ij} x_{i} x_{j} + \sum_{i \leq j \leq k} w_{ijk} x_{i} x_{j} x_{k} + \ldots
$$

Here, $w_0$, $w_i$, $w_{ij}$, $w_{ijk}$, etc., are the weights to be learned and $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_D)$ are the input variables.

This model fits a polynomial function of the input variables $\left\{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{D}\right\}$ to the output $y$.

## Why is it beneficial to use neural networks with learned basis functions over fixed basis functions?

Neural networks with learned basis functions can adapt to the specific characteristics of the training data, thus providing a more flexible and powerful model compared to linear models with fixed basis functions. By learning the basis functions directly from the data, neural networks can capture complex patterns and relationships that fixed basis function models may miss, especially as the number of input variables increases.
