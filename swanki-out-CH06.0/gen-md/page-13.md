## What is the equation for the logistic sigmoid activation function commonly used in neural networks?

The logistic sigmoid activation function is given by:
$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)}
$$

This function is useful for transforming the output of a neuron into a probability value between 0 and 1, making it especially valuable in classification problems.

## Describe the transformation properties of a network with only linear activation functions.

If a neural network only has linear activation functions, it performs a linear transformation. Specifically, consider a network with $N$ inputs, $M$ hidden units, and $K$ outputs. If all activation functions are linear, the transformation can be described as:

- The network with hidden units has $M(N+K)$ parameters.
- A direct linear transformation from inputs to outputs would have $NK$ parameters.
- If $M$ is small relative to $N$ or $K$, this results in a rank-deficient transformation.

This setup is equivalent to Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## In a neural network with hidden units using linear activation functions, explain when it becomes equivalent to performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

When the number of hidden units $M$ is small relative to the number of input units $N$ or output units $K$ (or both), the network with linear activation functions results in a 'bottleneck'. This bottleneck network with linear units effectively performs a rank-deficient transformation, akin to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), by reducing dimensionality.

## Why is there limited interest in using multilayer networks of linear units?

Multilayer networks of linear units are of limited interest because the overall function computed by such a network is still linear. No matter the number of layers, the composition of successive linear transformations results in another linear transformation. This does not improve the representational capability beyond that of a single linear layer.

$$
f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{W_2}( \mathbf{W_1} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b_1}) + \mathbf{b_2}
$$

Ultimately simplifies to:

$$
f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{W'} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b'}
$$

## Explain the implications of using the identity function as an activation function in neural networks.

Using the identity function as an activation function implies that all hidden units become linear. For such networks:

- The network essentially performs a linear transformation.
- This does not increase representational capabilities beyond a single linear layer.
- If the hidden layer has fewer units than input/output dimensions, it results in dimensionality reduction.
  
In most practical applications, nonlinear activation functions are preferred to introduce non-linearity and improve the network’s representational power.

## What is the difference between using linear and nonlinear activation functions in neural networks?

Linear activation functions yield linear transformations, which do not increase representational capabilities beyond that of a single linear layer. In contrast, using nonlinear activation functions, such as the logistic sigmoid function:

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-a)}
$$

- Introduces non-linearity.
- Enhances the network’s capability to capture complex patterns in data.
- Allows for hierarchical feature extraction, which is crucial for learning intricate functions.
