## Considering the fraction of the volume of a hypersphere of radius $r=1$ in $D$ dimensions lying between $r=1-\epsilon$ and $r=1$, how is the volume $V_{D}(r)$ of the hypersphere expressed in terms of $r$ and $D$?

The volume $V_{D}(r)$ of a hypersphere of radius $r$ in $D$ dimensions can be expressed as:

$$
V_{D}(r)=K_{D} r^{D}
$$

where $K_{D}$ is a constant that depends only on the dimensionality $D$. This relation implies that the volume scales with the $D$th power of the radius.

## How can we evaluate the fraction of the volume of a hypersphere that lies between $r=1-\epsilon$ and $r=1$ in terms of $D$ and $\epsilon$?

The fraction of the volume of the hypersphere that lies between $r=1-\epsilon$ and $r=1$ can be evaluated as:

$$
\frac{V_{D}(1)-V_{D}(1-\epsilon)}{V_{D}(1)} = 1 - (1-\epsilon)^{D}
$$

This formula captures the proportion of the volume that resides in the thin shell near the surface of the hypersphere.

## What is the remarkable result we arrive at when evaluating the fraction of the volume of a hypersphere for high dimensions $D$?

For large values of $D$, the fraction of the volume $1-(1-\epsilon)^{D}$ tends to 1 even for small values of $\epsilon$. This implies that, in spaces of high dimensionality, most of the volume of a hypersphere is concentrated in a thin shell near the surface.

## How does the fraction $1-(1-\epsilon)^D$ behave as $D \to \infty$?

As $D$ approaches infinity, the fraction $1-(1-\epsilon)^{D}$ tends to 1, meaning that for large $D$, even a small $\epsilon$ results in most of the volume being concentrated near the surface of the hypersphere.

$$
\lim_{D \to \infty} (1-(1-\epsilon)^{D}) = 1
$$

## What does the concentration of volume near the surface of a hypersphere in high-dimensional spaces imply about our geometrical intuitions?

This concentration of volume implies that our geometrical intuitions, which are based on three-dimensional space experiences, can fail badly in higher dimensions. It highlights the need for different approaches when dealing with problems in high-dimensional spaces.

## How can the choice of basis functions affect the performance of machine learning models in high-dimensional spaces?

Choosing basis functions independently of the problem being solved (as in polynomial regression and Iris data classification examples) can lead to difficulties due to the curse of dimensionality. A more sophisticated choice of basis functions is needed to circumvent these issues in high-dimensional spaces.
