## Explain the concept of radial basis functions (RBF) and describe the form of a typical RBF.

Radial basis functions (RBF) are basis functions that depend only on the radial distance (typically Euclidean) from a central vector. A typical choice for a radial basis function $\phi_{n}(\mathbf{x})$ for a data point $\mathbf{x}$, where the basis centers are chosen to be the input data values $\left\{\mathbf{x}_{n}\right\}$, is given by:

$$
\phi_{n}(\mathbf{x})=\exp \left(-\frac{\left\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{n}\right\|^{2}}{s^{2}}\right)
$$

Here, $s$ is a parameter controlling the width of the basis function. Each basis function captures the data manifold around the corresponding data point $\mathbf{x}_{n}$.

## Explain why careful regularization is important in models utilizing radial basis functions (RBF).

Careful regularization is important in models utilizing radial basis functions (RBF) to avoid severe over-fitting. 

%
Without regularization, the model may fit the training data too closely, capturing noise as well as the underlying data pattern. This over-fitting can severely degrade the model's performance on new, unseen data, leading to poor generalization.

## What is the primary mechanism by which Support Vector Machines (SVM) addresses the computational unwieldiness of having one basis function per data point?

Support Vector Machines (SVM) address the computational unwieldiness by selecting a subset of basis functions automatically during training. 

%
This process ensures that the effective number of basis functions in the resulting model is much smaller than the total number of training points. However, the subset still often increases with the size of the training set.

## What is the major difference between traditional approaches using basis functions and modern data-driven approaches in machine learning?

Traditional approaches using basis functions relied on a combination of domain knowledge and trial-and-error, whereas modern data-driven approaches learn basis functions directly from the training data.

%
Domain knowledge in modern methods plays a more qualitative role, mainly in designing network architectures to capture appropriate inductive bias.

## Why are neural networks considered superior to methods like radial basis functions and support vector machines in modern machine learning tasks?

Neural networks are considered superior because they can exploit very large datasets efficiently, and they are capable of learning deep hierarchical representations, which are crucial for achieving high prediction accuracy in complex applications.

%
Methods like radial basis functions and support vector machines have been largely superseded by deep neural networks because of these advantages.

## What is one of the limitations of support vector machines (SVM) in terms of output and generalization?

One of the limitations of support vector machines (SVM) is that they do not produce probabilistic outputs and do not naturally generalize to more than two classes.

%
This limitation can be a disadvantage in applications where probabilistic interpretations are important or where multi-class generalization is needed.
