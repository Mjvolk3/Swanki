## Explain the primary goal of contrastive learning and how it achieves this objective.

Contrastive learning aims to learn a representation space where positive pairs of inputs (semantically similar) are close together, and negative pairs (semantically dissimilar) are far apart. This is achieved through the use of a loss function that rewards close proximity for positive pairs and penalizes proximity for negative pairs.

## Define few-shot learning and one-shot learning in the context of meta-learning.

Few-shot learning is a technique to generalize a model to new classes when there are very few labeled examples of those classes. When only a single labeled example is used, it is called one-shot learning.

## Describe InfoNCE loss and provide its mathematical formulation.

InfoNCE loss is the most commonly used loss function for contrastive learning. It is designed to maximize the similarity between positive pairs and minimize the similarity between negative pairs.

$$
E(\mathbf{w}) = -\ln \frac{\exp \left\{\mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x})^{T} \mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{w}}\left(\mathbf{x}^{+}\right)\right\}}{\exp \left\{\mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x})^{T} \mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{w}}\left(\mathbf{x}^{+}\right)\right\}+\sum_{n=1}^{N} \exp \left\{\mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x})^{T} \mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{w}}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}^{-}\right)\right\}}
$$

## In the InfoNCE loss function, what is the role of the cosine similarity between the representations of the anchor and the positive example?

The cosine similarity $\mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x})^{T} \mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x}^{+})$ provides the measure of how close the positive pair examples are in the learned space.

## Briefly explain how the neural network function $Â£mathbf{f}_{\mathrm{w}}(\mathbf{x})$ is used in contrastive learning.

In contrastive learning, the neural network function $\mathbf{f}_{\mathrm{w}}(\mathbf{x})$ maps points from the input space $\mathrm{x}$ to a representation space, governed by parameters $\mathrm{w}$. The outputs are normalized such that $\left\|\mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x})\right\|=1$.

## How does contrastive learning differ from traditional supervised learning when it comes to the error function?

In contrastive learning, the error function for a given input is defined only with respect to other inputs, instead of having a per-input label or target output.
