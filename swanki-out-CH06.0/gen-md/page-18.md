## Describe the concept of representation learning in deep neural networks.

Representation learning in deep neural networks involves transforming the original data into a new space where it becomes easier to solve the desired tasks. For example, a neural network trained to classify skin lesions into benign or malignant must transform the initial image data into a representation where a simple linear classifier can effectively separate the two classes.

The learned representation, or the embedding space, is defined by the outputs of the hidden layers of the network. This space allows any input to be transformed into this representation via forward propagation.

## Explain how a hidden layer with $M$ units could represent $2^{M}$ different features in a neural network.

A hidden layer with $M$ units could represent $2^{M}$ different features because each unit can independently be either 'on' or 'off', which results in every possible combination of these binary states. Thus, the total number of unique feature combinations is $2^{M}$.

For instance, in a network processing face images, features like glasses, hats, and beards could be represented compactly by three units, each turning on if the corresponding attribute is present. This results in $2^3 = 8$ different combinations of these features.

## How can neural networks exploit unlabelled data for training?

Neural networks can exploit unlabelled data through unsupervised learning algorithms, such as training autoencoders. An autoencoder is a type of neural network that takes input data and attempts to reconstruct it as output. To make this task meaningful, the network uses hidden layers with fewer units than the number of input features, forcing it to learn a compressed representation of the data.

For example, in the case of image data, the network uses the images both as input vectors and target vectors, thereby learning a form of data compression without requiring labeled examples.

## What is the main challenge when using autoencoders for learning from unlabelled data?

The main challenge when using autoencoders for learning from unlabelled data is to force the network to learn a meaningful compression of the data. This is achieved by using hidden layers that have fewer units than the number of input features, which compels the network to capture the most important aspects of the data in a compressed form.

For instance, if an autoencoder is used on image data with fewer hidden units than the number of pixels, it must learn to represent the image in a more compact form.

## What does it mean for a neural network's final layer to act as a simple linear classifier?

In neural networks, the final layer often acts as a simple linear classifier. This means that after transforming the input data through multiple hidden layers, the network's last layer is designed to linearly separate the transformed data into different classes.

Mathematically, if the output of the final hidden layer is $\mathbf{h}$, and the weights of the final linear layer are $\mathbf{W}$, then the classification output $\mathbf{y}$ is given by:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{W} \mathbf{h}
$$

This transformation $\mathbf{h}$ should be such that it makes the classes linearly separable.

## What is the purpose of representation learning in the context of solving tasks using neural networks?

The purpose of representation learning in the context of solving tasks using neural networks is to discover a nonlinear transformation of the data that simplifies subsequent tasks. By learning an appropriate representation, neural networks can make the problem space easier to navigate and solve, particularly through the use of hidden layers that progressively transform the data into forms that are more suitable for linear separation and classification.

For example, in classifying skin lesions, the network must create a representation in the final hidden layer where malignant and benign lesions are easily distinguishable by a linear classifier.
