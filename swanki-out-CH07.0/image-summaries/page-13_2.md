ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a two-dimensional plot with coordinate axes labeled \(u_1\) and \(u_2\). The contour lines create a series of elliptical shapes indicating the gradient of a function, likely representing an error surface in the context of optimization. At the center, the ellipses are denser, representing the point of the minimum error. A path marked by arrows shows an iterative process moving toward this minimum point. This path likely represents the progression of a gradient descent algorithm with a momentum term, as the path shows smoother transitions without oscillating back and forth, indicating the 'smoothing' effect of the momentum term in dealing with the problem of differing eigenvalues in the gradient descent optimization process.
