ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a scatter plot with two different sets of data points on a two-dimensional coordinate system. There are red circular points, which represent the original data set for two variables before normalization. There are also blue crosses, which represent the same data set after undergoing normalization. The normalization process has adjusted the data points such that each variable now has zero mean and unit variance across the data set, as stated in the provided text. The axes \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) likely represent the two variables of interest; the normalization aligns both sets of data to a common scale, centered around the origin of the graph.
