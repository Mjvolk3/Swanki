ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image shows a two-dimensional plot with coordinate axes marked as \(w_1\) and \(w_2\). There are two vectors, labeled as \(u_1\) and \(u_2\), which are perpendicular to each other, indicating that they may represent orthogonal eigenvectors. A point labeled \(w^*\) is at the intersection of these two vectors, suggesting it could represent the minimum of an error function where the gradient is zero.

An ellipse is drawn around the point \(w^*\), which seems to represent contours of constant error. The major and minor axes of the ellipse are aligned with the eigenvectors \(u_1\) and \(u_2\). The lengths of these axes are inversely proportional to the square root of the corresponding eigenvalues, as indicated by the notations \(-1/\sqrt{\lambda_1}\) and \(-1/\sqrt{\lambda_2}\), where \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\) are eigenvalues associated with \(u_1\) and \(u_2\), respectively.

This diagram is typically used to illustrate the geometric interpretation of a quadratic approximation to the error function at a minimum point, in the context of optimization problems such as those encountered in training neural networks. The point \(w^*\) specifically corresponds to a local minimum of the error surface in weight space. The eigenvectors provide a basis for defining a coordinate system in which the Hessian matrix is diagonal, simplifying the analysis of the error function's behavior near the minimum.
