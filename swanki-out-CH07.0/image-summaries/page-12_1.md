ChatGPT figure/image summary: The image depicts a schematic illustration of the effect of adding a momentum term to the gradient descent algorithm. In the diagram, there's a curve representing an error function (E), with a red line indicating the path towards the function's minimum. Several weight updates are shown along this path, represented by black arrows (\(\Delta \mathbf{w}^{(1)}\), \(\Delta \mathbf{w}^{(2)}\), ...), which illustrate the progression of weights (\(\mathbf{w}\)) at each step.

The purpose of this illustration is to show how the momentum term in the gradient descent algorithm can enable a more rapid descent towards the minimum of the error function by effectively increasing the steps' size and smoothing out their trajectory, particularly when navigating a valley-like shape of the error surface. 

This visual aids in conveying how the practical application of a momentum term can substantially accelerate the optimization process compared to a standard gradient descent without momentum, which is likely to take smaller, less directed steps, as discussed in the text describing Figure 7.3. The dips between the arrows suggest potential overshooting that could happen without the momentum term, which is indicated by the smoothness of the trajectory with the momentum term included.
