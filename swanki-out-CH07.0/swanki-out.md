    Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used to adjust the parameters (weights and biases) of neural networks to minimize an error function. It helps in finding a suitable setting for these parameters based on a set of training data. By iteratively moving in the direction of the negative gradient of the error function, gradient descent seeks to reduce the error and improve the model's performance on the training data.

### Card 1

## What is depicted by the ellipses in Figure 7.3 and what problem can occur with gradient descent in this scenario?

The ellipses in Figure 7.3 depict an error surface $E$ that has the form of a long valley with substantially different curvatures along different directions. In this scenario, the local negative gradient vector $-\nabla E$ does not point towards the minimum of the error function for most points in weight space. This can cause successive steps of gradient descent to oscillate across the valley, leading to very slow progress along the valley towards the minimum.

- #machine-learning, #optimization.gradient-descent, #error-function

---

### Card 2

## What is the impact of the curvature variation in the error surface on the gradient descent process?

When the curvature of $E$ varies significantly with direction, creating a 'valley', the local gradient vector for batch gradient descent, which is perpendicular to the local contour, does not point directly towards the minimum. This causes oscillations across the valley, making progress slow and inefficient.

### Card 3

## Why do the vectors $\mathbf{u}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{u}_{2}$ play a significant role in the context of gradient descent as illustrated in Figure 7.3?

The vectors $\mathbf{u}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{u}_{2}$ are the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix. They indicate the directions of principal curvature of the error function. Understanding the eigenvectors helps in visualizing how gradient descent could oscillate and slow down when there are significantly different curvatures along different directions.

### Card 4

## How can the scale $\epsilon$ of the initialization distribution be determined for a neural network unit with M inputs, and what is the importance of this scale?

The scale $\epsilon$ of the initialization distribution for a neural network unit with $M$ inputs can be calculated as:

$$
\epsilon=\sqrt{\frac{2}{M}}
$$

This scale ensures that the initial weights are appropriately small, which can be crucial for training neural networks, especially to ensure most pre-activations are initially active during learning.

- #machine-learning, #neural-networks.initialization, #hyperparameters

---

### Card 5

## Why are bias parameters typically set to small positive values in neural network initialization, and how does this help with ReLU units?

Bias parameters are typically set to small positive values to ensure that most pre-activations are initially active during learning. This is particularly helpful with ReLU units because it ensures that the pre-activations are positive, providing a non-zero gradient to drive learning.

### Card 6

## Explain the relationship between the learning rate $\eta$ and the efficiency of the gradient descent process depicted in Figure 7.3.

In the scenario depicted in Figure 7.3, the learning rate $\eta$ influences the step size of the gradient descent process. Although a higher $\eta$ might intuitively seem to lead to faster convergence, it can cause oscillations that become divergent if $\eta$ is too large. As a result, $\eta$ must be kept sufficiently small to avoid divergent oscillations, causing the gradient descent to take many small steps and be very inefficient.

- #machine-learning, #optimization.gradient-descent, #learning-rate

## Using the gradient descent formula (7.16) and orthonormality relation (7.9), what expression do we obtain for the change in $\alpha_i$ at each step of the gradient descent algorithm?

Using the gradient descent formula and orthonormality relation, the expression for the change in $\alpha_i$ at each step is:

$$
\Delta \alpha_{i}=-\eta \lambda_{i} \alpha_{i}
$$

where:
- $\Delta \alpha_{i}$ is the change in coefficient $\alpha_{i}$.
- $\eta$ is the learning rate.
- $\lambda_{i}$ is the eigenvalue associated with the direction $u_{i}$.
- $\alpha_{i}$ is the coefficient at the current step, representing the distance to the minimum along the direction $u_{i}$.

- #gradient-descent, #eigenvalues, #optimization

## If we start with an initial $\alpha_i^{(0)}$, how will $\alpha_i$ evolve after $T$ steps in gradient descent?

After $T$ steps, $\alpha_i$ will evolve according to the formula:

$$
\alpha_{i}^{(T)}=\left(1-\eta \lambda_{i}\right)^{T} \alpha_{i}^{(0)}
$$

This shows that $\alpha_i$ decreases exponentially over iterations with a factor $(1 - \eta \lambda_i)$. 

- #gradient-descent, #eigenvalues, #convergence-rate

## Combining equations (7.24) and (7.25) with the gradient descent formula (7.16), derive the expression for the update in $\alpha_i$.

The combined equations give us:

$$
\Delta \alpha_{i}=-\eta \lambda_{i} \alpha_{i}
$$

From this, it follows that the new value $\alpha_i^{\text{new}}$ is:

$$
\alpha_{i}^{\text {new }}=\left(1-\eta \lambda_{i}\right) \alpha_{i}^{\text {old }}
$$

- #gradient-descent, #optimization, #eigenvalues

## What condition must hold to ensure that the limit $T \rightarrow \infty$ leads to $\alpha_i = 0$?

The condition that must hold is:

$$
\left|1-\eta \lambda_{i}\right|<1
$$

This ensures that $\alpha_i$ will converge to 0 as $T$ approaches infinity.

- #gradient-descent, #convergence, #optimization

## Explain how $\eta$ affects the speed of convergence in gradient descent and the limit on its value.

The factor $(1 - \eta \lambda_i)$ determines the speed of convergence. Increasing $\eta$ makes this factor smaller, thus improving convergence. However, the value of $\eta$ must be less than $2 / \lambda_{\max}$ to ensure $\left|1-\eta \lambda_{i}\right|<1$ and prevent divergence.

- #convergence-rate, #learning-rate, #optimization

## Why does the smallest eigenvalue dominate the rate of convergence when $\eta$ is set to its largest permissible value?

When $\eta$ is set to its largest allowable value, the convergence rate is governed by:

$$
\left(1-\frac{2 \lambda_{\min }}{\lambda_{\max }}\right)
$$

Because this factor is determined by the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\min}$, it slows down the convergence along the direction associated with $\lambda_{\min}$.

## Explain the role of the momentum term $(\mu)$ in gradient descent and its impact on the learning rate.

The momentum term $\mu$ plays a crucial role in gradient descent optimization. It effectively adds inertia to the motion through weight space, smoothing out oscillations and potentially speeding up convergence. The modified gradient descent formula is:

$$
\Delta \mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}=-\eta \nabla E\left(\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}\right)+\mu \Delta \mathbf{w}^{(\tau-2)}
$$

When applied iteratively under the assumption that the gradient $\nabla E$ is constant, the effective learning rate is increased from $\eta$ to $\eta / (1-\mu)$ as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta \mathbf{w} & =-\eta \nabla E\left\{1+\mu+\mu^{2}+\ldots\right\} \\
& =-\frac{\eta}{1-\mu} \nabla E
\end{aligned}
$$

## In the context of gradient descent with momentum, define the condition number and explain its relevance to the optimization process.

The condition number related to the Hessian matrix $H$ of the error function $E$ is defined as the ratio $\lambda_{\min} / \lambda_{\max}$, where $\lambda_{\min}$ and $\lambda_{\max}$ are the smallest and largest eigenvalues of $H$, respectively. This ratio is significant because:

- If $\lambda_{\min}/\lambda_{\max}$ is small, the error contours are highly elongated ellipses, indicating slow progress towards the minimum due to the steep curvatures in the error surface.
- Adding a momentum term helps mitigate this issue by smoothing oscillations and updating the weight vector more effectively.

## Describe the impact of the error surface's curvature on gradient descent with a fixed learning rate.

Figure 7.4 illustrates that with a fixed learning rate parameter, gradient descent on a surface with low curvature results in successively smaller steps, corresponding to linear convergence. In such a scenario, adding a momentum term effectively increases the learning rate by transforming it from $\eta$ to $\eta / (1-\mu)$, thereby promoting faster convergence.

$$
\Delta \mathbf{w} = -\frac{\eta}{1-\mu} \nabla E
$$

## Provide the modified gradient descent formula incorporating the momentum term and explain each component.

The modified gradient descent formula including the momentum term $(\mu)$ is:

$$
\Delta \mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)} = -\eta \nabla E\left(\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}\right) + \mu \Delta \mathbf{w}^{(\tau-2)}
$$

- $\Delta \mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}$: change in the weight vector at iteration $(\tau-1)$.
- $\eta$: learning rate.
- $\nabla E\left(\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}\right)$: gradient of the error function at iteration $(\tau-1)$.
- $\mu \Delta \mathbf{w}^{(\tau-2)}$: momentum term, where $\mu$ is the momentum parameter and $\Delta \mathbf{w}^{(\tau-2)}$ is the change in the previous iteration.

## Explain the convergence behavior of gradient descent in regions of low curvature vs. high curvature.

In regions of low curvature, gradient descent with a fixed learning rate converges linearly, and the momentum term increases the effective learning rate:

$$
\Delta \mathbf{w} = -\frac{\eta}{1-\mu} \nabla E
$$

In regions of high curvature, gradient descent can become oscillatory. The momentum term helps to reduce these oscillations and smooth the path through weight space, leading to more stable and potentially faster convergence.

```markdown
## Why is the ratio $\lambda_{\min} / \lambda_{\max}$ important, and what issue does it relate to in gradient descent?

The ratio $\lambda_{\min} / \lambda_{\max}$ is important because its reciprocal is the condition number of the Hessian matrix. A small ratio indicates highly elongated elliptical error contours, leading to very slow progress towards the minimum due to significant curvature differences. This issue can be mitigated by incorporating a momentum term into the gradient descent algorithm.

## How does the momentum term affect the gradient descent algorithm according to the image and associated text?

%

The momentum term in the gradient descent algorithm effectively increases the learning rate and smooths the trajectory of the descent towards the minimum of the error function. This leads to more rapid convergence by taking larger and more directed steps, especially in low curvature surfaces, avoiding the smaller steps typical of standard gradient descent.

## Why is progress towards the minimum very slow when the ratio $\lambda_{\min } / \lambda_{\max }$ is very small?

%

When the ratio $\lambda_{\min } / \lambda_{\max }$ is very small, it indicates a highly elongated elliptical error contour. This elongation causes the optimization process to progress extremely slowly towards the minimum since the steps taken in gradient descent are misaligned with the shortest path to the minimum due to the disparity in curvature along different dimensions.

What is the impact of adding a momentum term to the gradient descent algorithm according to the image?

%

The impact of adding a momentum term to the gradient descent algorithm is that it can enable a more rapid descent towards the minimum of the error function by effectively increasing the size of the steps and smoothing out their trajectory. This is particularly beneficial when navigating a valley-like shape of the error surface, as it accelerates the optimization process compared to the standard gradient descent which takes smaller, less directed steps.

Explain the effect of low curvature on gradient descent with a fixed learning rate.

%

With a fixed learning rate parameter, gradient descent down a surface with low curvature leads to successively smaller steps, which correspond to linear convergence. This is because the low curvature results in elongated elliptical error contours, making progress towards the minimum extremely slow. The ratio $\lambda_{\min} / \lambda_{\max}$, where $\lambda_{\min}$ is the smallest eigenvalue, indicates how elongated these contours are. A very small ratio (high condition number of the Hessian) exacerbates this effect.

## What is the effect of a momentum term on the effective value of the learning rate parameter in oscillatory situations in gradient descent?

When successive steps of gradient descent are oscillatory, a momentum term has little influence on the effective value of the learning rate parameter $\eta$. The momentum term tends to cancel out the oscillations and thus the effective learning rate remains close to $\eta$.

## What is the typical value of the momentum parameter $\mu$ in practice, and what range should it fall within?

## How does the inclusion of momentum term affect the convergence in gradient descent?

The inclusion of a momentum term in gradient descent can lead to faster convergence towards the minimum by mitigating divergent oscillations.

## What is the typical approach for determining the learning rate parameter in stochastic gradient descent?

In the stochastic gradient descent learning algorithm, a common approach is to start with a larger value for the learning rate parameter $\eta$ and then reduce it over time. This is often expressed as a function of the step index $\tau$:

$$
\eta = \eta(\tau)
$$

## Write the update rule for Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum.

The update rule for Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum is:

$$

where $\eta$ is the learning rate, $\mu$ is the momentum parameter, and $E_{n:n+B-1}(\mathbf{w})$ is the error function per mini-batch.

## How does the learning rate parameter $\eta$ affect the learning process in stochastic gradient descent?

If the learning rate parameter $\eta$ is very small, learning proceeds slowly. If $\eta$ is too large, it can lead to instability and potentially divergent oscillations. The best practice is to start with a larger $\eta$ and then reduce it over time.

## Describe the linear learning rate schedule and its implications.

The linear learning rate schedule is expressed as follows:

$$
\eta^{(\tau)} = (1 - \tau / K) \eta^{(0)} + (\tau / K) \eta^{(K)}
$$

In this schedule, the learning rate $\eta^{(\tau)}$ reduces linearly over $K$ steps, after which its value is held constant at $\eta^{(K)}$. Adjusting hyperparameters $\eta^{(0)}, \eta^{(K)}, K$ is crucial and must be done empirically. Monitoring the learning curve is crucial to ensure that the error function decreases at a suitable rate during gradient descent.

## Explain the power law learning rate schedule and how it is different from the linear learning rate schedule.

The power law learning rate schedule is given by:

$$
\eta^{(\tau)} = \eta^{(0)} (1 + \tau / s)^{c}
$$

In this schedule, the learning rate $\eta^{(\tau)}$ decreases based on the power $(1 + \tau / s)^{c}$, where the parameters $s$ and $c$ control the decay rate. Unlike the linear schedule where the decay is uniform, the power law schedule allows for more flexible decay patterns based on the choice of $c$. Hyperparameters $\eta^{(0)}, s$, and $c$ must be found empirically.

## What is the exponential decay learning rate schedule? How does it differ from the power law and linear schedules?

The exponential decay learning rate schedule is expressed as:

In this schedule, the learning rate $\eta^{(\tau)}$ decays exponentially, determined by the constant $c$. The decay is more rapid than in power law or linear schedules, as it follows an exponential pattern. Parameters $\eta^{(0)}, c$, and $s$ must be chosen empirically.

AdaGrad adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the accumulated sum of squared gradients. The update rule is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
r_{i}^{(\tau)} & = r_{i}^{(\tau-1)} + \left(\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_{i}}\right)^{2} \\
w_{i}^{(\tau)} & = w_{i}^{(\tau-1)} - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{r_{i}^{(\tau)}} + \delta} \left(\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_{i}}\right) 
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\delta$ is a small constant for numerical stability. This method reduces the learning rate more for parameters associated with high curvature.

- #machine-learning, #optimization.adaptive-methods, #adagrad

## What is the primary problem with the AdaGrad algorithm, and how does RMSProp address this issue?

The AdaGrad algorithm accumulates squared gradients from the start, which can overly reduce the learning rate in later training stages. RMSProp addresses this by replacing the sum of squared gradients with an exponentially weighted average, thus preventing the learning rate from becoming too small as training progresses.

- #machine-learning, #optimization.adaptive-methods, #rmsprop

## Write the AdaGrad update equations and explain the role of each component.

The AdaGrad update equations are as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
r_{i}^{(\tau)} & = r_{i}^{(\tau-1)} + \left(\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_{i}}\right)^{2} \\
w_{i}^{(\tau)} & = w_{i}^{(\tau-1)} - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{r_{i}^{(\tau)}} + \delta} \left(\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_{i}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

- $r_{i}^{(\tau)}$ accumulates the squared gradients for parameter $i$.
- $\eta$ is the learning rate.
- $\delta$ is a small constant to ensure numerical stability.
- $w_{i}^{(\tau)}$ is the updated parameter.

The primary idea is to decrease the learning rate for parameters with a large cumulative gradient to slow down their updates and allow more precise training.

## How is the exponentially weighted moving average of the gradient calculated in Adam optimization method?

The exponentially weighted moving average of the gradient in the Adam optimization method is calculated using the equation:

$$
s_{i}^{(\tau)} = \beta_{1} s_{i}^{(\tau-1)} + (1-\beta_{1}) \left( \frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_{i}} \right)
$$

where:

- $s_{i}^{(\tau)}$ is the exponentially weighted moving average of the gradient at step $\tau$
- $\beta_{1}$ is the hyperparameter that controls the decay rate
- $\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_{i}}$ is the gradient of the loss function $E(\mathbf{w})$ with respect to the parameter $w_{i}$

Typical value for $\beta_{1}$ is $0.9$.

### Card 2
## How is the squared gradient exponentially weighted in Adam optimization method?

The squared gradient is exponentially weighted in the Adam optimization method using:

$$
r_{i}^{(\tau)} = \beta_{2} r_{i}^{(\tau-1)} + (1-\beta_{2})\left(\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_{i}}\right)^2
$$

where:

- $r_{i}^{(\tau)}$ is the exponentially weighted moving average of the squared gradient at step $\tau$
- $\beta_{2}$ is the hyperparameter that controls the decay rate for the squared gradients
- Typical value for $\beta_{2}$ is $0.99$

- #optimizers.adam, #deep-learning.squared-gradients

### Card 3
## Explain the bias correction terms $\frac{1}{(1-\beta_{1}^{\tau})}$ and $\frac{1}{(1-\beta_{2}^{\tau})}$ in the Adam optimization method.

In the Adam optimization method, the bias correction terms $\frac{1}{(1-\beta_{1}^{\tau})}$ and $\frac{1}{(1-\beta_{2}^{\tau})}$ are used to correct for the initialization of $s_{i}^{(0)}$ and $r_{i}^{(0)}$ to zero. These terms address the bias introduced during early iterations. The corrected estimates are:

$$
\widehat{s}_{i}^{(\tau)} = \frac{s_{i}^{(\tau)}}{1 - \beta_{1}^{\tau}}
$$

$$
\widehat{r}_{i}^{\tau} = \frac{r_{i}^{\tau}}{1 - \beta_{2}^{\tau}}
$$

As $\tau$ becomes large, the bias goes to zero since $\beta_{i} < 1$.

- #optimizers.adam, #deep-learning.bias-correction

### Card 4
## What update rule does Adam use for parameter adjustment?

Adam uses the following update rule for parameter adjustment:

$$
w_{i}^{(\tau)} = w_{i}^{(\tau-1)} - \eta \frac{\widehat{s}_{i}^{\tau}}{\sqrt{\widehat{r}_{i}^{\tau}} + \delta}
$$

where:

- $w_{i}^{(\tau)}$ is the updated parameter at step $\tau$
- $\eta$ is the learning rate
- $\widehat{s}_{i}^{\tau}$ is the bias-corrected moving average of the gradient
- $\widehat{r}_{i}^{\tau}$ is the bias-corrected moving average of the squared gradient
- $\delta$ is a small constant to avoid division by zero

- #optimizers.adam, #deep-learning.parameter-update

### Card 5
## What is the typical value of the hyperparameter $\beta_{2}$ in the Adam optimization method and what role does it play?

The typical value of the hyperparameter $\beta_{2}$ in the Adam optimization method is $0.99$. It controls the decay rate for the exponentially weighted moving average of the squared gradients:

$$
r_{i}^{(\tau)} = \beta_{2} r_{i}^{(\tau-1)} + (1-\beta_{2})\left(\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_{i}}\right)^2
$$

The higher the $\beta_{2}$ value, the more weight is given to the past squared gradients.

### Card 6
## What problem does normalization solve in neural networks?

Normalization in neural networks removes the need for the network to handle extremely large or extremely small values of the variables computed during the forward pass. This is crucial for effective training, as it allows the weights and biases to adapt without being destabilized by large gradients. The types of normalization can be across the input data, across mini-batches, or across layers.

## What is the bias correction formula used for the first moment estimate in Adam optimization?

The bias correction formula for the first moment estimate is:

$$
\widehat{\mathbf{s}} = \frac{\mathbf{s}}{1 - \beta_{1}^{\tau}}
$$

Where $\widehat{\mathbf{s}}$ is the bias-corrected estimate, $\beta_1$ is the decay parameter for the first moment, and $\tau$ is the time step.

- #machine-learning, #optimization.adam, #formulas

---

## Explain the role of $\mathbf{r}$ in Adam Optimization algorithm.

In Adam optimization, $\mathbf{r}$ stores an exponentially decaying average of past squared gradients:

$$
\mathbf{r} \leftarrow \beta_{2} \mathbf{r} + \left(1 - \beta_{2}\right) \mathbf{g} \odot \mathbf{g}
$$

Here, $\mathbf{g}$ is the gradient, $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication, and $\beta_{2}$ is the decay parameter.

## How is the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$ updated in the Adam optimization algorithm?

The weight vector $\mathbf{w}$ is updated as follows:

$$
\Delta \mathbf{w} \leftarrow -\eta \frac{\widehat{\mathbf{s}}}{\sqrt{\widehat{\mathbf{r}}} + \delta}
$$

$$
\mathbf{w} \leftarrow \mathbf{w} + \Delta \mathbf{w}
$$

Where $\eta$ is the learning rate, $\widehat{\mathbf{s}}$ and $\widehat{\mathbf{r}}$ are the bias-corrected first and second moment estimates, respectively, $\delta$ is the stabilization parameter.

---

## When does the Adam optimization algorithm shuffle the training data?

The algorithm shuffles the training data when $n+B$ exceeds $N$:

$$
\text{if } n + B > N \text{ then shuffle data} 
$$

This ensures the training process is not biased by the order of data points.

- #machine-learning, #optimization.adam, #training-data

---

## Describe the purpose of data normalization in the context of gradient descent training.

Data normalization is important in gradient descent training because it helps to ensure that input variables span similar ranges. Without normalization, different input variables can have vastly different ranges, which can cause the training process to be inefficient or even problematic. This is due to the error surface having very different curvatures along different axes, making optimization harder.

## Provide the formulas for calculating the mean $\mu_i$ and variance $\sigma_i^2$ for data normalization.

The mean and variance for a continuous input variable \( x \) can be calculated using the following formulas:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mu_{i} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n i} \\
& \sigma_{i}^{2} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( x_{n i} - \mu_{i} \right)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Explain how input values are re-scaled during data normalization, and provide the formula used.

After calculating the mean and variance, input values are re-scaled to have zero mean and unit variance using the following formula:

$$
\widetilde{x}_{n i} = \frac{x_{n i} - \mu_{i}}{\sigma_{i}}
$$

This transformation ensures that all input values have the same scale, which helps in the gradient descent optimization process.

- .data-preprocessing, .normalization, .gradient-descent

---

## What must be ensured when pre-processing development, validation, or test data in data normalization?

When pre-processing development, validation, or test data, it is crucial to use the same values of $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i$ that were used for the training data. This ensures that all inputs are scaled consistently and that the model performs correctly on these additional data sets.

- .machine-learning, .data-preprocessing, .consistency

## Calculate the mean $\mu_i$ and variance $\sigma_i^2$ if the input data $x_{ni}$ consists of the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

First, calculate the mean $\mu_i$:

$$
\mu_i = \frac{1}{5} \sum_{n=1}^{5} x_{n i} = \frac{1}{5} (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) = \frac{15}{5} = 3
$$

Next, calculate the variance $\sigma_i^2$:

$$
\sigma_i^2 = \frac{1}{5} \sum_{n=1}^{5} (x_{n i} - \mu_i)^2 = \frac{1}{5} ((1-3)^2 + (2-3)^2 + (3-3)^2 + (4-3)^2 + (5-3)^2) = \frac{1}{5} (4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4) = \frac{10}{5} = 2
$$

## Normalize the data values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 using the mean and variance calculated previously.

Use the mean $ \mu_i = 3 $ and variance $ \sigma_i^2 = 2 $, thus the standard deviation $ \sigma_i = \sqrt{2} $. The normalized values are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\widetilde{x}_{1} = \frac{1 - 3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{2}} = -\sqrt{2} \\
&\widetilde{x}_{2} = \frac{2 - 3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&\widetilde{x}_{3} = \frac{3 - 3}{\sqrt{2}} = 0 \\
&\widetilde{x}_{4} = \frac{4 - 3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&\widetilde{x}_{5} = \frac{5 - 3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}

## Explain the motivation for using batch normalization in training deep neural networks.

Batch normalization addresses the vanishing and exploding gradient problems, which arise during training very deep neural networks. This problem can be understood through the gradient of an error function $E$ with respect to a parameter in the first layer of the network:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{i}}=\sum_{m} \cdots \sum_{l} \sum_{j} \frac{\partial z_{m}^{(1)}}{\partial w_{i}} \cdots \frac{\partial z_{j}^{(K)}}{\partial z_{l}^{(K-1)}} \frac{\partial E}{\partial z_{j}^{(K)}}
$$

where $z_{j}^{(k)}$ denotes the activation of node $j$ in layer $k$. Batch normalization helps to stabilize this gradient and improve learning.

```

```markdown
## Describe the procedure of normalizing pre-activations in batch normalization.

In batch normalization, pre-activations $a_i$ are normalized. For a mini-batch of size $K$, the procedure involves:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_{i} & =\frac{1}{K} \sum_{n=1}^{K} a_{n i} \\
\sigma_{i}^{2} & =\frac{1}{K} \sum_{n=1}^{K}\left(a_{n i}-\mu_{i}\right)^{2} \\
\widehat{a}_{n i} & =\frac{a_{n i}-\mu_{i}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{i}^{2}+\delta}}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\mu_i$ is the mean, $\sigma_i^2$ is the variance, and $\delta$ is a small constant to avoid division by zero.

```

```markdown
## What happens to the gradient of an error function when the activation values in a hidden layer vary widely, and how does batch normalization address this?

When activation values in a hidden layer vary widely, the product of the Jacobian terms tends to zero if most have magnitude $<1$ or to infinity if most have magnitude $>1$. This leads to vanishing or exploding gradients:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{i}}=\sum_{m} \cdots \sum_{l} \sum_{j} \frac{\partial z_{m}^{(1)}}{\partial w_{i}} \cdots \frac{\partial z_{j}^{(K)}}{\partial z_{l}^{(K-1)}} \frac{\partial E}{\partial z_{j}^{(K)}}
$$

Batch normalization addresses this by normalizing activation values to have zero mean and unit variance, stabilizing the gradient.

## Define the terms $\mu_i$, $\sigma_i^2$, and $\widehat{a}_{n i}$ in the context of batch normalization.

In batch normalization, for a mini-batch of size $K$, the terms are defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_{i} & = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{n=1}^{K} a_{n i} \quad \text{(mean)} \\
\sigma_{i}^{2} & = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{n=1}^{K} \left(a_{n i} - \mu_{i}\right)^{2} \quad \text{(variance)} \\
\widehat{a}_{n i} & = \frac{a_{n i} - \mu_{i}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{i}^{2} + \delta}} \quad \text{(normalized activation)}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $a_{n i}$ is the pre-activation value and $\delta$ is a small constant.

```markdown
## In batch normalization, how often must the normalization of hidden unit values be repeated during training?

Unlike normalization of the input values, which can be done once prior to the start of training, normalization of the hidden unit values must be repeated during training every time the weight values are updated. This is to ensure that the values are always appropriately scaled during the entire training process.

## Why is a small constant $\delta$ included in the denominator of the normalized activation equation in batch normalization?

The small constant $\delta$ in the equation

$$
\widehat{a}_{n i} = \frac{a_{n i} - \mu_{i}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{i}^{2} + \delta}}
$$

is included to avoid numerical issues in situations where the variance $\sigma_{i}^{2}$ is very small, thereby preventing division by zero or extremely large values.

## What is the mathematical expression for the change in the error function when making a small step in weight space from $\mathbf{w}$ to $\mathbf{w}+\delta \mathbf{w}$?

$$
\delta E \simeq \delta \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \nabla E(\mathbf{w})
$$

- #neural-networks.gradient-descent, #optimization.error-function

## In the context of neural networks, explain the significance of the condition $\nabla E(\mathbf{w})=0$ in weight space.

The condition $\nabla E(\mathbf{w})=0$ signifies a stationary point in weight space, which can be a local minimum, maximum, or saddle point. This implies that the gradient of the error function vanishes, meaning that making small steps in any direction will not change the error function value significantly.

- #neural-networks.optimization, #mathematical-concepts.stationary-points

## What is the role of the vector $\nabla E(\mathbf{w})$ in the optimization of the neural network error function?

The vector $\nabla E(\mathbf{w})$ points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the error function $E(\mathbf{w})$. By taking steps in the direction of $-\nabla E(\mathbf{w})$, one can reduce the error function value, thereby optimizing the parameters $\mathbf{w}$.

- #neural-networks.optimization, #vector-calculus.gradient

## Define the purpose of backpropagation in the context of optimizing the error function in a neural network.

Backpropagation is a technique used to evaluate the required derivatives of the error function with respect to each of the parameters in the network efficiently. It involves computations that flow backwards through the network, analogous to the forward flow of function computations during the evaluation of the network outputs.

- #neural-networks.backpropagation, #optimization.technical-methods

## How does the dimension of the weight space in modern deep learning differ from classical statistics, and what goal does this serve?

Modern deep learning typically works with rich models containing a huge number of learnable parameters, far exceeding the number of data points. The goal is not exact optimization but achieving good generalization on test data, facilitated by the properties and behavior of the learning algorithm along with regularization methods.

- #deep-learning.parameters, #statistics.model-fits

## Explain the concept of an error surface in weight space and its importance in training a neural network.

The error function can be visualized as a surface sitting over ‘weight space’. During training, the objective is to navigate this surface to find the optimal values for the weights and biases, which minimizes the error function and allows the neural network to make effective predictions.

## Describe the basic transformation used in batch normalization, including the relevant parameters.

The transformation used in batch normalization is given by:

$$
\widetilde{a}_{ni} = \gamma_i \widehat{a}_{ni} + \beta_i
$$

where $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$ are adaptive parameters that are learned by gradient descent alongside the weights and biases of the network.

- #machine-learning, #neural-networks.batch-normalization

---

## Explain the role of adaptive parameters $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$ in batch normalization.

Adaptive parameters $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$ in batch normalization serve to rescale and shift the normalized activations. These parameters are learned during training, typically through gradient descent, and allow the network to restore its representational power after normalization.

$$
\widetilde{a}_{ni} = \gamma_i \widehat{a}_{ni} + \beta_i
$$

- #machine-learning, #neural-networks.batch-normalization

---

## What is the key difference between normalizing input data and the transformation in batch normalization in terms of learning?

The key difference between normalizing input data and the transformation in batch normalization is that, in batch normalization, the mean and variance are learned parameters ($\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$) that evolve independently during training. This makes them easier to learn during gradient descent, unlike the complex function of weights and biases in the original network.

$$
\widetilde{a}_{ni} = \gamma_i \widehat{a}_{ni} + \beta_i
$$

- #machine-learning, #neural-networks.batch-normalization

---

## Why might it appear that the transformation $\widetilde{a}_{ni} = \gamma_i \widehat{a}_{ni} + \beta_i$ undoes the effect of batch normalization? 

It might appear that the transformation undoes the effect of batch normalization because the mean and variance can adapt to arbitrary values again. However, the mean and variance are now controlled by the learnable parameters $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$, which are much easier to learn during gradient descent.

- #machine-learning, #neural-networks.batch-normalization

---

## How does the batch normalization layer fit into the structure of a neural network?

Batch normalization can be viewed as an additional layer that follows each standard hidden layer in the neural network. This allows for differentiable transformation of variables with respect to the learnable parameters $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$.

$$
\widetilde{a}_{ni} = \gamma_i \widehat{a}_{ni} + \beta_i
$$

- #machine-learning, #neural-networks.batch-normalization-layers

---

## When making predictions on new data, describe any modification to the batch normalization process post-training.

Once the network is trained, the parameters $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$, learned during training, are used directly for making predictions on new data without modification. This ensures consistent rescaling and shifting based on the learned parameters.

### Card 1

## How are moving averages for mean and variance computed in the training phase in the context of batch normalization?

The moving averages for mean, $\mu_{i}$, and variance, $\sigma_{i}^{2}$, during the training phase in batch normalization are computed as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \bar{\mu}_{i}^{(\tau)}=\alpha \bar{\mu}_{i}^{(\tau-1)}+(1-\alpha) \mu_{i} \\
& \bar{\sigma}_{i}^{(\tau)}=\alpha \bar{\sigma}_{i}^{(\tau-1)}+(1-\alpha) \sigma_{i}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $0 \leqslant \alpha \leqslant 1$.

These moving averages play no role during training but are used to process new data points during the inference phase.

### Card 2

## Explain the motivation behind batch normalization and discuss why it might be effective in practice.

Batch normalization was originally motivated by noting that updates to weights in earlier layers of the network change the distribution of values seen by later layers, a phenomenon called internal covariate shift. This involves normalizing the inputs of each layer.

However, later studies (Santurkar et al., 2018) suggest that batch normalization improves training not because it addresses covariate shift, but because it improves the smoothness of the error function landscape.

- #neural-networks, #batch-normalization, #training

### Card 3

## What are some limitations of batch normalization, and how does layer normalization address these limitations?

With batch normalization, if the batch size is too small, the estimates of mean and variance become too noisy. Additionally, for very large training sets, minibatches may be split across different GPUs, rendering global normalization across the minibatch inefficient.

Layer normalization addresses these limitations by normalizing across the hidden-unit values for each data point separately, rather than across the batch:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_{n} & =\frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} a_{n i} \\
\sigma_{n}^{2} & =\frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(a_{n i}-\mu_{n}\right)^{2} \\
\widehat{a}_{n i} & =\frac{a_{n i}-\mu_{n}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{n}^{2}+\delta}}

### Card 4

## Provide the equations for the mean ($\mu_{n}$) and variance ($\sigma_{n}^{2}$) under layer normalization.

Under layer normalization, the mean $\mu_{n}$ and variance $\sigma_{n}^{2}$ for each data point are computed as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_{n} & =\frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} a_{n i} \\
\sigma_{n}^{2} & =\frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(a_{n i}-\mu_{n}\right)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Where $i = 1, \ldots, M$ represents all hidden units in the layer.

### Card 5

## How does layer normalization normalize the hidden-unit values for each data point?

Layer normalization normalizes the hidden-unit values for each data point by using the following transformation:

$$
\widehat{a}_{n i} =\frac{a_{n i}-\mu_{n}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{n}^{2}+\delta}}
$$

where $\mu_{n}$ and $\sigma_{n}^{2}$ are the mean and variance of the hidden unit values for the data point.

### Card 6

## In the context of neural networks, what flexibility do trainable parameters introduce during normalization?

Both batch normalization and layer normalization allow for additional learnable mean ($\beta$) and standard deviation ($\gamma$) parameters to be introduced for each hidden unit separately. This adds flexibility to the normalization process, enabling the model to shift and scale the normalized values appropriately:

$$
\hat{a}'_{n i} = \gamma \widehat{a}_{n i} + \beta
$$

This modified normalization function is employed both during training and inference.

## Consider a Hessian matrix $\mathbf{H}$ with the eigenvector equation (7.8). By setting the vector $\mathbf{v}$ in (7.14) equal to each of the eigenvectors $\mathbf{u}_{i}$ in turn, show that $\mathbf{H}$ is positive definite if, and only if, all its eigenvalues are positive.

The Hessian matrix $\mathbf{H}$ is positive definite if, and only if, all its eigenvalues are positive.




```math
While we're on the topic: The eigenvalue equation of a Hessian matrix is fundamental in optimization and can be written as:
\[
\mathbf{H} \mathbf{u} = \lambda \mathbf{u}
\]
Where $\mathbf{H}$ is the Hessian matrix, $\mathbf{u}$ is the eigenvector, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue.
\]
A matrix $\mathbf{H}$ is positive definite if for all non-zero vectors $\mathbf{z}$, we have:
\[
\mathbf{z}^{T} \mathbf{H} \mathbf{z} > 0
]
To show the implications for eigenvalues,

If $\mathbf{H}$ is positive definite, $\mathbf{z}^{T} \mathbf{H} \mathbf{z} > 0$. Consider $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{u}_i$.

Then,
\[
\mathbf{u}_i^{T} \mathbf{H} \mathbf{u}_i = \mathbf{u}_i^{T} \lambda_i \mathbf{u}_i = \lambda_i (\mathbf{u}_i^{T} \mathbf{u}_i)
\]

Since $\mathbf{u}_i^{T} \mathbf{u}_i > 0$, it follows that:
\[
\lambda_i (\mathbf{u}_i^{T} \mathbf{u}_i) > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda_i > 0
This proves all eigenvalues must be positive.

$y(x,w,b) = wx + b$ together with a sum-of-squares error function given by 

$$
E(w, b)=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{y\left(x_{n}, w, b\right)-t_{n}\right\}^{2}
$$

Derive expressions for the elements of the $2 \times 2$ Hessian matrix given by the second derivatives of the error function with respect to the weight parameter $w$ and bias parameter $b$. Show that the trace and its determinant of this Hessian are both positive. Since the trace represents the sum of the eigenvalue and the determinant corresponds to the product of the eigenvalues, then both eigenvalues are positive and hence the stationary point of the error function is a minimum.

### Partial derivatices of y function

first derivative w.r.t bias, $\frac{\partial b}$:
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial b}E(w, b)=\frac{1}{2}\sum\mathbb{N}_{1}2\left \{wx_{n} -b -t_{n}\right\} . 1

Implementing second order functions,
$$
\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial w^{2}}E(w, b)=\sum\mathbb{N}\frac{n=1} x_{n}\left((x_{n)^{2}E(w,b) - t_{0}t_{1}}

$$

Finally, we form the Hessian matrix,

$$
\mathbf{H} = \begin{bmatrix}

The trace in diagIainal form trace(H)= H_{11}+H_{22} is given by;

$$
$\mathbf{p}{H}=trace[1,1]+H_{22}

## Why is it challenging to find a global minimum in the error function $E(\mathbf{w})$?

The error function $E(\mathbf{w})$ typically has a highly nonlinear dependence on the weights and biases, leading to many local minima where the gradient vanishes. This complexity makes it challenging to find the global minimum.

## Describe a scenario where local minima are encountered in weight space for a neural network.

### Card 1

## Why is using gradient information advantageous in training neural networks?

Using gradient information is advantageous because it significantly reduces the computational effort required to find the minimum of the error function. Each evaluation of the gradient $\nabla E$ brings $W$ pieces of information, where $W$ is the number of learnable parameters. Therefore, we might hope to find the minimum in $\mathcal{O}(W)$ gradient evaluations. Each evaluation takes $\mathcal{O}(W)$ steps, so the minimum can be found in $\mathcal{O}(W^2)$ steps, which is more efficient compared to $\mathcal{O}(W^3)$ steps required without using gradient information.

## What is the relation between the quadratic approximation error surface and the number of parameters $W$ in a neural network?

The error surface in the quadratic approximation to the error function is specified by the quantities $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{H}$, which contain a total of $\frac{W(W+3)}{2}$ independent elements because the matrix $\mathbf{H}$ is symmetric. The minimum location depends on $\mathcal{O}(W^2)$ parameters. Without gradient information, $\mathcal{O}(W^2)$ function evaluations, each requiring $\mathcal{O}(W)$ steps, are needed. Hence, the computational effort is $\mathcal{O}(W^3)$.

where $\eta$ is the learning rate. After each update, the gradient is re-evaluated for the new weight vector $\mathbf{w}^{(\tau+1)}$, and the process is repeated. The weight vector is moved in the direction of the greatest rate of decrease of the error function.

## How does the computational effort of finding the minimum error differ between using gradient information and not using it?

Without gradient information, the computational effort to find the minimum error of the function is $\mathcal{O}(W^3)$. Using gradient information, the computational effort is reduced to $\mathcal{O}(W^2)$. This is primarily because each gradient evaluation brings $W$ pieces of information and takes $\mathcal{O}(W)$ steps, leading to more efficient minimization.

## Define the term "learning rate" in the context of gradient descent.

## What is the basic update rule in Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)?

The update rule for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is given by:

$$
\mathbf{w}^{(\tau)}=\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}-\eta \nabla E_{n}\left(\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}\right)
$$

where $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector, $\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\nabla E_{n}\left(\mathbf{w}\right)$ is the gradient of the error function with respect to the current data point $n$.

## Explain the advantage of SGD in terms of handling redundancy in data.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) handles redundancy in data efficiently. If a dataset is doubled by duplicating every data point, this multiplies the error function by a factor of 2:

$$
E(\mathbf{w})=\sum_{n=1}^{N} E_{n}(\mathbf{w})
$$

Batch methods would require double the computational effort to evaluate the gradient, whereas SGD processes each data point individually and is unaffected by this redundancy.

## Describe the concept of a 'training epoch' in the context of SGD.

A 'training epoch' in the context of SGD refers to a complete pass through the entire training set. During each epoch, the weight vector is updated based on each data point sequentially:

$$
\mathbf{w}^{(\tau)}=\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}-\eta \nabla E_{n}\left(\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}\right)
$$

Cycling through all data points once constitutes one epoch.

## What is the initial step in Algorithm 7.1: Stochastic Gradient Descent?

The initial step in Algorithm 7.1 is to set $n \leftarrow 1$, where $n$ indexes the data points. The algorithm then starts updating the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$ based on one data point at a time.

---

## What role does the learning rate $\eta$ play in the SGD update rule?

The learning rate $\eta$ controls the step size of the updates made to the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$. It's crucial for ensuring that the updates neither overshoot (too large $\eta$) nor converge too slowly (too small $\eta$).

$$
\mathbf{w}^{(\tau)}=\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}-\eta \nabla E_{n}\left(\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}\right)
$$

- #machine-learning.learning-rate, #algorithms.gradient-descent

## How does SGD help in escaping local minima in the optimization process?

SGD helps in escaping local minima because the updates are based on individual data points, not the entire dataset. A stationary point for the whole dataset is not necessarily a stationary point for each individual data point, allowing SGD to potentially escape from local minima.

where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the distribution generating the data. Increasing the mini-batch size by a factor of 100 reduces the error only by a factor of 10, indicating diminishing returns.

## Why should mini-batch data points be chosen randomly in stochastic gradient descent?

Mini-batch data points should be chosen randomly to avoid correlations between successive data points which can arise from the way the data was collected (e.g., alphabetically or by date). This is handled by shuffling the data set and drawing mini-batches as successive blocks to escape local minima.

## What is the downside of using stochastic gradient descent with a single data point?

The gradient of the error function computed from a single data point provides a very noisy estimate of the gradient computed on the full data set. This noise can lead to inefficiencies in the convergence of the optimization process.

## How does hardware architecture influence the choice of mini-batch size in stochastic gradient descent?

Hardware architecture can influence the choice of mini-batch size. For example, on some hardware platforms, mini-batch sizes that are powers of 2 (e.g., 64, 128, 256) work well due to the architecture's specific optimizations and efficient execution of such sizes.

## What are the common distributions used for initializing weights in gradient descent, and why is the choice of $\epsilon$ important?

Weights are often initialized using either:
1. A uniform distribution in the range $[-ε, ε]$, or
2. A zero-mean Gaussian of the form $\mathcal{N}(0, ε^2)$.

The choice of $ε$ is important for effective training. Widely used approaches like He initialization help in choosing appropriate $ε$.

## Why is symmetry breaking important in the initialization of parameters for gradient descent?

Symmetry breaking is important because if parameters are initialized with the same value (e.g., all set to zero), their updates will be the same, leading redundant units that compute the same function. Random initialization from some distribution ensures diverse updating and breaks this symmetry.

## Describe the weight vector update in mini-batch stochastic gradient descent.

The weight vector is updated using the gradient of the error function over a mini-batch in mini-batch stochastic gradient descent.

$$
\mathbf{w} \leftarrow \mathbf{w} - \eta \nabla E_{n: n+B-1}(\mathbf{w})
$$

## What is the role of ReLU activation function in the transformation within layer $l$?

The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function ensures that any negative inputs are zeroed out while positive inputs remain unchanged.

$$
z_{i}^{(l)} = \operatorname{ReLU}(a_{i}^{(l)})
$$

## What are the initial conditions for weights when using a Gaussian distribution in the context of Algorithm 7.2?

The weights are initialized using a Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\epsilon^2$.

$$
\mathcal{N}(0, \epsilon^2)
$$

## Calculate the variance of the unit outputs $z_i$ in layer $l$ when using a ReLU activation function with Gaussian initialization.

The variance of the unit outputs in layer $l$ is:

$$
\operatorname{var}[z_i^{(l)}] = \frac{M}{2} \epsilon^2 \lambda^2
$$

where $M$ is the number of units sending connections, $\epsilon^2$ is the variance of the Gaussian initialization, and $\lambda^2$ is the variance of the outputs in the previous layer.

## Explain the importance of ensuring the variance of pre-activations does not decay to zero or grow significantly across layers.

To maintain stable training, the variance of pre-activations should be consistent across layers; otherwise, gradients may vanish or explode, leading to training instability.

$$
\operatorname{var}[z_i^{(l)}] = \frac{M}{2} \epsilon^2 \lambda^2
$$

## Derive the expected value of pre-activations $a_i$ in layer $l$ when initialized with a Gaussian distribution.

Given:

$$
a_{i}^{(l)} = \sum_{j=1}^{M} w_{i j} z_{j}^{(l-1)}
$$

The expected value is:

$$
\mathbb{E}[a_i^{(l)}] = 0
$$

since weights $w_{ij}$ are initialized with $\mathcal{N}(0, \epsilon^2)$ and $z_{j}^{(l-1)}$ has zero mean.
