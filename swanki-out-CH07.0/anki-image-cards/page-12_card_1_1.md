The momentum term in the gradient descent algorithm effectively increases the learning rate and smooths the trajectory of the descent towards the minimum of the error function. This leads to more rapid convergence by taking larger and more directed steps, especially in low curvature surfaces, avoiding the smaller steps typical of standard gradient descent.

## Why is progress towards the minimum very slow when the ratio $\lambda_{\min } / \lambda_{\max }$ is very small?

When the ratio $\lambda_{\min } / \lambda_{\max }$ is very small, it indicates a highly elongated elliptical error contour. This elongation causes the optimization process to progress extremely slowly towards the minimum since the steps taken in gradient descent are misaligned with the shortest path to the minimum due to the disparity in curvature along different dimensions.
