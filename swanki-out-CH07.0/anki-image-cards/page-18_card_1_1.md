The image illustrates the effect of input data normalization on a data set with two variables. The red circles represent the original data points, while the blue crosses represent the data points after normalization. The normalization process adjusts the data such that each variable now has zero mean and unit variance.

## What is the effect of normalizing the input data in a data set with two variables as shown in Figure 7.7?

Normalization adjusts the data so that each variable has a zero mean and unit variance across the data set. This is depicted by the transformation from the red circles (original data) to the blue crosses (normalized data), centering the data around the origin of the graph.
