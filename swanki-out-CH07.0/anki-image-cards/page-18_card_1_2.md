### Card 1

How does the normalization process affect the dataset shown in Figure 7.7?

Normalization adjusts the dataset such that each variable has zero mean and unit variance. In the figure, this is illustrated by the transition from red circles (original data points) to blue crosses (normalized data points). The normalization aligns the data points to a common scale, centered around the origin of the graph.

### Card 2

What do the red circles and blue crosses in Figure 7.7 represent?

The red circles represent the original data points for a dataset with two variables. The blue crosses represent the same data points after normalization, where each variable has been adjusted to have zero mean and unit variance across the dataset.
