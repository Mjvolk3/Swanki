## What is the mathematical expression for the change in the error function when making a small step in weight space from $\mathbf{w}$ to $\mathbf{w}+\delta \mathbf{w}$?

$$
\delta E \simeq \delta \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{T}} \nabla E(\mathbf{w})
$$

## In the context of neural networks, explain the significance of the condition $\nabla E(\mathbf{w})=0$ in weight space.

The condition $\nabla E(\mathbf{w})=0$ signifies a stationary point in weight space, which can be a local minimum, maximum, or saddle point. This implies that the gradient of the error function vanishes, meaning that making small steps in any direction will not change the error function value significantly.

## What is the role of the vector $\nabla E(\mathbf{w})$ in the optimization of the neural network error function?

The vector $\nabla E(\mathbf{w})$ points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the error function $E(\mathbf{w})$. By taking steps in the direction of $-\nabla E(\mathbf{w})$, one can reduce the error function value, thereby optimizing the parameters $\mathbf{w}$.

## Define the purpose of backpropagation in the context of optimizing the error function in a neural network.

Backpropagation is a technique used to evaluate the required derivatives of the error function with respect to each of the parameters in the network efficiently. It involves computations that flow backwards through the network, analogous to the forward flow of function computations during the evaluation of the network outputs.

## How does the dimension of the weight space in modern deep learning differ from classical statistics, and what goal does this serve?

Modern deep learning typically works with rich models containing a huge number of learnable parameters, far exceeding the number of data points. The goal is not exact optimization but achieving good generalization on test data, facilitated by the properties and behavior of the learning algorithm along with regularization methods.

## Explain the concept of an error surface in weight space and its importance in training a neural network.

The error function can be visualized as a surface sitting over ‘weight space’. During training, the objective is to navigate this surface to find the optimal values for the weights and biases, which minimizes the error function and allows the neural network to make effective predictions.
