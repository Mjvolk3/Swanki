## Explain how an arbitrary vector $\mathbf{v}$ can be expressed using eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix. Provide the related equation.

Arbitrary vector $\mathbf{v}$ can be expressed using eigenvectors $\left\{\mathbf{u}_{i}\right\}$ of the Hessian matrix $\mathbf{H}$ as follows:

$$
\mathbf{v}=\sum_{i} c_{i} \mathbf{u}_{i}
$$

where $c_i$ are the coefficients associated with each eigenvector $\mathbf{u}_i$.

## Write the equation that relates $\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{H} \mathbf{v}$ to the eigenvalues $\lambda_{i}$ and coefficients $c_i$ in the context of the Hessian matrix $\mathbf{H}$.

Given an arbitrary vector $\mathbf{v}$, the relationship between $\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{H} \mathbf{v}$, the eigenvalues $\lambda_{i}$, and coefficients $c_i$ is:

$$
\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{H} \mathbf{v} = \sum_{i} c_{i}^{2} \lambda_{i}
$$

This demonstrates how the quadratic form $\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{H} \mathbf{v}$ depends on the eigenvalues and the corresponding coefficients.

## State the necessary and sufficient condition for a weight vector $\mathbf{w}^{\star}$ to be a local minimum based on the Hessian matrix and the gradient of the error function.

A necessary and sufficient condition for $\mathbf{w}^{\star}$ to be a local minimum is that the gradient of the error function $\nabla E(\mathbf{w})$ should vanish at $\mathbf{w}^{\star}$, and the Hessian matrix $\mathbf{H}$ evaluated at $\mathbf{w}^{\star}$ should be positive definite.

## Explain why the contours of constant error $E(\mathbf{w})$ are ellipses and how they are aligned in the new coordinate system given by eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix.

In the new coordinate system, whose basis vectors are the eigenvectors $\left\{\mathbf{u}_{i}\right\}$ of the Hessian matrix, the contours of constant error $E(\mathbf{w})$ become axis-aligned ellipses centered on the origin. This is because the Hessian matrix defines a quadratic form, resulting in elliptical contours whose axes align with the eigenvectors.

## Given the gradient descent equation $\mathbf{w}^{(\tau)}=\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}+\Delta \mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}$, describe what the symbol $\tau$ represents and the significance in the context of optimization.

In the gradient descent equation $\mathbf{w}^{(\tau)}=\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}+\Delta \mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}$, the symbol $\tau$ represents the iteration step. This iterative method continues until convergence to minimize the error function. Each step updates the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$.

## Discuss why an analytical solution to $\nabla E(\mathbf{w})=0$ is unlikely for complex error functions in neural networks and why iterative numerical procedures are used instead.

For complex error functions, such as those defined by neural networks, finding an analytical solution to $\nabla E(\mathbf{w})=0$ is highly impractical due to the nonlinearity and high dimensionality of the parameter space. Therefore, iterative numerical procedures like gradient descent are used to approximate the solution.
