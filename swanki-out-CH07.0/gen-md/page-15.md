## Describe the linear learning rate schedule and its implications.

The linear learning rate schedule is expressed as follows:

$$
\eta^{(\tau)} = (1 - \tau / K) \eta^{(0)} + (\tau / K) \eta^{(K)}
$$

In this schedule, the learning rate $\eta^{(\tau)}$ reduces linearly over $K$ steps, after which its value is held constant at $\eta^{(K)}$. Adjusting hyperparameters $\eta^{(0)}, \eta^{(K)}, K$ is crucial and must be done empirically. Monitoring the learning curve is crucial to ensure that the error function decreases at a suitable rate during gradient descent.

## Explain the power law learning rate schedule and how it is different from the linear learning rate schedule.

The power law learning rate schedule is given by:

$$
\eta^{(\tau)} = \eta^{(0)} (1 + \tau / s)^{c}
$$

In this schedule, the learning rate $\eta^{(\tau)}$ decreases based on the power $(1 + \tau / s)^{c}$, where the parameters $s$ and $c$ control the decay rate. Unlike the linear schedule where the decay is uniform, the power law schedule allows for more flexible decay patterns based on the choice of $c$. Hyperparameters $\eta^{(0)}, s$, and $c$ must be found empirically.

## What is the exponential decay learning rate schedule? How does it differ from the power law and linear schedules?

The exponential decay learning rate schedule is expressed as:

$$
\eta^{(\tau)} = \eta^{(0)} c^{\tau / s}
$$

In this schedule, the learning rate $\eta^{(\tau)}$ decays exponentially, determined by the constant $c$. The decay is more rapid than in power law or linear schedules, as it follows an exponential pattern. Parameters $\eta^{(0)}, c$, and $s$ must be chosen empirically.

## Describe the key idea behind the AdaGrad algorithm. How does it adapt the learning rate?

AdaGrad adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the accumulated sum of squared gradients. The update rule is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
r_{i}^{(\tau)} & = r_{i}^{(\tau-1)} + \left(\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_{i}}\right)^{2} \\
w_{i}^{(\tau)} & = w_{i}^{(\tau-1)} - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{r_{i}^{(\tau)}} + \delta} \left(\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_{i}}\right) 
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\delta$ is a small constant for numerical stability. This method reduces the learning rate more for parameters associated with high curvature.

## What is the primary problem with the AdaGrad algorithm, and how does RMSProp address this issue?

The AdaGrad algorithm accumulates squared gradients from the start, which can overly reduce the learning rate in later training stages. RMSProp addresses this by replacing the sum of squared gradients with an exponentially weighted average, thus preventing the learning rate from becoming too small as training progresses.

## Write the AdaGrad update equations and explain the role of each component.

The AdaGrad update equations are as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
r_{i}^{(\tau)} & = r_{i}^{(\tau-1)} + \left(\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_{i}}\right)^{2} \\
w_{i}^{(\tau)} & = w_{i}^{(\tau-1)} - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{r_{i}^{(\tau)}} + \delta} \left(\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_{i}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

- $r_{i}^{(\tau)}$ accumulates the squared gradients for parameter $i$.
- $\eta$ is the learning rate.
- $\delta$ is a small constant to ensure numerical stability.
- $w_{i}^{(\tau)}$ is the updated parameter.

The primary idea is to decrease the learning rate for parameters with a large cumulative gradient to slow down their updates and allow more precise training.
