## What is the basic update rule in Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)?

The update rule for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is given by:

$$
\mathbf{w}^{(\tau)}=\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}-\eta \nabla E_{n}\left(\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}\right)
$$

where $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector, $\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\nabla E_{n}\left(\mathbf{w}\right)$ is the gradient of the error function with respect to the current data point $n$.

## Explain the advantage of SGD in terms of handling redundancy in data.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) handles redundancy in data efficiently. If a dataset is doubled by duplicating every data point, this multiplies the error function by a factor of 2:

$$
E(\mathbf{w})=\sum_{n=1}^{N} E_{n}(\mathbf{w})
$$

Batch methods would require double the computational effort to evaluate the gradient, whereas SGD processes each data point individually and is unaffected by this redundancy.

## Describe the concept of a 'training epoch' in the context of SGD.

A 'training epoch' in the context of SGD refers to a complete pass through the entire training set. During each epoch, the weight vector is updated based on each data point sequentially:

$$
\mathbf{w}^{(\tau)}=\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}-\eta \nabla E_{n}\left(\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}\right)
$$

Cycling through all data points once constitutes one epoch.

## What is the initial step in Algorithm 7.1: Stochastic Gradient Descent?

The initial step in Algorithm 7.1 is to set $n \leftarrow 1$, where $n$ indexes the data points. The algorithm then starts updating the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$ based on one data point at a time.

## What role does the learning rate $\eta$ play in the SGD update rule?

The learning rate $\eta$ controls the step size of the updates made to the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$. It's crucial for ensuring that the updates neither overshoot (too large $\eta$) nor converge too slowly (too small $\eta$).

$$
\mathbf{w}^{(\tau)}=\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}-\eta \nabla E_{n}\left(\mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)}\right)
$$

## How does SGD help in escaping local minima in the optimization process?

SGD helps in escaping local minima because the updates are based on individual data points, not the entire dataset. A stationary point for the whole dataset is not necessarily a stationary point for each individual data point, allowing SGD to potentially escape from local minima.
