## Describe the basic transformation used in batch normalization, including the relevant parameters.

The transformation used in batch normalization is given by:

$$
\widetilde{a}_{ni} = \gamma_i \widehat{a}_{ni} + \beta_i
$$

where $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$ are adaptive parameters that are learned by gradient descent alongside the weights and biases of the network.

## Explain the role of adaptive parameters $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$ in batch normalization.

Adaptive parameters $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$ in batch normalization serve to rescale and shift the normalized activations. These parameters are learned during training, typically through gradient descent, and allow the network to restore its representational power after normalization.

$$
\widetilde{a}_{ni} = \gamma_i \widehat{a}_{ni} + \beta_i
$$

## What is the key difference between normalizing input data and the transformation in batch normalization in terms of learning?

The key difference between normalizing input data and the transformation in batch normalization is that, in batch normalization, the mean and variance are learned parameters ($\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$) that evolve independently during training. This makes them easier to learn during gradient descent, unlike the complex function of weights and biases in the original network.

$$
\widetilde{a}_{ni} = \gamma_i \widehat{a}_{ni} + \beta_i
$$

## Why might it appear that the transformation $\widetilde{a}_{ni} = \gamma_i \widehat{a}_{ni} + \beta_i$ undoes the effect of batch normalization? 

It might appear that the transformation undoes the effect of batch normalization because the mean and variance can adapt to arbitrary values again. However, the mean and variance are now controlled by the learnable parameters $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$, which are much easier to learn during gradient descent.

## How does the batch normalization layer fit into the structure of a neural network?

Batch normalization can be viewed as an additional layer that follows each standard hidden layer in the neural network. This allows for differentiable transformation of variables with respect to the learnable parameters $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$.

$$
\widetilde{a}_{ni} = \gamma_i \widehat{a}_{ni} + \beta_i
$$

## When making predictions on new data, describe any modification to the batch normalization process post-training.

Once the network is trained, the parameters $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$, learned during training, are used directly for making predictions on new data without modification. This ensures consistent rescaling and shifting based on the learned parameters.
