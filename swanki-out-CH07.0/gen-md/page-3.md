## What is the Taylor expansion of the error function $E(\mathbf{w})$ around some point $\widehat{\mathbf{w}}$ in weight space?

The Taylor expansion of $E(\mathbf{w})$ around some point $\widehat{\mathbf{w}}$ is given by:

$$
E(\mathbf{w}) \simeq E(\widehat{\mathbf{w}})+(\mathbf{w}-\widehat{\mathbf{w}})^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{b}+\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{w}-\widehat{\mathbf{w}})^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{w}-\widehat{\mathbf{w}})
$$

where $\mathbf{b}$ is the gradient of $E$ evaluated at $\widehat{\mathbf{w}}$, and $\mathbf{H}$ is the Hessian at $\widehat{\mathbf{w}}$.

## Define the gradient $\mathbf{b}$ in terms of the error function $E(\mathbf{w})$.

The gradient $\mathbf{b}$ is defined as the gradient of the error function $E$ evaluated at the point $\widehat{\mathbf{w}}$:

$$
\mathbf{b} \equiv \nabla E|_{\mathbf{w}=\widehat{\mathbf{w}}}
$$

## What is the Hessian $\mathbf{H}$ in the context of the error function $E(\mathbf{w})$?

The Hessian $\mathbf{H}$ is defined as the matrix of second derivatives of the error function $E$ evaluated at the point $\widehat{\mathbf{w}}$:

$$
\mathbf{H}(\widehat{\mathbf{w}}) = \left.\nabla \nabla E(\mathbf{w})\right|_{\mathbf{w}=\widehat{\mathbf{w}}}
$$

## Why is it challenging to find a global minimum in the error function $E(\mathbf{w})$?

The error function $E(\mathbf{w})$ typically has a highly nonlinear dependence on the weights and biases, leading to many local minima where the gradient vanishes. This complexity makes it challenging to find the global minimum.

## Describe a scenario where local minima are encountered in weight space for a neural network.

In a two-layer network with $M$ hidden units, each point in weight space is part of a family of $M! 2^{M}$ equivalent points. Local minima arise due to the highly nonlinear and complex nature of the error surface.

## What insight does the local quadratic approximation of $E(\mathbf{w})$ provide into optimization techniques?

The local quadratic approximation of $E(\mathbf{w})$ provides insight into the optimization problem. By approximating $E(\mathbf{w})$ near a point $\widehat{\mathbf{w}}$ with a quadratic function, it becomes easier to analyze and apply various optimization techniques.
