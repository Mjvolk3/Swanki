                    1. Minimize the use of LaTeX equations. Describe equations in plain English when possible, spelling out the pronunciation of Greek letters. This includes no inline math or variables. For example, NEVER INCLUDE '\(' and or '\)' in the output message. NEVER USE '\mathbf{}' etc. NO LATEX or Latex related symbols! This is VERY important. 
                    2. Provide additional context and detailed explanations for definitions and their importance.
                    3. Give high-level overviews of theorems and derivations, focusing on the main intuitions behind them and by walking through the major steps involved.
                    4. Explain the main purpose of examples given in the original text by providing enough context to understand the problem and its solution.
                    5. Focus on intuitions, concepts, and the big picture, as if presenting the material to a student for the first time.
                    6. Avoid referencing the original text (e.g., "this chapter does...", "this part of the book says..."). Instead, narrate as if presenting your own material. Make sure all text is in the present tense.
                    7. Omit any exercises or problems at the end of chapters.
                    8. When encountering subscripts or superscripts, write them out in plain English (e.g., "Mu sub a" instead of "Mu_a", "Sigma squared" instead of "Sigma^2").
                    9. Add a "Section: " at the beginning of each section header to make the transcript easier to review. We do not need any special markdown formatting for this. Do not bold, or apply headers and it disturbs the audio model.
                    10. Make sure that each section is at least 3 paragraphs long and try to use the sections 
                    11. Do not use any markdown formatting except for numbered lists or bullet points when necessary.
                    12. Section headers should never just say "Summary." Try to be as descriptive as possible in section headers.
                    13. DO NOT repeat yourself. If you have already explained a concept, do not explain it again unless there is a new angle or insight to add.
                    14. Avoid Making lists of keys takeaways or bullet points. Instead, summarize the key points in a few sentences.
                    15. Translate math into spoken language. e.g. f(x) to 'f of x', x^2 to 'x squared', 'x^4' to 'x to the power of 4', > to 'greater than', < to 'less than', etc. Same with greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, etc. Symbols like λ, ∇ should be spelled out as 'lambda', 'nabla', etc. 
                    16. Again don't use '\(' or to bookend math '\)' just use symbols that can be spoken.
                    17. Do NOT includes sections on references or acknowledgments.
                    18. Insert natural pauses like this. `<break time="1.5s" />` . Insert a pause for 1.0 s at the end of paragraphs. Insert pause after very advanced technical explanation like the summary of equations pause for 1.5s.

                    Please review the provided transcript chunk and ensure it adheres to these guidelines. Maintain a consistent style throughout the transcript, taking into account the existing audio transcript provided. It is essential to preserve the original content as much as possible while adhering to the guidelines. Do not reduce the size of the transcript. If necessary, you may slightly expand the content to ensure clarity and coherence but again it is important you DO NOT repeat yourself.""",
